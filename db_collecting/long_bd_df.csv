To date, the pathogenesis of AD is unfortunately insufﬁciently elucidated. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore whether Salidroside (Sal) treatment could beneﬁt AD by improving pyroptosis. Firstly, two animal models of AD, induced, respectively, by A β 1-42 and D-galactose (D-gal)/AlCl 3, have been created to assist our appreciation of AD pathophysiology. We then conﬁrmed that pyroptosis is related to the pathogenesis of AD, and Sal can slow the progression of AD by inhibiting pyroptosis. Subsequently, we established the D-gal and Nigericin-induced PC12 cells injury model in vitro to verify Sal blocks pyroptosis mainly by targeting the NLRP3 inﬂammasome. For in vivo studies, we observed that A β accumulation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, neurons of hippocampal damage, and cognitive dysfunction in AD mice, caused by bilateral injection of A β 1-42 into the hippocampus and treatments with D-gal combine AlCl 3. Besides, accumulated Aβ promotes NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation, which leads to the activation and release of a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β ). Notably, both A β accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau decreased and inhibited pyroptosis by downregulating the expression of IL-1 β and IL-18, which can be attributed to the treatment of Sal. We further found that Sal can reverse the increased protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF- κ B, P-NF-κ B, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved Caspase-1, cleaved GSDMD, IL-1β , and IL-18 in vitro . The underlying mechanism may be through inhibiting TLR4/NF-κ B/NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway. Our study highlights the importance of NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis in AD, and how the administration of pharmacological doses of Sal can inhibit NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis and ameliorate AD. Thus, we conclude that NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis plays a signiﬁcant role in AD and Sal could be a therapeutic drug for AD.",316,0.pdf
1,Salidroside Ameliorates Alzheimer's Disease by Targeting NLRP3 Inflammasome-Mediated Pyroptosis,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.809433,introduction,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and language deterioration, and its incidence rate ranks ﬁrst globally (Alzheimer’s Association, 2021). The World Alzheimer Report 2021 reported that 50 million people worldwide have dementia. Every 3 s, someone in the world develops dementia. It is estimated that those suﬀering from dementia will grow from 55 to 139 million people during the period 2019–2050 (World Alzheimer Report 2021, 2021). β -Amyloid (A β ) deposits, Tau proteins hyperphosphorylated, and neuroinﬂammation are neuropathological hallmarks in AD (Emre ., 2021). According to the hypothesis of A β , on the one hand, the aggregation of A β can initiate a cascade of reactions, including triggering hyperphosphorylation of Tau to form neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinﬂammation, and neuronal degeneration, contributing to the onset of AD (Zhou and Fukushima, 2020). On the other hand, the activation and proliferation of astrocytes and microglia caused by A β accumulation (Terrill-Usery ., 2014) leads to the continuous exposure of neurons to pro-inﬂammatory mediators and results in neuronal dysfunction or death (Heneka ., 2014). Thus, the vital pathological features of AD outlined above can cause diﬀerent degrees of neuronal loss and brain atrophy (Zhuang ., 2019). Therefore, death neuronal is a root reason for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases (Hambright ., 2017). Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates pyroptosis may serve as the predominant form of neuronal death in AD following apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis (Fricker ., 2018; Shen ., 2021). Pyroptosis is a programmed cell death mediated by Gasdermin D (GSDMD) (Shi ., 2017), characterized by swelling, rupture of the cell membrane, drive to release pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, and intracellular contents, and then triggering the inﬂammatory response (Yu ., 2021). Pyroptosis occurs when activated caspase-1 or caspase-4/5/11 cleaves the protein GSDMD, releasing the GSDMD-N subunit to form cell membrane pores (Kovacs and Miao, 2017), which has been tightly linked to AD pathogenesis. Suppressed pyroptosis may be a protective measure for neurons (Zhao ., 2019). Studies have suggested that the inﬂammasome was involved in the onset of AD through triggering pyroptosis (Dempsey ., 2017). Among all inﬂammasomes, including nod-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1), nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), the nuclear eﬀector protein 4 (NLRC4), and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), extensive studies have focused on the NLRP3 inﬂammasome. NLRP3 inﬂammasome comprises three main components: receptor protein NLRP3, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and the eﬀector protein caspase-1 (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016). It is initiated by a variety of stimuli, namely, microbial infection PAMPs (such as viral DNA, microbes, and the components of the bacterial cell wall) and DAMPs (such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), uric acid (UA) crystals, Aluminum adjuvant, and A β peptide) (Huang ., 2021). Numerous research studies have examined how NLRP3 inﬂammasome is involved in AD pathogenesis through mediating pyroptosis. A study by Daniels . (2016) demonstrated that Fenamate NSAIDs improved the microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation and memory loss in 3×TgAD mice by indirectly inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inﬂammasome. Then, Chiu . (2021) found that SG-Tang could act as a neuroprotective agent against A β aggregation and neuroinﬂammation by regulating the NLRP1/NLRP3 pathway. Subsequently, Kuwar . (2021) suggested that loaded A β can be reduced signiﬁcantly, alleviate neuroinﬂammation, improve hippocampal neuronal activity, and relieve cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice via inhibiting NLRP3 inﬂammasome with JC124. Even though limited studies have probed the role and underlying mechanism of NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis in AD, the mechanisms of how NLRP3 inﬂammasome drive pyroptosis need further study. So far, clinical treatment of AD therapeutics has been dominated by the use of western medicine, that is to say, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, amyloid production or secretion inhibitors, and inﬂammation inhibitors (Orlov, 2019). Nevertheless, these drugs only partially relieve symptoms for a short time but cannot delay the progression of AD. To our relief, recent studies have reported that phytopharmaceutica ls, Salidroside can improve neuron impairments and cognitive deﬁcits in AD (Xie ., 2020). Rhodiola rosea L., a small genus of the Crassulaceae family, has a long history of wide use as a botanical medicine in Europe, Asia, and the US (Zhong ., 2018). With the continuous development and improvement of scientiﬁc research technology, many studies have examined the chemical constituents of Rhodiola plants at home and abroad. The main pharmacological active ingredients isolated from various Rhodiola are salidroside and its aglycone (tyrosol), rosavin or rosavidine, pyridine, and rhodiosin and rhodionin, etc (Zhang ., 2021). Among them, Salidroside is widely studied. Sal (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl-β -D-glucopyranoside) (Figure 2A) is a phenolic glycoside compound that is the main active ingredient extracted from Rhodiola Rose (Fan ., 2021). It has potent pharmacological activities, mainly for preventing or treating disorders like neurodegenerative diseases, cerebral ischemia, fatigue, hypoxia, diabetes, and cancer (Grech-Baran ., 2015). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that Sal can eﬀectively reduce A β 1-42 deposition and neuroinﬂammation in the brains of AD mice (Xie ., 2020), improve cognitive decline during aging, and thus exert neuronal protective eﬀects (Jin ., 2016). In their study, Xing . (2020) found that Sal attenuated pyroptosis by inhibiting caspase-1 activation, GSDMD cleaving, and reducing the interleukin-1 β (IL-1β ) release, ultimately reducing the form of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, in PD-related studies Zhang X. . (2020) also demonstrated that Sal has a therapeutic eﬀect on PD by inhibiting pyroptosis and thus dopamine neuron death. All in all, the above studies consistently conclude that Sal plays a potential neuroprotective role by inhibiting pyroptosis. Regrettably, the mechanism of how Sal protects neurons in AD through inhibiting pyroptosis is incomplete and has not been clariﬁed to date. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between AD and NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis via established Aβ 1-42, D-gal/AlCl 3 mouse models in vivo, and a D-gal, Nigericin treated PC12 cells damage model in vitro.",984,0.pdf
2,Salidroside Ameliorates Alzheimer's Disease by Targeting NLRP3 Inflammasome-Mediated Pyroptosis,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.809433,result,"Sal Improved A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 Induced Cognitive Dysfunction in Mice Open-Field Test An open-ﬁeld test was used to observe the spontaneous exploration activities of mice. As shown in Figure 2, compared with the control group, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the A β 1-42 group in the total distance (Figure 2B), the average velocity (Figure 2D), and the intermediate region motion time (Figure 2E), indicating that spontaneous exploration activities defect of A β 1-42-mice group. Above all, the AD mice treatment by Sal or DNP signiﬁcantly prolonged the intermediate region motion time and total distance, increasing the average velocity compared to A β 1-42-mice. The moving track of the mice in the center and surrounding areas is exhibited in Figure 2C. Thus, the results suggested that Sal can substantially improve the autonomous exploration activities of AD mice. The athletic capacity and anxiety levels of the mice were assessed by OFT (Liu ., 2021). In the OFT, the AD mice induced by D-gal/AlCl3 had fewer total distances than the control mice. The Sal or DNP group exhibited a total distance traveled than the D-gal/AlCl 3 group (Figure 2B). In terms of the time spent in intermediate quadrant results, the D-gal/AlCl 3-mice spent less time in intermediate quadrant than the normal mice (Figure 2E). However, the time spent in the middle quadrant was increased in the Sal or DNP group, compared with the D-gal/AlCl3 group, and the diﬀerence had statistical signiﬁcance. In addition, the average velocity of the D-gal/AlCl 3-mice was lower than the control group (Figure 2D). Conversely, the average speed has signiﬁcantly increased in the Sal or DNP group, compared to the D-gal/AlCl 3 group. Therefore, the result suggested that Sal can improve athletic capacity and anxiety in AD mice. Morris Water Maze We assessed the learning and memory functions of the AD mice by MWM. First, two-way ANOV A was conducted to analyze the escape latency in the place navigation trial. The results showed that mice treated with A β 1-42 exhibited prolonged escape latency compared to controls. In contrast, A β 1-42-mice with Sal or DNP treatment show shorter escape latency than A β 1-42-mice (Figure 3A). Second, during the spatial probe trial, the one-way ANOV A result indicated that performance was generally worse for the Aβ 1-42 group compared with the control group, including a decrease of the number of platform crossings (Figure 3B), curtailing the time spent in the target quadrant (Figure 3C), and reduced the total distance traveled in the target quadrant (Figure 3D). Meanwhile, in this test, Sal and DNP groups where Aβ 1-42 was co-administered with Sal or DNP were signiﬁcantly better than the A β 1-42 group (Figures 3B–D). Thus, the results revealed that Sal could ameliorate the learning and memory impairments induced by A β 1-42 in AD mice. The moving track of A β 1-42 induced mice during the place navigation trial (Figure 3E) and the spatial probe trial (Figure 3F). To investigate the eﬀect of Sal on the learning and memory function of AD mice induced by D-gal/AlCl 3, we tested the mice in a Morris Water Maze. This result is consistent with previous reports (Zhang ., 2019). An increase in escape latency in AD model mice was observed (Figure 3A). In contrast, the escape latency progressively shortened in the Sal or DNP group as time went on. On the sixth day, the number of platform crossings, the time spent in the target quadrant, total distance traveled in the D-gal/AlCl3-induced AD mice decreased in the D-gal/AlCl 3-mice when compared with the control group. Furthermore, the above-mentioned behavior improved after treatment with Sal or DNP (Figures 3B–D). These data suggest that Sal can ameliorate the learning and memory function of D-gal/AlCl 3-induced AD mice. The moving track of D-gal/AlCl3 induced mice during the place navigation trial (Figure 3E) and the spatial probe trial (Figure 3F). Sal Mitigated A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 Induced Hippocampus Neuronal Injury in Mice The neuron is believed to play a vital role in learning and memory functions. We, therefore, analyzed the number of neurons in the CA1, CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus by Nissl staining to investigate the eﬀects of Sal treatment on the neuronal morphology change. The neurons in the hippocampus area were in a larger quantity, arranged in neat rows, and rich in Nissl Bodies in the control group. In contrast, the neurons were decreased in quantity, arranged in a disorderedly fashion, with an obscure or disappeared karyopyknosis, or karyolysis, and poor in Nissl Bodies in the A β 1-42 group (Figure 4A). The Sal or DNP-treated groups reversed the above pathological features, namely, the neurons were high in quantity, arranged neatly, with more Nissl Bodies, little karyopyknosis, and karyolysis as seen in Figure 4A. All in all, these data demonstrated that Sal could attenuate its neuronal death. To determine whether Sal protects the neurons from D-gal/AlCl3-induced damage, we performed Nissl staining to analyze the shape of neurons in the hippocampus of AD mice. Nissl staining revealed that D-gal/AlCl 3-mice exhibited neuronal pyknosis and signiﬁcantly reduced neuronal counts. Conversely, in the Sal or DNP group, the above mentioned pathological features were ameliorated, and the density of neurons also increased signiﬁcantly (Figure 4A). Together, these results indicate that Sal ameliorated the damage of neurons induced by D-gal/AlCl 3. Sal Decreased A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 Induced the Increased of A β 1-42 and P-Tau in Mice Aggregation of both A β and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein is a primary hallmark of AD (Bakota and Brandt, 2016). To explore the eﬀect of Sal on A β 1-42-mice, we examined the expression of A β and p-Tau in the brain of AD mice by Enzyme-linked immunoassay kits (ELISA), Immunohistochemical staining, and Western blotting analysis. Figures 4, 5 exhibit that the level of Aβ was signiﬁcantly increased for the A β 1-42-mice compared with the regular group, as measured by the ELISA kit. This data indicates that the AD model was prepared successfully. In addition, the levels of A β 1-42 in the Sal or DNP group were lower compared with A β 1-42-mice (Figure 4B), suggesting that Sal treatment was not inferior to DNP. The expression of A β and P-Tau protein was upregulated in the A β 1-42 group, as indicated by western blotting while the presentation of A β 1-42, p-Tau dropped in the DNP group. For comparison, this downregulate tendency was more pronounced in the Sal group (Figure 4C). Furthermore, Immunohistochemical staining showed that A β and p-Tau positive areas were signiﬁcantly increased in the hippocampal region of the A β 1-42 group, with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence compared with the regular group. Increased yellowish-brown A β plaque deposition and brown P-Tau deposits in the model group. Conversely, treatment with Sal or DNP marked reduced the positive area of A β and P-Tau in the hippocampal region, the yellowish-brown A β plaque deposition and brown P-Tau deposits are both decreased, with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence compared with the A β 1-42 group (Figures 5A,B). In short, the above results demonstrated that Sal could exert therapeutic eﬀects on AD by directly reducing both deposition of the A β peptide levels and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau. To determine whether Sal treatment can decrease the A β accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in D-gal/AlCl 3-mice, we ﬁrst carried out analyses by ELISA kits. The results indicated that the deposition of A β increased in the model group, which implied that the AD model was established successfully. Nevertheless, Sal, DNP groups all presented reductions in the Aβ deposition compared with the D-gal/AlCl 3 group, meaning Sal has similar eﬃcacy to DNP to exert therapy eﬀect on AD (Figure 4B). Next, to further conﬁrm the impact of Sal on the accumulation of A β and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in AD mice, the relative expression levels of Tau, p-Tau, and A β in the brain of AD mice were examined by Western blotting (Figure 4C). The result demonstrated that the expressions of p-Tau and A β were reduced in the Sal or DNP group, and the statistical signiﬁcance of the diﬀerences for comparison D-gal/AlCl3 group. Finally, IHC was performed. As shown in Figures 5A,B, the yellowish-brown A β plaque deposition and brown P-Tau deposits are both decreased in the Sal or DNP group. In summary, these ﬁndings suggest that Sal can improve the A β loaded and phosphorylation of Tau and subsequent pathology of D-gal/AlCl 3-mice. Sal Inhibited A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 Induced Pyroptosis in Mice In the present study, ELISA was used to evaluate the inﬂammatory cytokines, namely, IL-1 β and IL-18. Based on the ELISA results, the expression level of IL-1 β and IL-18 were signiﬁcantly elevated in the brain of AD mice induced by A β 1-42, suggesting that IL-1 β and IL-18 are cytokines that play crucial roles in pyroptosis and the onset of AD. As Figure 6 shows, the A β 1-42-mice treat applied Sal, the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the A β 1-42 group (Figures 6A,B). Subsequently, we further investigated the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, that is to say, IL-1β , IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD by western blotting. Results demonstrated that the protein level of IL-1 β , IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD increased in the A β 1-42 group compared with the regular group (Figure 6C). In comparison, the Sal group found a markedly reduced expression level of IL-1 β , IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD. Notably, GSDMD-N was cleaved by activated GSDMD, which could motivate the secretion of IL-1 β , IL-18, and subsequently drive pyroptosis (He ., 2015). These results imply that pyroptosis is closely related to AD, and Sal could prevent pyroptosis in A β 1-42-induced AD mice. GSDMD is a crucial biomarker of pyroptosis. To explore the action and mechanism of Sal in pyroptosis, we assessed both the IL-1 β and IL-18 and the expression of GSDMD proteins related to the pyroptosis by ELISA kits and Western blotting analysis. ELISA results indicated that treatment with Sal gradually downregulated the secretion of IL-1 β and IL-18 induced by D-gal/AlCl 3 (Figures 6A,B). Western blot further conﬁrmed our results. The result showed that the protein levels of IL-1 β . IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD decreased in the Sal group (Figure 6C). These results demonstrate that pyroptosis may involve AD onset, and Sal could ameliorate the course of AD through inhibited pyroptosis. Sal Attenuated A β 1-42-Induced Pyroptosis Through Modulation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1 Signaling Pathways in Mice To explore Sal’s action and underlying mechanism in pyroptosis induced by A β 1-42, we validated it using IHC and western blotting. The western blotting results suggested that the expression of the proteins of NLRP3, ASC and cleaved Caspase-1 levels were increased in the A β 1-42-group (Figure 7A), the high expression of these proteins could be inhibited by administration with Sal. Consistently, the IHC exhibited that the increased brown NLRP3, cleaved Caspase-1 deposits were seen in the hippocampus of AD mice, and the brown deposits were suppressed with Sal, which indicates Sal can inhibit NLRP3/Caspase-1 (Figures 8A,B). Thus, the above data show that Sal can mitigate pyroptosis by inhibiting the NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathway. Sal Attenuated D-gal/AlCl 3-Induced Pyroptosis Through Modulation of the TLR4/NF-κ B/MyD88/NLRP3 and NLRP3/Caspase-1 Signaling Pathways in Mice Aβ 1-42 models for the potential mechanisms of Sal have revealed that Sal can ameliorate the pathological features of AD via inhibited pyroptosis. To further conﬁrm how Sal modulates pyroptosis, and in turn, intervenes in the pathogenesis of AD, we validated the results obtained from the A β 1-42 mice model using the D-gal/AlCl 3 mice model. As expected, Western blotting results showed an increase of TLR4, MyD88, p-NF- κ B, NLRP3, ASC, and Cleaved Caspase-1 protein expression levels in the model group. Conversely, these protein expressions were reduced in the Sal group (Figures 7A,B). Furthermore, the result of IHC is consistent with A β 1-42-mice (Figures 7C, 8A,B). Normal brain tissue sections showed no signiﬁcant positive expression under high magniﬁcation and increased brown TLR4, NLRP3, cleaved Caspase-1 deposits were seen in the hippocampus of AD mice, and small amounts of brown deposits were seen in the Sal groups. Thus, the above experiments veriﬁed that Sal inhibits pyroptosis by suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κ B/NLRP3 and NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway. Sal Protected PC12 Cells Against D-gal-Induced Cytotoxicity and Improved Viability To screen an optimum action concentration of D-gal, we ﬁrst added D-gal (10, 15, 30, 40, 50 mg/ml) to 96-well culture plates and allowed it to act on the PC12 cells for 48 h. As Figure 9 shows, cell viability decreased with the increase of D-gal action concentration, detected by the CCK8 assay (Figure 9B). Finally, D-gal (15 mg/ml), was selected as working concentrations for the subsequent experiments. To explore the action of Sal in D-gal induced cytotoxic and neuroprotective eﬀects on PC12 cells, assays were performed using a CCK-8 assay. As shown in Figure 9, after PC12 cells were exposed to Sal (2, 10, 50 µ M) for 24 h, there were no signiﬁcant hits for the viability of PC-12 cells (Figure 9A), suggesting that Sal did not alter the survival of PC12 cells. Subsequently, 2, 10, and 50 µ M of Sal were added to the culture media, and cells were pre-incubated for 2 h. Then, the cells were incubated with D-gal (15 mg/ml) for 48 h, ﬁnally using CCK-8 for analyses. As shown in Figure 9C, the percentage of PC12 cells was signiﬁcantly increased in the Sal-treated group compared to the D-gal group. The result implied that Sal might act to prevent PC12 cells from damage. Protective Effects of Sal Against PC12 Cells Damage Induced by D-gal via Regulating TLR4/NF-κ B/NLRP3/Caspase-1 Signaling Pathway To explore the underlying mechanisms of D-gal induced PC12 cells damage, ELISA was applied to determine the secretion of IL-1 β and IL-18. Results indicated that Sal considerably decreased the expression of IL-18 and IL-1 β in D-gal-induced PC12 cells, suggesting that Sal can exert mitigated pyroptosis via the decreased release of inﬂammatory factors (Figure 9E). Meanwhile, Western blotting analysis was used to analyze the TLR4-related and the NLRP3-related signaling pathway protein to verify the above hypothesis further. Consistent results were obtained. Protein expression was downregulated in the Sal group, including TLR4, MyD88, p-NF- κ B, NLRP3, ASC, Cleaved Caspase-1, Cleaved GSDMD, IL-1 β , and IL-18 (Figures 9F–H). Furthermore, immunoﬂuorescence assays conﬁrmed that the expression of TLR4, NLRP3, and cleaved Caspase-1 were signiﬁcantly reduced by treatment with Sal (Figure 9I). The above result is consistent with the previous two AD mice model results, indicating that Sal could suppress pyroptosis by inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κ B/NLRP3 and NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathways in D-gal-induced PC-12 cells. Effect of Sal on Nigericin-Induced NLRP3 Activation in PC12 Cells CCK-8 assays were conducted to screen a suitable concentration of Nigericin for our experiment. The Nigericin concentration chosen for this screening was 10 µ M (Figure 9D). As demonstrated for A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 AD mice models and PC12 cells model, pyroptosis plays a critical role in the progression of various nervous system diseases (such as AD, PD, HD, and ALS) (Voet ., 2019). In the present experiment, we aimed to explore the mechanism of Sal during the pathogenesis of AD. To further explore the action of Sal on NLRP3 activation, Western blotting was used to assess changes in NLRP3 and its downstream proteins in Nigericin + Sal-treated PC12 cells. As indicated in the ﬁgure, the level of NLRP3 and its downstream proteins was noticeably increased in the D-gal group compared to the normal group. By contrast, the level of NLRP3 was decreased in the Sal group compared with the D-gal group. Interestingly, compared with the Sal group, the Nigericin group eﬃciently reversed the reduced level of NLRP3 eﬀectively while increasing the level of ASC, cleaved Caspase-1, cleaved GSDMD, IL-1 β , and IL-18, a downstream target of NLRP3 (Figure 9J). Thus, the above results conﬁrmed that Sal inhibited pyroptosis mainly through targeting suppression of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome. NLRP3 Is Involved in the Inhibitory Effect of Sal on D-gal-Induced PC12 Cells Pyroptosis We hypothesized that Sal acts against D-gal-induced NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation by downregulating NLRP3. To test this, we knocked down NLRP3 expression in PC12 cells by siRNA. Firstly, the Western blot result showed that the sequence 1 of NLRP3 siRNA had a better eﬀect in silencing NLRP3 (Figure 10A). As shown in Figure 10B, we found that the NLRP3 siRNA group or Salidroside signiﬁcantly reversed D-gal induces upregulation of cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1β , and IL-18, further suggesting that NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis plays a central role in AD. At the same time, compared with the NLRP3 siRNA group, the Salidroside combined NLRP3 siRNA group failed to change the protein expression of cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1 β , and IL-18 in PC12 cells (Figure 10B). Moreover, NLRP3 siRNA or Salidroside rescued in cell viability induced by D-gal, and the Salidroside combined NLRP3 siRNA group failed to change cell viability compared with NLRP3 siRNA (Figure 10C). Collectively, the above data demonstrate that Salidroside inhibited pyroptosis by targeting the NLRP3 inﬂammasome.",2858,0.pdf
3,Metabolic reprogramming in inflammatory microglia indicates a potential way of targeting inflammation in Alzheimer's disease,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2023.102846,abstract,"Microglia activation drives the pro-inflammatory activity in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanistic basis is elusive, and the hypothesis of targeting microglia to prevent AD onset is little explored. Here, we demonstrated that upon LPS exposure, microglia shift towards an energetic phenotype characterised by high glycolysis and high mitochondrial respiration with dysfunction. Although the activity of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes is boosted by LPS, this is mostly devoted to the generation of reactive oxygen species. We showed that by inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) with dimethyl malonate (DMM), it is possible to modulate the LPS-induced metabolic rewiring, facilitating an anti-inflammatory phenotype. DMM improves mitochondrial function in a direct way and by reducing LPS-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, the block of SDH with DMM inhibits the recruitment of hypoxia inducible-factor 1 α (HIF-1 α ), which mediates the induction of glycolysis and cytokine expression. Similar bioenergetic alterations were observed in the microglia isolated from AD mice (3xTg-AD), which present high levels of circulating LPS and brain toll-like receptor4 (TLR4). Moreover, this well-established model of AD was used to show a potential effect of SDH inhibition in vivo as DMM administration abrogated brain inflammation and modulated the microglia metabolic alterations of 3xTg-AD mice. The RNA-sequencing analysis from a public dataset confirmed the consistent transcription of genes encoding for ETC subunits in the microglia of AD mice (5xFAD). In conclusion, TLR4 activation promotes metabolic changes and the pro-inflammatory activity in microglia, and SDH might represent a promising therapeutic target to prevent AD development.",253,1.pdf
4,Metabolic reprogramming in inflammatory microglia indicates a potential way of targeting inflammation in Alzheimer's disease,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2023.102846,introduction,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, a continuous decline in thinking, behavioural and social skills. AD is macroscopically characterised by a cortical atrophy, while on the cellular level, extracellular inflammatory or neuritic (NP) senile plaques can be found, consisting of beta-type amyloid (A β ) protein aggregates and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyper-phosphorylated tau protein aggregates [ 1 ]. However, microglia, “brain-resident macrophages”, have recently emerged as major pathogenic drivers in almost all neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [ 2 ]. When activated, microglia adopt an inflammatory phenotype and exert a neurotoxic effect through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-1 β , TNF- α and IL-6) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 2 ]. Recently, the key role of toll-like receptors (TLRs), and in particular TLR4, in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, has emerged [ 3 , 4 ]. In the brain, TLR4 is mainly expressed on the surface of microglia, and in AD its expression increases in parallel with accumulation of A β , leading to microglia activation with consequent inflammation, neuronal dysfunction and further A β and tau deposition [ 5 ]. Therefore, although TLR4 is conventionally considered the key receptor for LPS recognition [ 6 , 7 ], it seems to be also involved in phagocytosis and removal of A β plaque [ 8 , 9 ]. On the other hand, high levels of LPS have been found in the blood and in the brain of AD patients, so that LPS has been proposed as a mediator between gut dysbiosis and amyloid pathology [ 10 , 11 ]. Overall, these findings have suggested to target TLR4 in preclinical studies, showing some beneficial effects in terms of neuronal inflammation and oxidative stress [ 12 ]. However, despite the promising results, the translational approach is not feasible yet and the research of other interacting factors is needed. Recent evidence reported that TLR4-mediated inflammatory activity seems to be fuelled by a metabolic reprogramming as LPS-activated microglia rely on glycolysis, and cytokine production increases under high-glucose conditions [ 6 , 7 ]. In accord, glucose seems to be the main energy source for microglia in AD, although other substrates can be also used [ 8 ]. In this regard, studies of immunometabolism shed light on the importance of metabolic reprogramming as a driving force of pro-inflammatory activation and cell differentiation in immune cells, including macrophages [ 9 ]. It is conventionally known that activated M1 macrophages rely on glycolytic metabolism to supply the pro-inflammatory activity, while oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) would represent the main energy source of resting and regulatory phenotypes (e.g. M2 macrophages or Treg lymphocytes) [ 13 – 15 ]. Since the TLR4-mediated activation of microglia reflects an important player in AD, we investigated the role of microglia immunometabolism by dissecting cellular bioenergetics in LPS-activated human microglia, and studying potential applications in a well-established murine model of AD.",483,1.pdf

We found that inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) with dimethyl malonate (DMM) effectively modulated this LPS-induced metabolic rewiring, promoting an anti-inflammatory phenotype. DMM treatment improved mitochondrial function and reduced LPS-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, blocking SDH with DMM inhibited the recruitment of HIF-1 α , a key mediator of glycolysis and cytokine expression. Similar metabolic alterations were observed in microglia isolated from 3xTg-AD mice, which showed elevated levels of circulating LPS and brain TLR4. In vivo administration of DMM to 3xTg-AD mice abrogated brain inflammation and normalized microglial metabolic profiles. RNA-sequencing analysis of microglia from a public dataset of 5xFAD mice confirmed the upregulation of genes encoding ETC subunits. These findings collectively suggest that TLR4 activation drives metabolic changes and pro-inflammatory activity in microglia, and that SDH inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing AD development.",166,1.pdf

AD pathology is characterized by amyloid fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, consistently colocalizes with the amyloid deposits is characteristic of Alz -heimer ’ s disease and may contribute to the generation of amyloid proteins. AChE is a potent amyloid-promoting factor as compared with other associated proteins. AChE inhibitors play a vital role to prevent the formation of toxic oligomeric form of amyloid peptide. Recent studies have reported that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChE- Is) are present in plants, fungi, and marine products. Some cholinesterase inhibitors, obtained from plant source such as rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine, used in the treatment of AD, offer an alternative approach to alleviate its symptoms by reducing A β . Due to limited efficacy of currently available drugs for AD, there is huge potential of phytomedicines for the treatment of AD. Medicinal herbs and herbal drug preparations have traditionally been used to treat neurological disorders such as AD by exhibiting its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Phytomedicines con -taining flavonoids, polyphenols, and other naturally occurring antioxidants crosses the blood-brain barrier and protect neurons from oxidative stress. As compared to synthetic drugs, phytomedicines have fewer side effects. Therefore, recent research is focused to explore the potential of phytomedicines and develop it as effective treatment for AD. In our review, we summarized the pathology of AD, amyloid-deposition, role of Acetylcho -linesterase, potential of phytoconstituents with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity for AD treatment.",269,2.pdf
7,Natural acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: A multi-targeted therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmcr.2024.100154,introduction,"Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by ageing and selective loss of neurons leading to impairment of learning and memory [ 1 ]. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, and amyloid-beta peptide deposition around dystrophic reactive glial cells are neuropathological hallmarks in AD patients [ 2 ]. The primary component of senile plaques and significantly increased neurotoxin (amyloid-beta peptide) are linked to dysfunction of laminin, apolipo -protein E, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [ 3 , 4 ]. Co-localization of A β deposits with AChE has been observed in mature senile plaques, pre-amyloid diffused deposits, and cerebral blood vessels [ 5 , 6 ]. AChE activity in the AD brain is linked to the amyloid core of senile plaques, rather than the neuritic (senile plaques) [ 7 ]. Amyloidoses is a protein-misfolding disorders characterized by accumulation of insoluble fibrillar protein complexes in the extracellular component. There are 25 forms of human proteins and polypeptides as amyloid deposits, including the prion protein (PrP) and 39-43-residue amyloid peptide in AD [ 8 ]. Choline acetyltransferase is a single-strand globular protein that catalyzes the biosynthetic reaction of the acetylcholine neurotrans -mitter, while acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes acetylcholine into acetic acid and choline in the central nervous system (CNS) [ [ 5 , 9 – 11 ]]. Ma -jority of AChE molecules are present in tetrameric form AChE to neuronal cell membranes and involved in both cholinergic and non-cholinergic function in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Biochemical studies showed that neurotoxicity accelerated by AChE-A β complexes increases neurodegeneration as compared to amyloid- β peptides alone [ 11 ]. AChE catalytic activity is crucial for cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation [ 12 ]. Inhibiting the activity of the AChE enzyme increases acetylcholine level, which is essential for transmission between brain cells by breaking it down into acetylcholine in the brain [ 13 ]. In AD patients, cortical cholinergic function is compromised due to decreased cerebral choline acetyl -transferase production, which decrease the acetylcholine synthesis [ 14 ]. Several types of neurons deteriorate as AD progresses, however, fore -brain cholinergic neurons suffer a profound loss and accompanied by steady decline of acetylcholine. ChAT, the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, and AChE activity are vastly affected in AD [ 15 ]. Despite the overall decrease in the activity of AChE in the AD patient, current AD therapy mostly targets the inhibitors of AChE (AChE-I), which enhance cholinergic transmission, but have modest and transient therapeutic effects [ 16 ]. Although the distribution of AChE molecular forms spe -cifically affects the AD brain, the pathophysiological relevance and subsequent ramifications of these alterations in AChE enzyme remain unknown even though it has been known for almost 50 years. An increase in AChE enzyme levels is a hallmark of AD [ 17 ]. For Alzheimer ’ s disease treatment, only a few synthetic medications are approved by the FDA, and it provides only symptomatic relief and have more side effects. Phytomedicine has been explored as an alternative approach to alleviate Alzheimer ’ s symptoms [ 18 , 19 ]. Some plants contain phytochemicals (Curcumin, Resveratrol, Epigallocate -chin-3-gallate, Morin, Delphinidins, Quercetin, Luteolin) that enhances brain function and counteract oxidative stress. The therapeutic potential of herbal remedies, including Lavandula angustifolia, Ginkgo biloba , and Salvia officinalis has been shown to improve cognitive performance in mild to moderate AD [ 20 , 21 ]. Certain plants contain natural compounds that improve brain func -tion and fight oxidative stress. Herbal remedies like lavender, ginkgo biloba, and sage have been found to enhance cognitive abilities in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) [ 22 ]. These natural compounds may offer a new and effective strategy to treat AD and delay its onset. Some promising plant-based treatments are currently undergoing trials for AD. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) show promise for delivering therapies for neurodegenerative diseases worldwide because they can interact with cells effectively [ 23 ]. Researchers are also exploring vaccines as a new approach to treating AD [ 24 ], targeting key factors like tau protein and beta-amyloid plaques. Developing drugs that can target multiple aspects of the disease simul -taneously is becoming more important. Exosomes, tiny vesicles that can cross the blood-brain barrier, are being investigated for their potential to deliver treatments directly to the brain for conditions like AD [ 25 ]. Our review article provides an overview of Alzheimer ’ s disease, including its pathology, amyloid-deposition, and the role of acetylcholinesterase. It also highlights the potential of phytoconstituents with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity for the treatment of AD.",762,2.pdf
8,Natural acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: A multi-targeted therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmcr.2024.100154,result,"Different molecular forms of AChE can exist, each with a unique expression pattern in various cell types and a distinct subcellular distribution, which likely reflects a specific physiological function of each form. There may be novel applications for AChE that are unrelated to cholinergic neurotransmission [ 115 ]. Both cholinergic and non-cholinergic brain regions contain AChE, but the functional impor -tance of the non-cholinergic AChE is still unknown. The AChE species present in non-pathological and AD brains exhibit various characteris -tics. Even in pathological areas, the decline of AChE activity in the AD brain is not solely due to cholinergic reduction, as the density of AChE-rich fibers decreases in cortical areas of AD patients but is not correlated with the number of AChE-rich neurons [ 116 , 117 ]. Thus, an alteration in AChE levels may not reflect a change in cholinergic neuro transmission in the brain region. Not all molecular forms of AChE are equally affected in the AD brain. While most studies on the two main AChE subtypes in the mammalian brain, tetrameric and monomeric species with altered G4/G1 molecular form ratios, focus on neuro -chemical and neuroanatomical characteristics, the lighter species are conserved or even augmented in severely damaged cases of AD, whereas the G4 form is selectively lost in the AD brain. The AChE species that make up the majority of plasma forms are also more prevalent in AD plasma. Recent human investigations have demonstrated that AChE monomeric species are increased in the brains of transgenic mice (Tg2576) and the APPC100 mouse strain, which overproduces human A β in the brain. It has also been reported that amyloid-beta may have an impact on AChE [ 117 ]. AChE ’ s action on A β aggregation leads to the creation of amyloid fibrils. AChE serves as a seed or nucleation factor, and it is absorbed into the process of A β aggregation at every stage. It also contributes to the elongation of the amyloid fibrils. AChE act as a chaperone to facilitate the assembly of A β into oligo -mers with more structural complexity, such as amyloid fibrils, by shortening the lag phase of peptide aggregation Fig. 8 [ 117 ]. There are two possible mechanisms by which AChE may function in this process: firstly, by increasing the seeds needed for the nucleation step, and sec -ondly, by inducing fibril elongation [ 87 ]. AChE activity becomes evident when the enzyme is closely associated with amyloid deposits. Senile plaques in the brain of AD patients were described by Mesulam and Geula [ 170 ]. Using electron microscopy and a monoclonal antibody coated with gold particles have shown the growing amyloid fibrils in the AD patient. It demonstrated, how a small portion of the enzyme becomes closely associated with the amyloid fibril [ 118 ]. The process of converting soluble A β into amyloid fibrils is nucleation-dependent and associated with the structural conversion of A β [ [ 4 , 12 , 119 ]]. In vivo studies have demonstrated the binding of AChE to A β , with AChE binding to A β -coated wells at levels five to six times higher than that observed with BSA-coated wells, as determined by ELISA testing [ 120 ]. Several in vivo investigations have shown that AChE promotes A β aggregation and amyloid fibril production. AChE also accelerates the deposition of A β [ 121 ]. Double-transgenic mouse model that overexpresses human APP and human AChE has shown the accumulation of larger plaques in transgenic mice compared to control animals, as well as cognitive impairment [ 122 ]. Expression and distribution of AChE are altered in the brains with AD lesions [ 4 ]. Decreased AChE activity has been observed in the cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus basalis of Meynert, which are associated AD. Ratios of the altered forms of AChE changes with a decreased tetrameric globular G4 AChE form. Simultaneously mono -meric Gi and asymmetric AChE forms are increased, although the latter typically make up a small portion of the total enzyme in the human brain. AChE co-localize with A β deposits in cerebral blood vessels, pre-amyloid diffuse deposits, and mature senile plaques [ 123 ]. The deposition of A β is a critical stage in AD-related neurodegenerative processes, and elements of senile plaques, including AChE, are likely to cause selective neuronal cell death, indicating a significant involvement in AD pathogenesis. In fact, the expression of AD is the primary distinguishing hallmark of degenerating neurons, and groups of neurons that do not possess choline acetyltransferase exhibit AD. The majority of cortical AD activity in the AD brain has likely accelerated A β ′ s accu -mulation into amyloid fibrils, enhancing its toxicity [ 124 ]. Reduction of ACh production and alterations of A β -AChE complexes leads to neuronal death in AD, which is a major contributor to cholin -ergic deficits in the brain [ 1 ]. These deficits, in turn affects AChR levels and lead to further downstream effects, including the synthesis of A β . It is believed that amyloidogenic process results from soluble A β -isoforms is relatively benign nucleation-dependent process as compared to A β aggregation into amyloid fibrils. This complex process involves multiple factors and pathways, and the understanding of its underlying mecha -nisms remains an active area of research in AD [ 57 ]. Molecular dynamic methods have been used to simulate the binding of A β to catalytic subunit of AChE to identify the AChE motif that pro -motes A β fibril production. This investigation identified four possible sites. Site I covering the primary hydrophobic sequence exposed on the surface of AChE. H peptide, a 3.4 kDa polypeptide [ 116 ], has been shown by turbidity data to accelerate the production of A β fibrils. This location ’ s ability to interact with cell membranes correlates with a hy -drophobic AChE sequence. The AChE motif promoting A β fibril pro -duction is located at the tryptophan, a conserved amino acid residue in the PAS (peripheral anionic site) of the catalytic subunit of AChE. The active site at the bottom should be accessible to both PAS and effective therapeutic AChE inhibitors. The latter site enhances catalytic efficiency by temporarily binding ACh until it AChEs the acylation site and serve as connections between AChE and A β . Ligands that bind to PAS show ef -ficacy by speeding up processes towards the acylation site. The poly -amine caproctamine, binding to the peripheral anionic site of AChE has been developed as a non-covalent inhibitor of AChE [ 116 ]. AChE-Aβ complex fibrils is neurotoxic, similar to amyloid fibrils is toxic to neuronal cells in culture. To explore this, studies have been conducted in cell cultures and in vivo with AChE-Aβ complexes and Aβ aggregates [125]. AChE-Aβ complexes significantly affects the behavior of cells as compared to Aβ aggregates. Recent in vivo comparisons of the neuropathological changes caused by human Aβ fibrils and AChE-Aβ complexes in rat hippocampus indicates that AChE-Aβ complexes cause a more severe response than Aβ fibrils alone. In vitro research reports that AChE substantially increases rat Aβ aggregation, and in vivo in -vestigations reports AChE-Aβ deposits, which attracted endogenous Aβ peptide [126]. Furthermore, the presence of neurons expressing laminin around the AChE-Aβ deposits in vivo suggests that these deposits recruit endogenous Aβ peptide. Recent study supports the idea that AChE-Aβ complexes are more toxic than Aβ fibrils and AChE is responsible for some of the neurodegenerative changes observed in AD brains by increasing Aβ deposition. These findings are supported by various in vivo and in vitro investigations [116,126–128]. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common form of dementia character -ized by memory impairment and neurological symptoms. The Food and Drug Administration has approved (synthetic medications) only a limited number of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) and N-methyl D-aspartate receptor blockers (memantine). However, these treatments are focused on a single target and only pro -vide relief from symptoms rather than modifying the disease [18,129]. They are also known to have negative effects, including nausea, vom -iting, diarrhea, headAChE, dizziness, fatigue, muscle spasms, and insomnia. However Herbal medicine is being increasingly explored as an alternative approach to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease [129]. Certain plants contain phytochemicals that can enhance brain function, and their antioxidant properties (including flavonoids, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E) can potentially counteract oxidative stress, which is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. New effective ther -apeutic agents with fewer side effects are needed [129]. Although syn -thetic medications are routinely used, herbal medicines have gained attention for their benefits and minimal side effects. This article reviews the therapeutic effects of phytomedicines in the prevention and treat -ment of AD, with a focus on herbal remedies such as Lavandula angus -tifolia, Ginkgo biloba, Melissa officinalis, Crocus sativus, Ginseng, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and Magnolia officinalis [ [18,129–131]]. The paper also discusses recent research on the protective and therapeutic effects of these herbal remedies on AD, and evaluates their potential as alternative treatments for the disease. Currently, the most commonly drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s disease are acetylcholinesterase/cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is). The first ChE-I to be approved for the symptomatic therapy of AD was tacrine, but it is no longer used due to hepatotoxicity. Currently avail -able ChE-Is are donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine [130,131]. In addition, some natural phytocompounds such as Curcumin, Varenicline, Huperrtzine, Resveratrol, and Cycloastrageno have received FDA approval to treat Alzheimer’s disease (Table 1). The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasing due to aging population, posing a significant threat to the health of elderly individuals. Despite the absence of an effective treatment for AD, pathophysiology of AD and potential therapeutic agents have been explored extensively. Natural products have gained significant attention due to their unique advantages. One such compound has the potential to become a multi-target drug by interacting with various targets related to AD [130,137]. Structural modifications can be made to enhance inter -action and decrease toxicity. Hence, research on natural products and their derivatives for treating pathological changes in AD is crucial. The focus of most of the research discussed in this review is on natural compounds and their derivatives for AD treatment [88]. Natural prod -ucts have been a focus of research for their potential as acetyl cholin -esterase inhibitors (AChEIs), with several plant-derived compounds being identified as having AChEI activity [138]. Alkaloids are one of the most common groups of AChEIs found in plants, but other groups of compounds like sterols, flavonoids, terpenes, and glycosides have also been shown to inhibit AChE [139]. Some examples of natural products with AChEI activity include huperzine A, galantamine, physostigmine, and rivastigmine (Table 2). Huperzine A and Galantamine have been used clinically to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Both drugs are effective to treat age-related memory impairment or dementia, but its cognitive effects on patients with moderate AD are inconclusive [140,141]. Salvia officinalis L. has shown to improve cognitive performance in patients with mild to moderate AD and attenuate cognitive impairment in patients with moderate to severe AD [142]. However, long-term efficacy, safety, and administration strategy require further investigation. Crocus sativus L. dried extract has also shown significant improvement in cognitive ca -pacity in individuals suffering from mild-to-moderate AD, comparable to that observed in donepezil-treated patients [ 143 ]. Phytomedicines have been used for medicinal purposes for centuries and are divided into four categories based on their origin and evolution. These medicines contain phytoconstituents that are known for their pharmacological effects on the body and are used globally. However, the lack of data on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines has led to insufficient regulation. Critics of phytomedicines have called for more clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy before they are accepted as evidence-based medicines. Clinical trials can only begin after the collection of relevant preclinical data and approval from rele -vant health authorities/ethics committees [ 144 ]. The drug development process is a long, costly, and high-risk endeavour due to lack of clinical efficacy, unmanageable toxicity, poor drug-like properties, and lack of commercial needs. The complexity of biological systems, the narrow focus on drug targets, and the lack of robust biomarkers can all contribute to the high failure rate. To improve the success rate, a more holistic understanding of disease biology, the development of more reliable biomarkers, collaborations between stakeholders, and the use of new technologies like artificial intelligence can all play a crucial role [145]. There have been several instances of phytomedicines showing moderate efficacy in clinical trials. One example is the herbal drug St John’s wort, which has been traditionally used to treat depression. However, a large-scale clinical trial conducted in 2002 found that St John’s wort did not show significant efficacy [146]. Another example is the herbal drug Echinacea, which is commonly used as a natural remedy for the common cold. However, a clinical trial conducted in 2005 found that echinacea was less effective in preventing or treating the common cold [147]. A third example is the herbal drug ginkgo biloba, which is commonly used to improve memory and cognitive function. However, a large-scale clinical trial conducted in 2008 found that ginkgo biloba was not significantly effective than a placebo in preventing cognitive decline in older adults [148]. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct non-clinical study and proceed with multi-centric double-blind place-control clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy.",2235,2.pdf
9,GSK3: A potential target and pending issues for treatment of Alzheimer's disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.14818,abstract,"Glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK3), consisting of GSK3 α and GSK3 β subtypes, is a complex protein kinase that regulates numerous substrates. Research has observed increased GSK3 expression in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and models. AD is a neurodegenerative disorder with diverse pathogenesis and notable cognitive impairments, characterized by A β aggregation and excessive tau phosphorylation. This article provides an overview of GSK3's structure and regulation, extensively analyzing its relationship with AD factors. GSK3 overactivation disrupts neural growth, development, and function. It directly promotes tau phosphorylation, regulates amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, leading to A β formation, and directly or indirectly triggers neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. We also summarize preclinical research highlighting the inhibition of GSK3 activity as a primary therapeutic approach for AD. Finally, pending issues like the lack of highly specific and affinity-driven GSK3 inhibitors, are raised and expected to be addressed in future research.

10,GSK3: A potential target and pending issues for treatment of Alzheimer's disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.14818,introduction,"Glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK3) was first identified in the 1980s as a protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating and deactivating glycogen synthase in rabbit skeletal muscle. 1,2 Since then, GSK3 has been recognized as an evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase with a multitude of substrates. To date, over 100 substrates of GSK3 have been identified, with an additional 500 awaiting confirmation. 3,4 This extensive range of downstream regulated effects renders GSK3 one of the most functionally complex kinases involved in various cellular processes, including motility, metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. 3 The two isoforms of human GSK3, GSK3 α, and GSK3 β, consist of 483 amino acids (51 kDa) and 420 amino acids (47 kDa), respectively, as evidenced by research.5,6 These isoforms are derived from chromosome 19 and chromosome 3, respectively. 6,7 Both GSK3 α and GSK3 β have been detected in almost all species, with over 90% similarity across different species. 8 In Homo sapiens, the amino acid sequences of GSK3α and GSK3 β show 84%–85% similarity, while their kinase domains exhibit a high degree of homology, with 19 differential amino acids from the 285 amino acids that make up the kinase domains ( Figure 1A), according to sequence alignment. 6,7 Though hitherto no accurate structural information of GSK3α is obtained. Predicted result in UniProt (ht tps:// www. unipr ot. org/ unipr ot/ P49840# struc ture) suggests that the glycine- rich region distinguish between these two isoforms does not form a stable secondary structure. Hence, the secondary structures of GSK3 α and GSK3 β (Figure 1B) are also thought to be similar especially in kinase domains, which arrive at a conclusion that GSK3 α and GSK3β showed approximate biological activity. Nonetheless, research confirms that the glycine- rich region plays a role in localizing GSK3α inside the cell. 9 The wild- type GSK3 α is typically situated in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus, as stated in scholarly literature.7 Intriguingly, research indicates that truncated GSK3α lacking the N- terminal region congregates in the nucleus, with calcium stimulation further amplifying this effect. 10 In contrast, GSK3β displays greater nuclear mobility, particularly during the S- phase of the cell cycle and in the context of apoptosis, as reported in studies. 11,12 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that is typified by cognitive impairment and memory loss. It is the foremost cause of dementia, and while it remains a growing concern, the ever- increasing number of patients coupled with slow drug development has resulted in AD becoming a condition that is among the most destructive, expensive, and burdensome. 13,14 For instance, in the United States alone, it has been estimated that the cost of AD was approximately $305 billion in 2020, with around 5.8 million Americans affected. 15 In view of latest statistics, it can be anticipated that the figure of affected individuals is likely to rise to 13.8 million by 2050.15 While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil and excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists such as memantine remain the preferred treatment options for AD, it is worth noting that they have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for multiple decades and offer only partial relief of symptoms. 16,17 Recently, another drug called Aduhelm (aducanumab), which is a monoclonal antibody that targets A β (amyloid beta), has received FDA approval for treating AD.18 However, there is still ongoing debate regarding its curative effectiveness. 19 Despite exhaustive research, there exists an incomplete understanding of the fundamental mechanisms at play in AD. Supported by characteristic pathological markers including the aggregation of A β and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), these factors are believed to be the primary contributors to AD.13 Furthermore, observations of inflammation, 20 mitochondrial malfunction, oxidative stress, 21 autophagy impairment, 22 gut microbiota deregulation 23 and occurrences of ferroptosis 24 have all been documented in relation to the onset and progression of AD. Above all, AD is a highly intricate neurodegenerative disorder that requires ongoing exploration of therapeutic targets and drug development efforts. 13,14 High expression of GSK3 in the brain stands out as a significant phenomenon compared to its expression in other tissues. 6 This finding was first noticed in animal models at both mRNA and protein levels and subsequently mirrored in the human brain. 25,26 Given its considerable expression levels, the role of GSK3 in normal brain physiology and neurological conditions such as bipolar disorder, AD, Parkinson's disease, and psychiatric disorders has become increasingly intriguing to researchers. 7 Taking into account the multifunctional nature of GSK3 and its relevance to several pathological features of AD, notably the formation of NFTs,27,28 significant attention has been devoted to GSK3 in the course of developing drugs for AD.29 The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively explicate the link between GSK3 signaling and AD, and to summarize the latest advances in drug development for AD that specifically target GSK3. Ultimately, the intention is to supply relevant guidance on basic research on GSK3 signaling and to chart potential directions for creating AD drugs that specifically target GSK3.",836,3.pdf
11,GSK3: A potential target and pending issues for treatment of Alzheimer's disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.14818,result,"There is a wealth of evidence that supports a strong correlation between GSK3 and AD. Studies have shown that inhibiting the state of GSK3β, specifically p- GSK3βSer9, is beneficial for long- term memory formation.69 Through the identification of genes and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in hundreds of AD patients and healthy volunteers, it has been revealed that genetic variants of GSK3 β are closely associated with A β and p- tau.70 Moreover, high activity of GSK3β in the peripheral blood of AD patients has been found to be positively correlated with the severity of dementia. 71 Animal models have provided similar insights, as both the content and activity of GSK3β were observed to increase with age. 72–74 In a CamKIIα- tTA/GSK3β mouse model, where GSK3β was overexpressed starting at 6 months, neurodegeneration and other AD symptoms were observed at 12 months of age.75 Further mechanistic studies have revealed that the excessive activity of GSK3 influences the onset and progression of AD through various pathways. Impairment of the neuronal structure and function. Given the complex biological functions of GSK3 and its precise regulation, the dysregulation of GSK3, especially the excessive activation in AD patients or animal models, can have multiple negative effects on neurons ( Figure 2B). Researchers have activated GSK3 in model animals using different methods, and although the focus and specific indicators observed may vary, they have all discovered similar abnormalities in neuronal structural and functional processes. Abnormal neuronal proliferation and maturation processes, as well as resulting dendritic atrophy, have been found in CamKIIα- tTA/GSK3β mice. 76 Similarly, rats carrying the GSK3 β mutant with Ser9 mutated to Ala experience sustained activation of GSK3 β, leading to significant disruptions in neuronal oscillations in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal ventral side. 77 Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 β can promote neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice. 78 Specifically, GSK3 overexpression or excessive activation also damages substructures within neurons, such as synapses, dendrites, and axons. GSK3 β overexpression can inhibit synaptogenesis. 79 In rats with elevated GSK levels caused by exogenous or endogenous factors, the presynaptic active zone, postsynaptic density, and synaptic cleft are all negatively affected, accompanied by long- term potentiation (LTP) inhibition. 80 LTP inhibition and related synaptic damage are direct causes of memory impairment. 81–83 Excessive activation of GSK3 β in STZ- induced sporadic AD rats ultimately leads to decreased dendritic spine density and axonal thinning in the hippocampal CA1 region. 84 In AD mouse models exposed to Aβ oligomers, excessive GSK3 β activation is accompanied by dendritic spine loss.85 Axonal transport function is also severely impaired by GSK3 overactivation, leading to excessive accumulation of p- tau in the distal axon and impaired axonal transport of KIF1A (an essential protein for the delivery of neurotrophic factors), both contributing to the development of AD.86–89 In terms of mechanisms, based on the existing reports, the interaction between presenilin 1 (PS1) and GSK3 appears to be a crucial factor. PS1 serves as a significant biomarker of AD and has been demonstrated to be associated with the incidence of the disease, being utilized for establishing AD animal models through genetic mutations.90 Phosphorylation of PS1 by GSK3 β weakens its interaction with N- cadherin/β- catenin, resulting in the formation of trimeric complexes at synapses and a decrease in synaptic plasticity and neuronal vitality. 91 Mice with PS1 deficiency or mutations display increased GSK3 β activity, leading to notable axonal transport impairments. Mechanistically, GSK3β is involved in the augmented release of membrane- bound organelles driven by kinesin- I.92 Furthermore, excessive activation of GSK3 β increases the phosphorylation level of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), which hinders CRMP2 signal transduction and its regulation of axonogenesis and synaptic formation. 93,94 GSK3 is a critical participant in the β- catenin- dependent Wnt signaling pathway. 95 The pathway is known to have a significant impact on synaptic plasticity as well as memory. 96 The Wnt family is comprised of 19 lipid- modified glycoproteins and plays a crucial role in a range of cellular processes including cell metabolism, cell fate determination, polarity, and cytoskeleton alterations. The activation of the β- catenin- dependent Wnt signaling pathway involves the binding of Wnt to various cell surface receptors such as Frizzled (Fz), low- density lipoprotein receptor- related protein 5 (LRP5), and LRP6, ultimately triggering β - catenin to exert its biological effects. 95 GSK3 is a vital regulator of β - catenin degradation, and it forms a complex with casein kinase Iα (CKIα), Axin, and adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) to phosphorylate β - catenin. Subsequently, E3 polyubiquitin ligases recognize the phosphorylated β- catenin, and it is degraded by proteasome. Upon activation of Wnt signaling, the complex is eliminated, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized β - catenin, thus as a transcriptional coactivator that translocates to the nucleus to promote transcription of related genes. 95 Wnt- dependent protein degradation is a common occurrence in cells when GSK3 dysfunction manifests. GSK3's involvement in the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway aggravates AD- associated neuron damage.97 Following an evaluation of gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of both normal brains and AD patients, it was observed that the protein levels and activities of β- catenin and GSK3 β underwent a dynamic switch. These proteins are associated with Wnt signaling and suggest that such signaling is significantly impaired in AD patients.98 Further research has indicated that overexpression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf- 1 (Dkk- 1) in the hippocampus can lead to a reduction in learning and memory ability in mice. This effect was linked to synapse loss, LTP impairment, and long- term depression enhancement. However, the negative consequences were eliminated through associative inhibition of GSK3 and RhoA- Rock. Repression of Dkk- 1 expression displayed a similar effect.99 Overall, GSK3β plays a negative role in Wnt signaling- based neural functional recovery. Notably, activating muscarinic receptors inhibited GSK3 β and restarted the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway in A β1- 40- managed hippocampal neurons and glutamate- managed PC12 cells. This process helped protect neurons from serious damage. 100,101 Tau pathology. Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein that contains 85 phosphorylation sites, with over 50 of these sites having been identified as being phosphorylated. 102 The protein is predominantly expressed in neurons, where it exists in six primary isoforms. 103 The process of phosphorylation, a posttranslational modification, is essential for the biological function of tau, which tracks axonal microtubules and enhances their stability, thereby contributing to axonal growth and transportation. 104 However, hyperphosphorylated tau has been implicated in the formation of intracellular NFTs, a typical pathological characteristic of the brains of AD patients.105 Consequently, phosphorylated tau (p- tau) is recognized as a reliable biomarker for AD diagnosis and is also considered a promising target for AD treatment.106 GSK3 is a kinase of significant importance for p- tau, with approximately 30 serine or tyrosine residues from tau identified as potential phosphorylation sites for GSK3. 107 It has also been observed that GSK3's phosphorylation of tau is correlated with the formation of tangle- like filament morphology. 108 Importantly, recent studies illustrate that GSK3 β can directly acetylate the K15 site of tau protein, which has the negative consequence of inhibiting the ubiquitination degradation process and reducing its activity- inhibiting state (p- GSK3βser9), ultimately causing GSK3 β to become excessively activated.109 In essence, a detrimental cycle appears to have developed between tau pathology and GSK3 over- activation in the brains of AD patients. A meta- analysis conducted on studies related to AD involving the use of 3 ×Tg- AD mice found a positive correlation between Morris water maze (MWM) performance and p- tau levels. Additionally, p- GSK3βSer9 was identified as the primary contributor. 110 Further research involving GSK3 α deficiency mice suggested that GSK3 α also played a role in tau hyperphosphorylation. 111 AChE inhibitors, such as donepezil, remain the frontline treatment for AD, scientific investigators have discovered that in AD, AChE is colocalized with p- tau in neurofibrillary tangles. They have also found that GSK3 β- induced tau hyperphosphorylation suppressed the expression of AChE. Clinical studies involving the use of irreversible GSK3 β inhibitors have reported a 35 ± 16% increase in AChE activity among patients.112 Here we introduce the exacerbation of tau pathology by GSK3 signaling mediated by various biomacromolecules and micromolecules (Figure 3). PI3K/AKT- mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. The AKT enzyme is responsible for transferring the phosphate group to Ser21/9 of GSK3, thereby inhibiting excessive activation of GSK3 and maintaining the stability of p- tau. It has been established that AKT is initially phosphorylated and activated by phosphoinositide 3- kinase (PI3K).113 Therefore, it is widely believed that the PI3K/AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tau phosphorylation.6 Various upstream factors influencing PI3K or AKT may also partly affect tau phosphorylation through GSK3, which to some extent explains the interplay between neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and GSK3- mediated tau pathology. C- reactive protein, an immunomodulatory protein upregulated during inflammatory responses, induces tau phosphorylation in conjunction with alterations in AKT/GSK3 β.114 The excessive phosphorylation of tau induced by the inflammatory cytokine IL- 1β serves as a hallmark of the association between inflammation stimulation and tau pathology in AD. The phosphorylation capability of AKT on GSK3β is nullified by the sulfhydration of AKT at Cys77, which is contingent on elevated levels of intracellular hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) provoked by IL- 1β. This phenomenon leads to tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction. 115 Interestingly, a separate study demonstrated that exogenous administration of H 2S can directly sulfhydrate GSK3 β, resulting in decreased tau phosphorylation. 116 Thus, it is evident that high levels of H 2S have a dual impact on AKT/GSK3- mediated tau pathology. Therefore, in an inflammatory environment, whether AKT is cysteinylated or GSK3 is cysteinylated by H2S, which one takes precedence, is a thought- provoking question worthy of further exploration. The caspase family proteins, crucial proteases in cellular apoptosis, play essential roles in various biological processes in the nervous system. 117,118 Tau serves as a substrate for cysteine proteases, and caspase- cleaved tau has been detected in the AD brain but not in the normal brain. Importantly, caspase- cleaved tau exhibits higher fibrillogenicity compared to full- length tau. A combination of phosphorylation events and caspase activation contributes to the process of tau oligomerization in AD.119 GSK3β- mediated tau phosphorylation precedes caspase cleavage. Additionally, caspase- 3, a member of the caspase family, relieves the inhibition of GSK3 β by cleaving AKT, thereby increasing the occurrence of phosphorylation events. 119,120 Impairment of insulin signaling in the brain has been associated with AD. Overexpression of Regenerating islet- derived 1α (REG- 1α) in the brains of AD patients triggers tau phosphorylation through the AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway. 121 Mice with neuron- specific insulin receptor (NIR) KO exhibit activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway and significant tau pathology. 122 Overexpression of Phospholipid Transfer Protein (PLTP) in 3 ×Tg- AD mice alleviates various AD symptoms by limiting excessive activation of GSK3β and tau hyperphosphorylation through the PI3K/AKT pathway.123,124 Metabotropic Group I glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can influence PI3K/AKT, resulting in reduced GSK3β- mediated tau hyperphosphorylation. 125 The aforementioned proteins involve cellular signal transduction and intracellular and extracellular substance exchange. While a few studies have observed changes in their levels associated with alterations in the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway, this phenomenon is likely the result of multiple factors influencing it, such as insulin signaling, lipid transport, and metabolism. The underlying mechanisms by which these factors ultimately impact tau pathology through GSK3 β remain to be elucidated. A β- mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. The investigation of the correlation between A β and tau has been a consistent area of focus in research on AD.126 GSK3 serves as a crucial element in receiving stimulation from A β and promoting tau pathology.127 The research on the interaction between A β and tau, as well as the role of GSK3 within it, primarily revolves around the conformation of Aβ. Aβ1- 42 monomers, as opposed to oligomers, induce a PHF- like conformation of tau, resulting in multiple effects on tau, including phosphorylation, conformational changes, and degradation, while simultaneously elevating GSK3 levels. 128 It is worth noting that Aβ1- 42 oligomers can also promote GSK3- mediated tau pathology, with solubility being a crucial prerequisite. 129 A β1- 42 oligomers can bind with tau to form soluble stable complexes, enhancing the possibility of tau receiving phosphoryl groups from GSK3β.130 Additionally, A β1- 42 oligomers exhibit high affinity binding with GSK3 α, thereby promoting GSK3 α- catalyzed tau phosphorylation. 117 These findings confirm the interrelationship between A β, tau, and GSK3, although certain details still require further investigation. For instance, if A β can bind to both tau and GSK3 α, does that imply the formation of a complex involving all three proteins? Does the binding of Aβ to tau facilitate GSK3 β- mediated phosphorylation of tau, and does GSK3 β exhibit a similar strong interaction with A β as GSK3α does? In addition to directly binding to tau and promoting its phosphorylation by GSK3, the regulatory role of A β in GSK3 activity is equally significant. The indirect pathway of A β, mediated through norepinephrine α2A adrenergic receptor ( α2AAR) signaling, surpasses direct GSK3 β activation in terms of potency, 127 underscoring its crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. The cerebral neurons exhibit widespread distribution of α 2AAR, playing a pivotal role in transmitting norepinephrine signaling. 118 Aβ oligomers have the potential to bind to α 2AAR and induce conformational changes, redirecting norepinephrine signaling towards GSK3 β activation, thereby exacerbating tau hyperphosphorylation. 127 Moreover, Aβ also activates GSK3 and intensifies tau pathology through the promotion of adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) and double- stranded RNA- dependent protein kinase (PKR).131,132 Aβ also enhances the expression of E2F1 and c- Myb, which activate PAX6, a transcription factor linked to brain development and overexpressed in AD patients and animal models. PAX6 promotes GSK3β transcription and elevates the p- tau level at Ser356, Ser396, and Ser404. Besides, blocking PAX6 signaling partially mitigates Aβ- induced neuronal death. 133 Besides phosphorylation, A β also enhances tau accumulation via GSK3 β/SC35 signaling, which activates tau exon 10 splicing and increases intranuclear distribution. 134,135 The role of A β1- 42 in driving GSK3- mediated phosphorylation of p- tau has been extensively acknowledged. The non- amyloidogenic degradation pathway product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), known as sAPP α, exhibits a protective effect on AD pathophysiology by inhibiting GSK3 β and reducing tau phosphorylation, 136,137 suggesting that other intermediate products of APP processing merit further attention in relation to their association with GSK3. AMPK- mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. Recent studies have indicated that AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a crucial regulator of bioenergy metabolism and plays a significant role in AD.138 In various animal models of AD, low AMPK activity has been detected, while artificially increasing AMPK expression or activity has been found to ease tau hyperphosphorylation. Notably, GSK3 β agonists wortmannin have been found to limit the positive effects of AMPK on AD, emphasizing the pivotal role of GSK3β in AMPK- mediated suppression of p- tau.139 Moreover, research has revealed that memory impairment and tau hyperphosphorylation were observed in type- 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) KO mice with lower activity of AMPK alongside higher activity of GSK3β.139 In contrast, selective activation of CB2R was found to limit GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation; however, this protective effect was lost when AMPK was simultaneously inhibited.140 To summarize, the activation of AMPK inhibits GSK3β appears to be the primary mechanism by which CB2R mitigates tau pathology. Adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes, has been found to function as a euglycemic agent. 141 Long- term adiponectin deficiency has been associated with the induction of tau pathology and other AD pathologies.142 Mechanistically, adiponectin triggers AMPK phosphorylation, leading to the up- regulation of p- AKT and p- GSK3βSer9.142 Hence, adiponectin can effectively restrict tau hyperphosphorylation through the AMPK/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. However, it is noteworthy to mention that cerebral hypoglycemia has also been known to trigger tau pathology via the same signaling pathway, namely AMPK/AKT/GSK3β.143 GSK3 signaling mediated by other proteins in tau pathology. In addition to the above few signaling pathways or stimuli, there are numerous proteins that have been reported to directly or indirectly affect GSK3- mediated tau pathology. Firstly, there is a class of proteins that have been found to be abnormally expressed in AD patients or AD animal models, including Deficiency in G protein- coupled receptor- 5 (GRK5), Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), 3- β- Hydroxysteroid- Δ- 24- reductase (DHCR24), Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), Cystatin C, and beta- 2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs). Researchers have discovered the abnormality of GSK and p- tau during the investigation of their roles in AD. However, there is currently a lack of evidence to directly support their involvement through the modulation of GSK3 expression or activity. Therefore, further mechanistic research is still required as substantiating evidence. Deficiency in G protein- coupled receptor- 5 (GRK5) has been linked with mild cognitive impairment. 144 In GRK5 KO mice, overactivation of GSK3 β and tau hyperphosphorylation were observed, thus providing additional evidence of GRK5's inhibitory effect on GSK3β.145 Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) transgenic mice showed a striking pathological phosphorylation of tau, with upregulated p- GSK3βTyr216 and downregulated p- GSK3βSer9 indicating that GSK3 β was the immediate cause of p- tau.146 Increased expression of p44, a short isoform of p53, has been found to elevate the risk of tau pathology.147 Moreover, haploinsufficiency for p73, a member of the p53 family, has demonstrated a similar phenomenon. 148 Several kinases, among them GSK3 β, have been implicated in p44/p73- related tau pathology. 3- β- Hydroxysteroid- Δ- 24- reductase (DHCR24), an enzyme that converts desmosterol to cholesterol, has been found to be down- regulated in individuals with AD.149 Its levels are closely associated with caveolin- 1, an intrinsic membrane protein that is responsible for structuring caveolae leading to a key role in PP2A phosphorylation site localization. DHCR24 has been shown to promote the activity of PP2A, resulting in increased levels of p- GSK3βTyr216 and p- tau.150 Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a “longevity gene” that optimizes energy homeostasis, is underexpressed in aging- related diseases such as AD.151 SIRT6 KO mice have exhibited significant AD- like symptoms and tau hyperphosphorylation caused by GSK3 activation.152 In patients with AD, the continuous overexpression of the regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) has been observed to result in the downregulation of Calcineurin, an essential phosphatase that catalyzes tau dephosphorylation. Furthermore, RCAN1 has been found to induce GSK3 β- catalyzed tau hyperphosphorylation. 153 Cystatin C has also been observed to be upregulated in the brains of both AD patients and model animals, and its overexpression in neurons has been shown to accelerate tau phosphorylation by impeding the turnover of GSK3 β.154 A similar increase in beta- 2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) has also been observed, and their stimulation has been found to influence GSK3 β and Cyclin- dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in contributing to tau pathology. 155,156 Another major category of proteins, known as receptors, have the ability to perceive incoming signals and regulate cellular functions in response to signal stimulation. Several types of receptors have been reported, and their activation or inhibition ultimately influences GSK3- mediated tau hyperphosphorylation. The observation was made that the activation of M1 receptors in 3×Tg- AD mice led to a decrease in GSK3β activity and p- tau levels. It was also noted that administration of an M1 antagonist noticeably aggravated the pathologic phosphorylation of tau. 157 Based on these findings, M1 receptors were believed to play a critical role in the regulation of GSK3β and p- tau. Furthermore, the Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) was found to be involved in the regulation of calcium channels, which, when activated, could mitigate tau hyperphosphorylation via GSK3 β,158 while the inhibition of the histamine H3 receptor was shown to relieve GSK3 β- related pathologic phosphorylation of tau. 159 Complement C3 receptor has been reported to promote GSK3 β activity, while its inhibition has been proven to alleviate tau hyperphosphorylation catalyzed by GSK3 β.160 The nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) is recognized for its positive impact on synaptic plasticity and memory formation.161 Nonetheless, excessive expression of NR4A1 may activate GSK3β which can subsequently result in tau hyperphosphorylation.162 Chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) is a well- established inflammation marker that undergoes upregulation, and CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) is the receptor for CCL11 found in hippocampal neurons.163,164 CCR3/CCL11 has been associated with elevated p- tau levels, and GSK3 β plays a partial role in this mechanism. 164 Other proteins that influence GSK3- mediated tau pathology exert their effects through mechanisms that primarily involve direct binding to GSK3 or affecting the interaction between GSK3 and tau, as well as directly impacting the phosphorylation activation of GSK3, and so on. Studies have suggested that both GSK3 β and tau bind to the same region of PS1, thereby promoting the enzymatic effects of GSK3 β in phosphorylating its substrate, tau. 165 Furthermore, the key tau kinase, CDK5, is generally activated by the protein p35. However, the p35 calpain cleavage product, p25, has a higher preference for binding to and activating GSK3 β compared to CDK5, which leads to the phenomenon of p- tau enhancement. 156,166 Nedd8 ultimate buster 1 (NUB1) is a protein that is induced by interferon and is known to accelerate the clearance of proteins eliminated by the ubiquitin- proteasome system.167 Research indicates that NUB1 has multiple functions in regulating tau pathology, including the aggregation and phosphorylation of tau. Importantly, NUB1 promotes the degradation of GSK3 β and also impedes the interaction between GSK3β and tau. 168 Axin restricts the interaction between GSK3 β and tau, which prevents GSK3 β from pathologically phosphorylating tau.169 The programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) has established prominence in cancer therapy.170 Recent studies unearthed a PDL1- GSK3β immune complex within the brains of APP/PS1 and 5×FAD mice, an entity that heightens GSK3β activity and p- tau levels.171 The preceding paragraph has indicated the potential of ILK to augment the inhibitory effects on GSK3. 7 In N1E- 115 neuroblastoma cells, inactivation of ILK led to the loss of its inhibitory effect on GSK3β, which subsequently caused an elevation in p- tau levels. 172 The previous paragraph has also explained the role of GSK3 in the Wnt/β- catenin pathway. In aged rats, inhibited Wnt signaling by Dkk- 1 decreased PP2A activity and increased GSK3β activity, which resulted in excessive tau phosphorylation at multiple sites in the hippocampus. 173 Pin 1 is a promising target for cancer therapy. 174 However, the inhibition of Pin1 in AD amplifies GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation. 175 It has also been reported that GSK3β affects the proportions of different isoforms of tau mRNA through alternative splicing. Prion protein PrPC serves as an upstream regulator that inhibits GSK3 β activation. 176 Furthermore, interferon- gamma (IFN- γ) initiates cellular immunity and triggers tau hyperphosphorylation via GSK3β signaling. 177 MiRNA- mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. In brain tissues of AD patients, there is a reduced content of miR- 219- 5p, which has a negative correlation with both GSK3 β and tau- tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1). 178 The 3 ′ untranslated region of GSK3 β mRNA and TTBK1 mRNA share a base sequence of 5′- GACAAUC- 3′, which can bind with miR- 219- 5p, thereby inhibiting the expressions of GSK3 β (instead of the phosphorylation of GSK3 β) and TTBK1, as well as the hyperphosphorylation of tau. 178 The most significant miRNA decrease observed in AD patients' neurons is miR- 132,179,180 whose down- regulation is closely linked to the pathological processes of AD, such as the formation of NFTs.181 Mechanistically, miR- 132 can regulate the expression and various post- translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, and limit the phosphorylation of tau through its negative role in both the transcription and translation of GSK3 β.179 The phenomenon of decreased miR- 23b- 3p has been observed in the plasma of AD patients, cortex of APP/PS1 mice, brain of SAMP8 mice, and SH- SY5Y/APPswe cells. Delivery of miR- 23b- 3p into the ventricles of APP/PS1 mouse brains can improve their cognitive deficits, alleviate AD pathology, and especially reduce tau phosphorylation at multiple sites. Mechanistic studies indicate that miR- 23b- 3p mainly exerts its effects by reducing the levels and activity of GSK3 β.182 Moreover, the LncRNA nuclear paraspeckles assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) facilitates the transcription of frizzled class receptor 3 (FCR3), thus limiting the phosphorylation of tau by GSK3 β.183 Micromolecules and other stimulus mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. Inducers of disease models, environmental pollutants, and certain physical factors like noise pollution are all significant contributors to tau pathology that cannot be overlooked. The link between AD and diabetes is widely recognized, with GSK3 playing a crucial role. 7,184 Glucocorticoids, the key hormone responsible for raising blood glucose levels, have also been reported to activate GSK3 β, elevate p- tau levels, and impair memory in db/db mice. 185 As an inducer of sporadic AD models, STZ is frequently used in the modeling of both AD and diabetes mellitus.186 Experiments have shown that STZ can stimulate tau hyperphosphorylation through the PI3K/AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway. 186,187 Rotenone, a renowned compound extracted from Derris known for its ability to induce apoptosis, is also frequently employed in the establishment of PD models, has been demonstrated to elevate p- tau levels through the activation of GSK3β.188 Methamphetamine abuse often leads to dementia, and experimental evidence has shown that methamphetamine contributes to tau hyperphosphorylation through the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway.189 Cypermethrin, a pesticide, can up- regulate GSK3 β. Initially, cypermethrin blocks the heparin- binding epidermal growth factor (HB- EGF) signaling pathway, which results in neuroinflammation. The excessive generation of IL- 1 ultimately increases the levels of GSK3β and p- tau.190 Furthermore, 3- Nitropropionic acid triggers the mitochondrial origin of oxidative stress, while excessive activation of GSK3β and tau hyperphosphorylation were also observed in the hippocampus and cortex of mice exposed to 3- nitropropionic acid. 191 Prolonged exposure to arsenic can elevate GSK3 β activity and exacerbate tau hyperphosphorylation in SH- SY5Y cells, while multiple GSK3β inhibitors can alleviate the effects of arsenic. 192 Plumbum exposure can also lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, with the activation of GSK3 β and CDK5 being the declared pathogenesis.193 Furthermore, iron accumulation can increase the activities of GSK3 β and CDK5, thereby worsening tau pathology.194 Paricalcitol can alleviate iron accumulation by activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR), thus down- regulating p- GSK3βTyr216 and ultimately preventing hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser396 and Thr181 sites. 195 Intranasal administration of deferoxamine produces similar effects on GSK3 β and tau. 194 Chronic noise exposure has also been linked to tau pathology, with PP2A/GSK3 β being under- regulated.196 Interestingly, B- vitamin deficiency has been found to exhibit a similar function as noise.197 Moreover, stress responses such as electric shocks and ether anesthesia can exacerbate the pathologic phosphorylation of tau via GSK3β.198,199 These studies suggest the crucial significance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in preventing the occurrence and progression of AD symptoms. It is also advisable for AD patients to eliminate or minimize negative neurostimulants such as environmental pollutants and drugs while undergoing treatment. Nevertheless, further research is still required to substantiate the direct association between these stimulating factors and GSK3- mediated tau pathology. This is because, based on existing research, their impact on the nervous system is intricate and potentially irreversible, with GSK3- mediated tau pathology likely representing just one of the most overt pathological outcomes. Amyloid pathology. Just like GSK3 is associated with other typical pathological features, amyloid pathology is also known to be linked with it. This pathology occurs due to an accumulation of A β, which is cleaved from its precursor protein APP. APP is an integral membrane protein that is abundantly expressed in the synapses of neurons and plays vital roles in synapse formation and repair, anterograde neuronal transport, and iron export. 200 There are three isoforms of APP that mainly concentrate in different tissues or cells. These isoforms are named APP 695, APP751, and APP770, based on the number of amino acid residues. The shortest isoform, APP 695, lacks a Kunitz- type protease inhibitor sequence in the ectodomain and is the most abundant in brains and neurons. 200,201 However, APP 751 and APP770 are expressed more abundantly in platelets and peripheral cells. 200 It should be noted that not all cleavage processes of APP lead to the production of A β. Depending on whether or not Aβ is produced, cleavage processes can be classified into non- amyloidogenic pathways and amyloidogenic pathways. Figure 4 shows that in the non- amyloidogenic pathway, APP is firstly cleaved by α- secretase to form sAPPα and α- C terminal fragment (CTF α).200 Unlike Aβ, sAPPα plays crucial roles in neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity related learning and memory, 136 and it is produced more along with increased neuronal activity. 202 CTF α can be further cleaved to P3 and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), catalyzed by γ- secretase.200 The amyloidogenic pathway, on the other hand, involves β - secretase instead of α- secretase. In this pathway, APP is initially cleaved by α- secretase to form soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPP β) and β- C terminal fragment (CTF β). The γ - secretase also catalyzes CTF β cleavage, leading to the generation of AICD. However, under further processing by γ- secretase at multiple sites, 40 amino acid A β1- 40 and the 42 amino- acid A β1- 42 are ultimately generated. 200 These highly neurotoxic peptide fragments are the inducers of amyloid pathology. Therefore, it is significant to reduce A β generation by suppressing β- secretase and γ- secretase activities. Additionally, activating α - secretase could be helpful. GSK3β is involved in various stages of Aβ formation, both directly and indirectly. These stages include its impact on APP expression, phosphorylation, lysosomal degradation, as well as its influence on α- secretase, β- secretase, and γ- secretase (Figure 4). The association between GSK3 activation and A β pathology has been observed in numerous cellular or animal models. CDK5 knockdown in 3×Tg- AD mice executed at the age of 15 months, showed significant reduction in amyloid plaques. The activation of GSK3 β and PP2A was declared to be the primary reason. 203 The author of this report primarily focuses on the association between CDK5 and GSK3β. Unfortunately, the direct cause of GSK3 β activation leading to the formation of amyloid plaques in this one of the most classic AD animal models has not been thoroughly investigated. Nevertheless, GSK3 β siRNA was employed to knockdown GSK3 β in STZ- induced, in vitro and in vivo models of AD. The remarkable outcomes were overcome down- regulation of A β in cell models and mitigation of A β accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus of animal models. Inhibition of APP and β- secretase 1 (BACE1) by GSK3 β siRNA was found to be the crucial factor contributing to this phenomenon. 204 Conversely, inhibition of β- secretase was observed to stimulate GSK3 β and intensify tau hyperphosphorylation. 205 Senescence- accelerated prone mouse strain 8 (SAMP8) mouse model is a form of rapid aging animal models associated with cognitive impairment. In SAMP8 mice, the modification of the PI3K/AKT pathway gradually activated GSK3β with age. Ultimately, both β- secretase and γ- secretase were activated, leading to an increase in the levels of A β1- 40 and A β1- 42 in platelet and hippocampi. 206 Hence, the impact on β - secretase and γ- secretase appears to be crucial in linking GSK3 with A β pathology, and several literature reports provide strong evidence supporting this inference. As a kinase of glycogen synthase, the over- activation of GSK3 is one of the causes of glucose metabolism disorder leading to diabetes. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are toxic substances generated in the body after long- term hyperglycemia. 7 Receptor for AGEs (RAGE) had been established to contribute to amyloid pathology. GSK3β and p38 were identified as the connecting links between RAGE signal and A β. Gene silencing of RAGE curtailed GSK3 β and ameliorated A β accumulation, accompanied by attenuated activities of β- secretase and γ- secretase.207 Through the association of T- cell factor- 4 with the BACE1 promoter, the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway could impede BACE1 transcription. It must be noted that the GSK3 inhibitor propelled Wnt signaling and concurrently repressed BACE1 transcription. 208 The transcriptional expression, phosphorylation, and degradation processes of APP also exert an influence on the ultimate accumulation of A β, wherein GSK plays a significant role. When comparing gene expression between normal people, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and AD patients, GSK3β expression was positively linked to the expression of Amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 2, 209 a transcription activator of APP. 210 In an inflammatory milieu, astrocytes have the potential to transmit CK1 to neurons via extracellular vesicles, which finally exacerbates the formation of amyloid plaques, where GSK3 has a definitive function. More specifically, in response to the stimulation of IL- 1β, astrocytes secrete extracellular vesicles that envelop CK1. Then, after the transfer of CK1 to neurons, it engages in a complex with APC and GSK3, which obstructs the degradation of β - catenin. Consequently, this escalates the level of APP mRNA and in turn, intensifies the co- localization of BACE1 and APP. In essence, GSK3 is instrumental in regulating APP expression and amyloid processing through this pathway.211 Suppressing GSK3 β also diminished APP phosphorylation,212 which might change the APP cleavage process and stop Aβ production. 213 Besides, restraining GSK3 fostered the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor EB, thereby enhancing the number of lysosomes, which ultimately improved APP autophagic degradation, consequently curtailing A β level.214 Apart from curbing Aβ accumulation, GSK3 β also influenced the sensitivity of the hippocampus towards A β. It was found that the voluntary running of mice prevented their hippocampal network from disturbance caused by Aβ, and this defense was dependent on the inhibition of GSK3 β.215 Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Efforts have been made in recent decades to alleviate amyloid pathology and tau pathology in AD, but drug development progress has been slow.216 Therefore, researchers have also shown great interest in other pathogenesis, such as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in AD. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis are common phenomena observed in AD patients or animal models, thus characterizing oxidative stress. 21 Inflammation, as indicated by the high levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF- α, IL- 6, and others found in AD patients' serum and brain, has also been linked to AD. The alteration of immune cells, such as reactive astrocytes, T cells, and particularly activated microglia in the brain of AD patients, explains the occurrence of inflammation at the cellular level. The role of GSK3 in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation has been implicated in its known substrate nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor 2 (Nrf2), a significant transcription factor that responds to environmental stimuli, particularly elevated ROS.218 Nrf2 transfers from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to perform its biological functions. The dimerization of the transcriptional co- activator sMaf stabilizes Nrf2 in the nucleus, allowing it to interact with Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) to enhance transcription of various genes ( Figure 5), such as heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), etc.219 As a sophisticated regulator, the content of Nrf2, particularly the content in the nucleus, is tightly controlled by the ubiquitination system. Kelch- like ECH- associated protein 1 (Keap1) functions to concatenate Nrf2 and Cul3- Rbx1, a ubiquitin ligase complex, ultimately leading to ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2.220 However, Keap1 is not the only ubiquitination process involved in Nrf2 degradation. As shown in the Figure 5, another ubiquitin ligase complex, β- TrCP- Cul1, is also responsible for Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation. Crucially, when p- GSK3βY216 phosphorylates Nrf2, it greatly promotes the negative regulatory process of Nrf2. 218 Therefore, suppressing GSK3 β is considered a promising therapeutic strategy for AD due to its Nrf2 activation effect. For example, an antisense oligonucleotide of GSK3β that reduced the level of GSK3β in the cortex of SAMP8 mice also exhibited Nrf2 activation and improved learning and memory abilities.221 GSK3 has also been found to be involved in the muscarinic M1 receptor- induced Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus. Overexpression of the M1 receptor in PC12 cells enhanced the level of Nrf2, activated the antioxidant response element (ARE), and facilitated the transcription and translation of HO- 1. GSK3β(Δ9) nullified the Nrf2- regulated oxidation while GSK3β(Y216F) had little to no effect on it.222 The activity of Nrf2 is closely linked with inflammation, largely due to its crosstalk with NF- κB, a well- known regulator of inflammation.223 As shown in Figure 5, excessive production of ROS would facilitate multiple steps of NF- κB activation, which also relies on upstream regulatory factor IKKα ubiquitination and degradation. 223 Although there is currently no evidence of GSK3 involvement in IKKα ubiquitination, the collective suppression of GSK3 β and NF- κB has been observed in some cells and animal models. 224,225 For instance, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a promising target for inflammatory and AD treatment.226 Inhibiting sEH in Aβ1- 42 induced AD mice was found to stabilize epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, a series of compounds with anti- inflammatory properties. Interestingly, a high level of p- GSK3βSer9, accompanied by Nrf2 activation and NF- κB inhibition, was also observed. 227 From the perspective of signaling pathways, the Nrf2 and NF- κB signaling pathways are crucial for the neuroinflammation caused by excessive activation of GSK3. Meanwhile, from the perspective of neural cells, both microglia and astrocyte activation have been found to be associated with GSK3. Microglia, which are resident immune cells in the brain, release a large amount of inflammatory factors after M1 polarization in pathological conditions. Similarly, activated astrocytes can also release inflammatory factors and chemokines to attract microglia into the damaged area. A β1- 42 induces neuronal apoptosis and releases phosphatidylserine, thereby activating microglia and promoting neuroinflammation. The GSK3/Wnt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in this process, inhibiting PI3K/AKT to activate GSK3β and facilitate microglial activation. 228 A low level of DHCR24 was accompanied by GSK3β activation and hyperphosphorylation of tau.149,150 In addition to tau pathology, overexpression of DHCR24 in BV- 2 cells reversed the microglia polarization trend induced by A β25- 35. Increased levels of arginase- 1, IL- 4, and TGF- β, and decreased levels of iNOS, IL- 1β, and TNF- α reflected that DHCR24 promoted M2 polarization of microglia, playing an anti- inflammatory role. The key mechanism is the activation of AKT and thereby the inhibition of GSK3 β.229 GSK3β is also involved in microglial activation via phosphorylation of astrocyte CCAAT enhancer- binding protein delta (CEBPD), a well- known participant in inflammation- related diseases. 230 In astrocytes of AD patients, excessive activation of the calcium- activated potassium channel KCa3.1 was observed. In LPS- induced neuroinflammation mice, the KO of KCa3.1 protected neurons and alleviated cognitive impairment. KCa3.1 deficiency mice showed activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, suppression of GSK3 β, and inhibition of NF- κB signaling.231 Moreover, in vitro cultures of various glial cells extracted from rat cortex released various inflammatory factors including IL- 1β, TNF- α, and IL- 10, which were significantly decreased by different GSK3 inhibitors.232 Mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria serve as the primary sites for cellular energy metabolism. The brain, being the most metabolically active organ, relies on the abundant ATP produced through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In the brain of AD patients, noticeable alterations occur in both the structure and function of mitochondria, including changes in glucose and oxygen metabolism due to respiratory chain dysfunction, as well as accumulation of ROS and mutations in mitochondrial DNA.233 Under oxidative stress conditions, GSK3β translocates from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria in a kinase activity and voltage- dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2)- dependent manner. This process is associated with increased cell death and can be blocked by GSK3 β inhibitors.234 Studies have demonstrated that GSK3 β inhibition can enhance mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, while altering NAD(P)H metabolism. These metabolic effects are associated with the increased stability of PGC- 1α protein, enhanced nuclear localization, and increased co- transcriptional activation. This suggests that the GSK3β/PGC- 1α axis may play an important role in maintaining neuronal metabolic integrity.235 Dynamin- related protein 1 (Drp1) is a key protein involved in mitochondrial division and is highly expressed in neuronal cells. Research has shown that GSK3 β can induce the phosphorylation of Drp1, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation and increased neuronal sensitivity to A β toxicity. In vivo and in vitro models have shown that limiting the phosphorylation of Drp1 induced by GSK3β is an effective way to protect the nervous system from A β damage.236 Axonal transport defects caused by A β result in impaired mitochondrial transport, leading to acute impairments in mitochondrial trafficking in A β- stimulated hippocampal neurons. Researchers have found that the activation of GSK3 β by A β is a significant contributor to mitochondrial transport dysfunction.237 Another study has revealed that GSK3β can co- localize with and regulate HDAC6 phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons. HDAC6 regulates tubulin acetylation and affects the function of the motor protein- 1, playing a crucial role in the anterograde transport of mitochondria within axons. Serotonin, a neuromodulator, can enhance mitochondrial transport through AKT- mediated inhibition of GSK3 β, indicating that GSK3 β may interfere with mitochondrial transport by affecting HDAC6 activity.238 Autophagy impairment. Autophagy is a cellular catabolic process responsible for breaking down damaged organelles and protein aggregates through the lysosomal pathway. It helps to clear out Aβ and p- tau.22 The mTOR, which is regulated by GSK3, plays a crucial role in promoting autophagy, thereby mitigating the pathological effects of A β and p- tau.239 In the previous chapter, the relationship between the low expression of DHCR24 and the pathogenesis of AD, specifically tau hyperphosphorylation and microglia M1 polarization was presented. DHCR24 knockdown resulted in overactivation of GSK3β, which is a significant molecular mechanism. Additionally, DHCR24 knockdown SH- SY5Y cells showed autophagy inhibition characterized by decreased autophagosome. Mechanistically, the activated GSK3β phosphorylates mTOR at Ser2448, stimulating it to act as an autophagy inhibitor. 240 PS1 KO human neural stem cells also displayed GSK3β related autophagy suppression. 241 Therapeutic strategies for AD targeting GSK3. As previously stated, the excessive activation of GSK3 in AD patients is closely related to tau phosphorylation, A β pathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress damage, and other factors contributing to AD. Therefore, targeting GSK3 has been a major focus of AD treatment strategies. In this section, we will systematically summarize preclinical experiments that have exhibited GSK3 inhibition and AD therapeutic effects, including newly developed GSK3- targeting compounds, natural products discovered from traditional herbal medicine, and clinically approved drugs ( Figure 6). Meanwhile, we also present an overview of other therapeutic approaches that can impinge upon the activity of GSK3 ( Figure 6). Chemically synthesized targeted therapeutics. Using chemical synthesis to obtain compounds targeting the desired protein such as GSK3 has always been a direct and effective method. 242,243 This article summarizes more than 10 new GSK3- targeting compounds, which have shown certain efficacy in AD model animals. Their chemical structures and biological functions are summarized in Table 1. Compound 47 is an imidazo[1,2- b]pyridazine that exhibits remarkable GSK3β and p- tau inhibition activities, with an IC50 of 0.37 nM and 58 nM for GSK3β and p- tau inhibition, respectively. 245 As a designed GSK3 β inhibitor, compound 10a has shown comprehensive anti- AD effects in AlCl3 combined with D- galactose induced AD mice, including improved cognitive ability, reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, and lowered hippocampal neuronal damage, among others. 246 In addition to the aforementioned compound designs that target GSK3 β alone, many pharmaceutical chemists have shifted their focus towards the design of AD drugs targeting multiple targets, including GSK3 β. Compound 11c is a dual inhibitor designed based on GSK3 β and AchE, which has shown objective recovery of learning and memory ability in scopolamine- or Aβ1- 42- induced AD mice. The neuroprotective effects of Compound 11c include inhibiting brain tau phosphorylation and increasing acetylcholine and serotonin levels in the brain. 247 Another GSK3β, AchE dual inhibitor Compound GT15 can reduce tau phosphorylation induced by okadaic acid and ROS induced by LPS in vitro. In in vivo experiments, GT15 can also enhance the learning and memory ability of AD mice.250 Compound LDC8 is a dual inhibitor of GSK3β and CDK5, which can alleviate neuronal inflammation damage. In the zebrafish model induced by A β1- 42, LDC8 therapy increased synaptic density by 67.6%.249 Compound 2 is a synthetic BACE1/GSK3 β dual inhibitor, which exhibits good inhibitory effects on A β formation, alleviating inflammation damage, and promoting neurogenesis. 251 Regrettably, there is currently limited research on PROTAC targeting GSK3, as well as scarce reports on chemical drug designs focusing on GSKα. PROTAC, which enables targeted compound ubiquitination degradation, represents a novel and promising strategy in drug design. And compounds targeting GSK α provide an alternative option for inhibiting GSK3 in the treatment of AD. Compound PT- 65 is a PROTAC, which has strong affinity for both GSK3α and GSK3 β. By degradation of GSK3, PT- 65 can inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation and protect against cognitive impairments. 253 Compound 1 is a recently reported rare inhibitor specifically designed for GSK3 α. This compound and its derivatives designed based on it exhibit a selectivity for GSK3 α that is significantly higher than that for GSK3 β, up to 37 times higher. In addition, Compound 1 has also demonstrated good activity in inhibiting tau phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo.244 Natural products. Searching for drugs or lead compounds from natural products has always been an important avenue for drug development. Many researchers have also attempted to identify natural products with therapeutic potential for AD and elucidate their mechanisms, based on the long- term experience of using traditional Chinese medicine or herbal remedies. The involvement of GSK3 in various pathological aspects of AD is evident. It is apparent that these natural compounds exert their effects on GSK3, thereby protecting neurons, alleviating tau pathology, reducing neuroinflammation, and mitigating oxidative stress damage. By stimulating PI3K/AKT, selenomethionine effectively suppressed GSK3 β and triggered Wnt signaling in the hippocampus. This resulted in a significant increase in the number of differentiated neurons from neural stem cells, coupled with an obvious decrease in astrocytes. 255 In separate studies, 20(S)- protopanaxadiol and oleanolic acid improved the learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice by inhibiting GSK3 β and activating Wnt/ β- catenin in the hippocampus, ultimately enhancing neurogenesis. 256 Similarly, icarisid II exerted a similar molecular mechanism and promoted the proliferation of neural stem cells and neuronal differentiation, leading to considerable neurogenic benefits. 257,258 Morin is a natural flavonoid that impacts tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting GSK3 β, as suggested by both the crystal structure of complex (PDB: 1H8F) and surface plasmon resonance result.259 Moreover, it has been observed that morin binds to the ATP binding pocket of GSK3 β with a 67 μM dissociation constant value.260 Ginsenoside Rg1 has shown significant efficacy in various animal models of dementia, such as OKA- induced AD rats, aluminum chloride- induced AD mice and Squirrel monkeys.261–263 Although the detailed mechanisms revealed in different reports are not completely the same, Ginsenoside Rg1 is believed to inhibit GSK3 activity in all cases. For instance, in the AD mouse model, the inhibition of GSK3 by Ginsenoside Rg1 is accompanied by a decrease in the level of PP2A. In the Squirrel monkey model, the author suggests that the Wnt/GSK- 3β/β- catenin pathway is the main signal pathway under regulation, and that neurocyte apoptosis, oxidative stress damage and inflammatory reactions are all inhibited. 261–263 Along similar molecular mechanism, ginsenoside Rd significantly attenuated tau pathology. 264 Lignans obtained from Schisandra chinensis Turcz. (Baill.) have a novel dibenzocyclooctadiene skeletal structure and considerable biological activities. 223 Among them, schisandrin B and schisantherin B exhibited substantial potential in alleviating tau pathology, and their roles in inhibiting GSK3 β were also identified. 265,266 Furthermore, several other natural products including paeoniflorin, 267 genistein, 231 berberine, 268 isobavachalcone,269 moscatilin, 270 xanthohumol, 271 resveratrol, 272 fisetin, 273 C- glycosylflavones,274 geniposide, 275–277 ginkgolide A, 278 caffeic acid,279 asiatic acid, 280 ellagic acid, 281 etc., also played crucial roles in inhibiting GSK3 and mitigating tau hyperphosphorylation, and the specific molecular mechanisms were illustrated in Figure 3. Certain natural compounds have demonstrated favorable anti- inflammatory and antioxidant activities in both in vivo and in vitro models of AD. Oxyphylla A effectively suppressed high ROS levels in N2a/APP cells, enhanced the learning and memory abilities of SAMP8 mice, and mitigated oxidative stress damage. Its effect on the GSK3 β/Nrf2 pathway was identified as the key underlying molecular mechanism, whereby oxyphylla A triggered AKT phosphorylation, leading to the inactivation of GSK3 β and ultimately activating Nrf2. 282 Similarly, thymol and artemether, two other natural products also activated Nrf2, albeit through different pathways. Thymol achieved GSK3 β/Nrf2 activation via AKT, while artemether acted via AMPK.283,284 Eupatin is a natural substance that has the ability to bind with GSK3 β and hinder its activity. In mouse microglia cells and macrophages that were treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), eupatin was observed to diminish both the overall content as well as the level of p65 phosphorylation. 224 Anthocyanins were also investigated for their effects on LPS- induced neuroinflammation mice. It was discovered that, besides regulating AKT, GSK3 β, and NF- κB, anthocyanins were able to decrease ROS in the hippocampus of these mice.285 Additionally, another study reported that in APP/PS1 mice, anthocyanins exhibited antioxidant abilities through the GSK3 β/Nrf2 pathway. 286 Neuroprotectin D1 is a pro- resolving mediator produced from docosahexaenoic acid in neuronal cells. In N2a/APPswe cells, neuroprotectin D1 inhibited GSK3β and led to enhanced autophagy with decreased expression of beclin 1. 287 Amentoflavone has been found to inhibit A β1- 42- induced neuronal apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo studies have shown that Amentoflavone can increase neuronal activity in the hippocampal region of AD rats and alleviate cognitive impairment at an epigenetic level. In vitro experiments using SH- SY5Y cells with AMPKα knockdown demonstrated the importance of AMPK in the biological functions of Amentoflavone. Mechanistically, amentoflavone acting via the AMPK pathway inhibits GSK3β and exerts anti- apoptotic and anti- AD effects.288 Meridianins are indole alkaloids isolated from marine ascidians, which display remarkable cognitive improvement in 5 ×FAD mice by inhibiting GSK3β and rescuing synaptic loss as well as suppressing neuroinflammation. 289 As mentioned in paragraph 4 of Section 3.3 , GSK3 β is also involved in glucose metabolism, and AGEs are formed after chronic hyperglycemia. 7,290 AGEs increased GSK3 β activity and tau phosphorylation in female APP/PS1 mice. Treatment with trehalose mitigated the negative effect of AGEs through down- regulation of GSK3β and triggered nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). 291 Similarly, Calycosin exhibits a neuroprotective effect against AGEs- induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting GSK3 β. In a rat model of diabetes complicated with AD, Calycosin improves learning and memory, and reduces AD- related pathologies such as neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. 292 Finally, other natural products such as galangin, 293 naringenin, 294 wogonin,295 curcumin, 296 and linarin 297 have exhibited certain GSK3 inhibitory activity and neuroprotective effects related to AD in vitro. However, these effects have not yet been validated by in vivo experiments. Marketed drugs. The secondary development of clinical drugs is an important aspect that cannot be ignored, with aspirin being the classic success story in this regard. Hence, many drugs already on the market have been investigated for their potential to relieve AD pathology related to GSK3 β. The antidepressant fluoxetine inhibited GSK3 β activity through PP2A, thereby activating the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway. As a result, 3×Tg- AD mice treated with fluoxetine exhibited reduced neuronal apoptosis, synaptic damage, and A β accumulation. 298 Sodium selenate also activated the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway via PP2A and GSK3β and effectively alleviated the symptoms of 3 ×Tg- AD mice.299 Rapamycin is a well- known mTOR inhibitor and autophagy inducer with proven efficacy in clearing toxic proteins such as A β and p- tau. Researchers have found that Rapamycin can increase Wnt3a expression, resulting in GSK3 β inhibition and increased β- catenin, thereby improving AD pathology.300 Lithium is a recognized inhibitor of GSK3 and is one of the most widely used mood stabilizers for the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. It has also been attempted to treat various GSK3- related diseases. 2,301 The relationship between lithium and GSK3, as well as its role in AD, have also been reported. For instance, lithium can dose- dependently reduce the mRNA levels of GSK3 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal neurons of rats, and its inhibition of GSK3β can promote AchE degradation by proteasomes and activate cholineacetyltransferase. In animal models of AD, Lithium has also been demonstrated to alleviate scopolamine- induced memory impairment. 302,303 LiCl also improved the level of Nrf2 in APP/PS1 mice, upregulated the levels of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and GSH- Px, downregulated the level of lipid peroxidation product MDA in both brains and serum, further indicating the antioxidative effects of LiCl via the GSK3 β/Nrf2 pathway. 304 A retrospective cohort study identified a correlation between the usage of lithium and a reduced risk of developing dementia. This clinical evidence validates the role of lithium and further supports the potential of GSK3 as a therapeutic target for AD.305 Melatonin, an amine hormone produced by the pineal gland, has gained recognition for its hypnotic effects, although it is currently only approved as a drug in some countries. Melatonin can inhibit GSK3β through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and exert a series of anti- AD effects such as inhibiting p- tau.306 The GSK3 β inhibition effect of melatonin can also lead to the downregulation of ADAM10 through the NF- κB signal and the upregulation of BACE1 and PS1.307 In N2a cells induced by okadaic acid, the addition of melatonin can decrease GSK3 β mRNA levels, increase nuclear localization of Nrf2, and reduce the expression of many anti- inflammatory factors. 308 Overall, melatonin may play a significant role in inhibiting both the expression and phosphorylation activation of GSK3 β. Moreover, certain drugs have exhibited promising results in alleviating GSK3- induced tau hyperphosphorylation. Figure 3 compiles these drugs, primarily medications for neurological disorders such as agomelatine, 309 risperidone, 310 escitalopram, 311,312 valproate, 313 and cerebrolysin. 314 It also includes other classes of drugs such as dulaglutide, 315 lixisenatide, 316 atorvastatin, 317 sildenafil, 318 17beta- estradiol, 319 allantoin, 320 and sodium 4- phenylbutyrate. 321 Other treatments. Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a clinically objective and low- side- effect approach for treating diseases. In attempts to treat AD with mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, researchers have discovered numerous effects of the approach, including promoting lysosomal- autophagic clearance of A β and p- tau aggregates, inducing microglial M2 polarization, reducing MDA levels, enhancing neuronal dendrite growth, and reducing synaptic losses, among others. Mechanistically, mesenchymal stem cells regulate miR- 134 levels by activating SIRT1, thereby inhibiting GSK3β.322 In clinical- grade human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC- MSCs), significant restoration of cognitive function was observed in SAMP8 mice. In an AD cellular model, hUC- MSCs secreted hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) that targeted the cMet- AKT- GSK3β signaling pathway, downregulated hyperphosphorylated tau protein, reversed spine loss, and increased synaptic plasticity. 323 In another study using human fetal neuroepithelial cells (hNSCs) obtained from the endbrain of human fetuses aborted at 13 weeks and implanted in AD mice, TrkA/B phosphorylation in AD mice was significantly increased, which led to increased phosphorylation levels of AKT and GSK3β(Ser9). The inhibition of GSK3 β was accompanied by decreases in p- tau, BACE1, A β, deactivation of microglia, and reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion. 324 Exogenous administration of BDNF or neurotrophic peptidergic compounds is another emerging therapeutic approach for AD. Injection of BDNF into the hippocampus can enhance learning and memory in Okadaic acid- induced AD rats. Mechanistically, BDNF is thought to act on the PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibiting GSK3β activity and down- regulating the phosphorylation of tau protein at multiple sites, including p- tau (Thr231), and p- tau (Ser396/404). 325 A neurotrophic peptidergic compound, known as P021, has been reported to promote BDNF expression and exhibit a significant inhibitory effect on GSK3 β in 3 ×Tg- AD mice. At the epigenetic level, P021 improves cognitive impairment, reduces tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid plaque deposition, and promotes neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in AD mice.326 (D- Ser2)Oxm is a peptide hormone and growth factor similar to Oxyntomodulin that activates glucagon- like peptide 1 and glucagon receptors. In APP/PS1 mice, the administration of (D- Ser2)Oxm significantly increased p- PI3K and p- AKT expression in the hippocampus while reducing p- GSK3β- Y216 levels. Based on this potential mechanism, (D- Ser2)Oxm not only alleviated working memory and long- term spatial memory impairments, but also reduced the number of A β plaques in the hippocampus and reversed inhibition of LTP at the hippocampal synapses. 327 Electroacupuncture has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine and recent years have witnessed an increasing focus on its role in regulating nerve signal transduction and related diseases.328 In experiments involving APP/PS1 mice, electroacupuncture treatment at Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) acupoints has been shown to improve cognition while observably increasing p- AKTSer437, p- GSK3βSer9, and p- tau, emphasizing the importance of electroacupuncture on AKT/GSK3 β/tau signaling. 329 Additionally, high- frequency (50 Hz) electroacupuncture at GV20 and BL23 was found significantly enhancing learning and memory ability in AD rats with A β1- 42 induction. This treatment also inhibited GSK3 β, leading to increased synaptic curvature, reduced synaptic cleft width, increased postsynaptic density, and apparent neuroprotective effects against neuronal damage. 330 Moreover, for D- galactose- induced AD rats, preventive electroacupuncture at GV20- BL23 acupoints resulted in GSK3 β inhibition, down- regulation of p- mTOR, and ultimately enhanced autophagy. 331 Regular physical exercise is beneficial for human health, and running is considered an effective way to combat the AD process. In APP/PS1 mice, treadmill exercise for 5 months has been shown to inhibit GSK3 and p- tau but have no effect on CDK5.332",9672,3.pdf
12,Targeting dysregulated lipid metabolism for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: Current advancements and future prospects,2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2024.106505,abstract,"Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are two of the most frequent neurological diseases. The clinical features of AD are memory decline and cognitive dysfunction, while PD mainly manifests as motor dysfunction such as limb tremors, muscle rigidity abnormalities, and slow gait. Abnormalities in cholesterol, sphingolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism have been demonstrated to directly exacerbate the progression of AD by stimulating Aβ deposition and tau protein tangles. Indirectly, abnormal lipids can increase the burden on brain vasculature, induce insulin resistance, and affect the structure of neuronal cell membranes. Abnormal lipid metabolism leads to PD through inducing accumulation of α-syn, dysfunction of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and ferroptosis. Great progress has been made in targeting lipid metabolism abnormalities for the treatment of AD and PD in recent years, like metformin, insulin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists, and monoclonal antibodies targeting apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This review comprehensively summarizes the involvement of dysregulated lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, the application of Lipid Monitoring, and emerging lipid regulatory drug targets.

13,Targeting dysregulated lipid metabolism for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: Current advancements and future prospects,2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2024.106505,introduction,"Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are two of the most frequent neurological diseases (Aarsland ., 2011). AD accounts for approximately 60–70% of dementia cases worldwide, with an estimated 50 million people currently living with the condition globally (Collaborators, 2019). The latest projections indicate worrisome trends regarding the growth of dementia cases worldwide. Data shows that by 2050, the global prevalence of dementia is estimated to nearly double from current levels. However, if defined according to biological rather than solely clinical criteria for AD, the predicted rise in dementia cases may be even greater, potentially tripling in scale based on the available data (Nowell ., 2023; Scheltens ., 2021). Furthermore, PD has a significant influence on human health as the second most prevalent neurological illness after AD. In short, AD and PD are imposing increasingly weighty socioeconomic burdens. Accordingly, identifying efficacious therapeutic solutions takes on vital importance. Lipid homeostasis dysfunction may pose a risk for AD and PD (Sarchione ., 2021). Lipid metabolism disorders involve the accumulation of proteins caused by changes in lipid content and oxidative damage caused by lipid peroxidation, which are different from the metabolic behaviors of normal individuals. In the body fluid and brain tissue samples of AD and PD patients, we can detect differences in the levels of cholesterol, phospholipids, and other lipids between normal people and patients. The accumulation of abnormal tau protein and β-amyloid protein (Aβ) is the central feature of AD. The build-up of lipids like cholesterol and sphingolipid is linked to the accumulation of Aβ and tau protein (Flores-Leon and Outeiro, 2023; Hashemi ., 2022). In addition, abnormal lipid metabolism may indirectly affect the onset of AD through secondary pathological mechanisms. α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation is the main feature of PD, and the accumulation of lipids such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cholesterol is involved in the misfolding and aggregation of α-syn (Sarchione ., 2021). Abnormal attachment of α-syn to oxidized lipid metabolites also causes damage to organelles such as mitochondria (Ruipérez ., 2010). Many studies have also found that lipid peroxidation is strongly associated with ferroptosis, which causes neuronal death (Pope and Dixon, 2023). As was previously mentioned, research shows a role for disruption of lipid homeostasis in the etiology and development of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. By targeting specific aspects of lipid metabolism, it may be possible to develop novel therapeutics that help restore metabolic balance in the brain and slow cognitive and motor decline. Great progress has been made in targeting lipid metabolism abnormalities in order to cure PD and AD in recent years. Some common antidiabetic drugs like metformin (Li ., 2012), insulin (Kellar and Craft, 2020), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (Lourenco ., 2013), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP4) inhibitors (Kosaraju ., 2013) have shown potential therapeutic effects on AD and PD through enhancing brain synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. In addition, regulating key enzymes such as HMG-CoA reductase (Bar-On ., 2008) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Vincent ., 2018) can also affect cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and metabolism. Moreover, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists (Comerota ., 2023; Sastre ., 2003) can inhibit amyloidogenesis by improving insulin sensitivity. Monoclonal antibodies targeting lipid metabolism-related proteins like apolipoprotein E (ApoE) (Wang ., 2018) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) (Zhao ., 2022a) have demonstrated good anti-amyloidogenic effects by optimizing lipid transport and microglial cell functions respectively. This review comprehensively summarizes the participation of lipid metabolism in the development of AD and PD, the application of Lipid Monitoring, and emerging lipid regulatory drug targets. Greater knowledge of the lipidological roots of both AD and PD may pave the way for developing effective prevention and treatment methods for neurodegenerative disorders.",628,4.pdf
14,Targeting dysregulated lipid metabolism for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: Current advancements and future prospects,2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2024.106505,result,"2.1.1. Elevated cholesterol levels One of the most typical features of AD is Aβ accumulation. Aβ is generated through the successive hydrolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the enzymes β-secretase and γ-secretase (Hur, 2022). Aβ formation is promoted by the up-regulation of lipids, particularly cholesterol in the brain, which increases the ability that APP to bind to β-secretase and γ-secretase (Mett, 2021; Wang ., 2021). Furthermore, cholesterol impacts the polymerization of APP and γ-secretase’s processing of APP, leading to the generation of Aβ with diverse levels of toxicity and aggravation of Alzheimer’s Disease (Wu ., 2022). High cholesterol levels in neurons encourage Aβ-induced oxidative stress in mitochondria and impede the fusion of the dysfunctional mitochondria with lysosomes (de Dios ., 2023; Howe ., 2022), which increases the number of dysfunctional mitochondria and causes nerve cell death (Roca-Agujetas ., 2021). 2.1.2. Sphingolipid breakdown to ceramides Sphingolipids are a key component of lipid rafts and help regulate the production and accumulation of Aβ. Normal levels of sphingolipids inhibit the formation and buildup of Aβ peptides, thereby preventing Alzheimer’s disease progression. Research has found the increased breakdown of sphingomyelin, a type of sphingolipid, in the brains of AD patients. The enzyme sphingomyelinase catalyzes the breakdown of sphingomyelin to produce ceramides, which was shown to stabilize the accumulation of Aβ. Therefore, abnormal sphingomyelin breakdown in Alzheimer’s disease patients further exacerbates the accumulation of Aβ, leading to further worsening of AD, and the above process is also linked with sphingomyelinase activity (Czubowicz ., 2019; Xing ., 2023). 2.1.3. Other lipids Research has found that 27-hydroxycholesterol, a lipid that can easily pass the blood-brain barrier, increases expression of the enzyme β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which is known to play a significant part in Aβ production via causing the cleavage of APP. IκB phosphorylation and degradation were triggered by 27-OHC in SH-SY5Y cells at the molecular level, whose degradation product p65-p50 dimer was able to translocate to the BACE1 promoter region’s κB site in the nucleus, thereby upregulating the synthesis of BACE1 (Wu ., 2022). Studies have shown omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can inhibit the activity of β-secretase and γ-secretase and can also increase the activity of α-secretase, (Chen ., 2021), which may have the potential to reduce the formation and accumulation of toxic Aβ. Furthermore, it has been shown that certain ratios of phospholipid vesicle constituents contribute to the reduction of amyloid (Chaparro Sosa ., 2020). This finding also points to a relationship between phospholipids and Aβ formation. 2.2. Abnormal lipid levels promote tangled tau protein In AD patients’ brains, levels of the tau protein are elevated and abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau comprises a significant proportion. Phosphorylated tau loses its normal function as supporting microtubule stability. This disrupts the cytoskeleton leading to defects in axonal transport and neural connectivity (Merrick ., 1997). Studies have now linked imbalances in lipid metabolism to excessive tau phosphorylation. Disturbances to lipid metabolism can trigger inflammatory responses within the brain which promotes the formation and activation of different kinases and phosphatases involved in phosphorylation signaling cascades. Through these inflammatory mechanisms, imbalances in lipid processing may elevate tau phosphatase and kinase activity, thereby enhancing aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation (Chen and Yu, 2023; Ismail ., 2020). Dysregulation of PI3K-Akt signaling, which can result from imbalances in phosphatidylinositol levels and structural integrity of lipid rafts, may therefore promote aberrant tau phospho-regulation at multiple nodes (Yang ., 2020). This is achieved by activating downstream GSK3β and Cdk5, which function as tau phosphokinases (Yang ., 2020). Cholesterol metabolism has additionally been linked to the modulation of tau phosphorylation levels. Research has shown depleting cholesterol levels within lipid rafts can activate the raft-dependent Ras/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, leading to phosphorylation of tau protein at multiple sites (Mai ., 2022). This goes against what we previously concluded and therefore requires further investigation. 2.3. Imbalances in lipid metabolism indirectly accelerate AD Research indicates elevated cholesterol and imbalanced lipid processing increase the risk of atherosclerosis, whereby plaques accumulate within arteries. Over time, this atherogenic process can generate cerebrovascular lesions that diminish blood flow to the brain, exacerbating the underlying pathologies of AD (Cortes-Canteli and Iadecola, 2020).In addition, imbalanced lipid metabolism is linked to insulin resistance (Kerr ., 2023), a driving factor behind impaired glucose metabolism. When energetic pathways are compromised by insulin insensitivity, neural excitability may become diminished. This could lead to dysregulated neurotransmitter release and reuptake (Sę dzikowska and Szablewski, 2021). Over time, sustained excitatory/inhibitory imbalance poses injury risks to neurons. Triacylglycerols and very low-density lipoproteins, as two markers of lipid metabolism, have been flagged as likely contributors to diminished insulin sensitivity based on their metabolic profiles (Rhee ., 2011). Recent evidence points out that cholesterol is essential for maintaining typical synaptic architecture given its physical contribution to membrane composition. When cholesterol levels stray outside an optimal range, this destabilizes synaptic structures. Over time, such injuries to synaptic organization at the molecular level are likely to impair communication between neurons. If unaddressed, progressively deteriorating synapse structures and functions may therefore exacerbate disease progression (Li ., 2022a). 3. Dysregulated lipid metabolism leads to PD Neuropathologically, a defining feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the presence of proteinaceous inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LB), comprised primarily of aggregates of the protein α-syn (Spillantini ., 1997). Multiple biochemical processes are involved in PD, including mitochondrial or lysosomal malfunction and endoplasmic reticulum oxidative stress. In many recent studies, ferroptosis, a particular kind of lipid peroxidation-induced regulatory cell death, has also been gradually confirmed to be closely related to Parkinson’s disease (Dixon ., 2012; Dong-Chen ., 2023). Recently, researchers have observed changes in lipid metabolism in PD patients including sphingolipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis (Galper ., 2022; Sinclair ., 2021). Based on the above, we will discuss the connections between lipid metabolism and PD. 3.1. Abnormal lipid levels accelerate the accumulation of α-syn Lipid accumulation observed in patients with PD is involved in α-syn aggregation (see Fig. 2). Mutations in the GBA1 gene represent a major genetic risk factor for PD. GBA1 mutant reduces the activity of the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and leads to lysosomal dysfunction, therefore causing an abnormal build-up of cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Flores-Leon and Outeiro, 2023). PUFAs accumulate within cells due to lysosomal dysfunction and other reasons. The elevation of PUFA levels may impact the functioning of dopaminergic neurons by upregulating the expression of the α-syn gene and promoting the oligomerization of α-syn and the formation of toxic oligomers, thereby increasing the risk of PD (Assayag ., 2007; Yakunin ., 2012). At the same time, high levels of fatty acids can also cause α-syn aggregation, thus participating in the formation of LB (Erskine ., 2021). The interaction between α-syn and cellular membranes may facilitate its transformation from benign, soluble forms to toxic, insoluble aggregates (Marschallinger ., 2020). Cholesterol-rich domains such as lipid rafts may be the focal points for α-syn aggregation. Cholesterol is also thought to regulate the binding of α-syn to synaptic vesicle-like structures, potentially triggering their aggregation (Galvagnion, 2017; García-Sanz, 2021). Recent findings indicate levels of the lipid transport apolipoprotein (ApoE) are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of early PD patients. As ApoE encodes a protein that mediates lipid trafficking, this suggests α-syn may augment its spread between neurons by interacting with ApoE (Paslawski ., 2019). 3.2. Abnormal lipid levels lead to dysfunction of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum Lipid metabolism disorders such as fatty acids and cardiolipin participate in mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, which leads to dysfunction of neurons and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Excessive lipid accumulation can induce mitochondria-cytoplasmic stress response (MCSR), and the resulting ROS preferentially targets PUFAs, leading to the occurrence of PUFA peroxidation, thereby altering mitochondrial permeability and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Kim ., 2016). Research has established that Elovl2 is a key endoplasmic reticulum-located very long-chain fatty acid elongase. Deficiency of Elovl2 may result in impaired fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of short-chain fatty acids within the endoplasmic reticulum. The build-up of free fatty acids in the endoplasmic reticulum damages its function, leading to increased unfolded or misfolded protein load, chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress, and elevated risk of mitochondrial dysfunction (Li ., 2022c). There has been evidence of a decrease in SIRT6 activity in the brains of PD patients (Stein ., 2021). Research has shown that a deficiency of SIRT6 can lead to decreased mitochondrial gene expression, elevating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial decay, thereby initiating mitochondrial dysfunction (Smirnov ., 2023). In addition, disruption to mitochondrial lipid metabolism could further influence mitochondrial structure and function. Cardiolipin (CL) is a glycerophospholipid that is present in the mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotic cells (van Meer ., 2008). Misfolded α-syn interacting with cardiolipin has the potential to compromise the integrity of mitochondrial membranes and thereby impair mitochondrial function (Ghio ., 2016). Additionally, research has revealed that CL mediated the targeted autophagy of abnormal mitochondria, abnormal CL content could hinder mitochondrial autophagy, and abnormal mitochondrial aggregation could trigger inflammation through the NLRP3 inflammasome and/or cGAS-cgamp-STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway, further aggravation of neuronal cell damage (Chu ., 2013; Doblado ., 2021; Hsu and Shi, 2017; Tansey ., 2022). Hence, it can be inferred that there is a delicate balance between cardiolipin (CL), mitochondria, and Parkinson’s disease. Abnormal CL metabolism can lead to Parkinson’s disease by affecting mitochondrial function or inhibiting abnormal mitochondrial autophagy. The disorder of lipid metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes is also closely related to PD (Bantle ., 2020). Toxic fatty acids (FAs) generated in hyperactive neurons are transported to astrocyte lipid droplets via APOE-positive lipid particles and consumed through mitochondrial beta-oxidation for detoxification (Ioannou ., 2019). Pathogenic α-syn is involved in astrocyte mitochondrial dysfunction (Braidy ., 2013). Mitochondrial dysfunction of astrocytes can reduce FA metabolism, make neurons poisoned by FA, and aggravate the PD process. 3.3. Dysregulated lipid metabolism leads to ferroptosis Parkinson’s disease-related dopaminergic neuronal degeneration is linked to ferroptosis, which is primarily brought on by problems in lipid metabolism (Dixon ., 2012). Given the high lipid content in brain tissue, the central nervous system may be particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage caused by lipid peroxidation. Unrestricted lipid peroxidation is a hallmark of ferroptosis, and lipid peroxidation products play a key role in Parkinson’s disease (Gaschler and Stockwell, 2017; Yang ., 2016). PUFAs accumulated in PD patients are the main substrates for these peroxidation processes, and the elevated levels of peroxide substrates such as ceramide and lysophosphatidylcholine produced by peroxidation can lead to cellular oxidative damage, resulting in ferroptosis (Yan ., 2021; Yang ., 2016). Lipid peroxidation produces lipid free radicals and lipid peroxyl free radicals, which react with PUFAs to produce lipid peroxides, which further aggravate the oxidation process of PUFAs and accelerate the occurrence of ferroptosis (Stockwell ., 2017). The oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) and other polyunsaturated fatty acids in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) of the cell membrane can damage the membrane and induce ferroptosis (Astudillo ., 2023). In the condition of lipid metabolism disorders, glutathione peroxidase 4(GPX4) plays a role in alleviating ferroptosis by converting lipid peroxides into lipid alcohols. GPX4 activity decreased, and the antioxidant capacity of cells decreased, making PUFAs more easily oxidized, indirectly aggravating the process of ferroptosis (Costa ., 2023). Therefore, PD may arise as a result of abnormalities in lipid metabolism by affecting the process of desferrioxia. Taken above, it is not difficult to see that lipid metabolism plays an important role in the accumulation of α-syn, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. However, these effects do not exist independently in the pathogenesis of PD. Ferroptosis can affect the metabolism of α-syn and lead to its accumulation (Castellani ., 2000). Accumulation of α-syn can also cause mitochondrial dysfunction (Ordonez ., 2018). This vicious cycle causes the degree of Parkinson’s disease to gradually worsen, demonstrating the important role of lipid metabolism in the pathogenic process of Parkinson’s disease. 4. Application of lipid monitoring in AD and PD Previously, we summarized the relationship between lipid metabolism and AD and PD. A large number of studies have found that the levels of lipids and their metabolites in brain tissue and body fluids of AD and PD patients are different from those of healthy individuals or special patients with the disease (see Table 1 and Table 2). In AD patients, research has revealed that the degree of major membrane phospholipids in patients’ brains is considerably less than what was observed in the control group, and the related metabolites are increased. Monitoring the degree of phospholipid degeneration of brain cell membranes is an important index to judge the development of AD (Nitsch ., 1992). At the same time, the detection results of lipid levels in AD patients are also different for different races. Ethnic background also has an impact on lipid levels in AD patients, and lipid monitoring also has racial significance (Khan ., 2022). For patients with AD, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most prevalent type of sleep breathing disturbance. Plasma lipidomics is significantly different in these two types of patients (general AD patients versus AD patients with OSA), so lipid monitoring can be used to diagnose AD and severe OSA patients, permitting personalized management of these individuals (Dakterzada ., 2022). In the serum of PD patients, the proportion of most lipids is too high compared with the control group, and the difference in related metabolites can feedback the metabolic process in Parkinson’s disease. According to the monitored lipid changes, it can be inferred that 20 PD-related pathways such as carnitine shuttling, vitamin E metabolism, glycerol, sphingolipid, fatty acids, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis have significant changes (Pereira ., 2022). Additionally, lipid profiling can correlate specific lipid compositional features with the severity of PD. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is used to assess symptom severity, with higher scores indicating more serious manifestations. Research shows that higher levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and dihydro globotriaosylceramide (dhGB3) correlate positively with increased UPDRS scores and more severe PD symptoms. Meanwhile, elevated dihydrosphingomyelin (dhSM) and plasmenylethanolamine (PEp) are associated with lower UPDRS scoring and comparatively milder presentations of the disease (Avisar ., 2021). From the standpoint of brain structure and function, brain imaging methods include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), positron emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can noninvasively identify changes in brain biomarkers (Rathore ., 2017).In recent years, brain imaging biomarker genomics and metabolomics have been extensively utilized in the diagnosis and assessment of disease staging of AD and PD (Li ., 2022b). In addition, there is increasing evidence that the lipidomic markers are increasingly supporting the diagnosis, prognosis, and detection of therapeutic effects of AD and PD (Chiurchiù ., 2022). Therefore, we believe that brain imaging technology can be further used to monitor the lipid changes in the occurrence and treatment response of AD and PD, providing a new direction for future clinical research. 5. Therapeutic approaches targeted lipid metabolism Taken above, it is becoming more widely acknowledged that lipid metabolic abnormalities are a major contributing factor in the etiology of AD and PD. Here we summarize the therapeutic approaches that have been explored so far to modulate lipid metabolic dysfunction in AD and PD. 5.1. Dietary supplements and related enzymes To treat AD and PD, dietary supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have shown therapeutic promise (Strike ., 2016). PUFA supplementation improves hippocampus synaptic plasticity (Nagaraja ., 2021) and ameliorates (Strike ., 2016) cognitive deficits in AD animal models. Activation of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) by natural ligands, including 9-cis retinoic acid, and DHA plays a role in these positive effects (Casali ., 2015; de Urquiza ., 2000). Epidemiologically, increased intake of ω-3 PUFAs, particularly DHA and EPA, is associated with a reduced risk of AD, while lower ω-3 PUFA intake increases the risk (Zhang ., 2016) In this case, some enzyme inhibitors play a therapeutic role by inhibiting the lipid metabolism process of the enzyme (see Table 3). For example, the activity and expression of phospholipase A2 in AD are altered. Increased PLA2 activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients is accompanied by an increase in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which is associated with increased inflammation(Fonteh ., 2013). Different PLA2 subtypes have different effects on membrane remodeling and function (Chew ., 2020). Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) increases the severity of AD by oxidizing LDL and hydrolyzing it into two biologically active products, thereby promoting inflammation (Huang ., 2020). The application of Lp-PLA2 inhibitors may play a good role in the treatment of AD (Acharya ., 2013). The increase of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) enzyme activity mainly releases arachidonic acid, thus promoting the progress of the AD pathway, while reducing the ability of microglia to phagocytose Aβ in AD brain, thus further promoting the pathogenesis of the disease (Khan and Ilies, 2023). Therefore, relevant inhibitors may play a role in reducing the course of AD by blocking these pathways(Schaeffer ., 2011). 5.2. Antidiabetic drugs Antidiabetic drugs have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control, as they are also able to regulate lipid metabolism. As diabetes shares certain pathophysiological similarities with neurodegenerative diseases like AD and PD, researchers have explored whether existing antidiabetic therapies may also benefit these conditions (see Table 4). Metformin is a first-line treatment for diabetes and it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and build up to therapeutic amounts in the brain, according to studies. Metformin has gained interest for its potential neuroprotective effects in AD and PD through its ability to activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Li ., 2012; Mor ., 2020). As a key metabolic hormone, insulin (Kellar and Craft, 2020; Novak ., 2019) improves brain cognition and synaptic plasticity in AD and PD. Further, thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) improve insulin sensitivity by stimulating PPARs (see Table 4). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (Lourenco ., 2013; Yun ., 2018) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) (Cao ., 2018; Feng ., 2018) are secreted by enteroendocrine L cells in the intestine in response to nutrient ingestion and could promote the release of insulin. Inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is an enzyme that can rapidly degrade GLP-1 within two minutes (Kosaraju ., 2013; Nassar ., 2015), thus preserving active levels of endogenous GLP-1. 5.3. Targeting nuclear receptor superfamily The nuclear receptor superfamily controls the expression of target genes by binding to element-specific sequences located at gene promoter regions, regulating inflammation, energy balance, as well as lipid and glucose metabolism (Moutinho and Landreth, 2017). Due to their ability to lower toxic lipid products, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, and potential neuroprotective benefits, activating these receptors with specific agonists shows great promise for AD (Moutinho and Landreth, 2017). The retinoid bexarotene synthetic agonist, which the FDA licensed for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is a potent agonist of the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and has been shown to alleviate cognitive impairments in AD (Cramer ., 2012; Savage ., 2015). Among all the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), PPAR-α uniquely impacts excitatory cholinergic/dopaminergic signaling and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain. It also regulates mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and oxidative stress (Comerota ., 2023; Luo ., 2020). PPAR-γ is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cell differentiation relating to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory processes (Sastre ., 2003; Yamanaka ., 2012). PPAR-β/δ presides over the processes of myelination, lipid metabolism, and cellular differentiation (Chamberlain ., 2020). Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (REV-ERB α) is extensively involved in the regulation of the biological clock as well as the control of glucose metabolism and triglyceride levels (Lee ., 2023).(see Table 5.) 5.4. Targeting APOE and TREM Apolipoprotein E (APOE) fulfills an important function in the reallocation of cholesterol and additional lipids to nerve cells by fastening to receptors on the cellular membrane. A clinical study displayed that carriers of the APOE ε4 variant demonstrate heightened Aβ accumulation within the cerebral cortex (Mishra ., 2018). APOE ε2 and APOE ε3 are discovered to clear Aβ, but the influence of APOE ε4 in propelling the process of AD and PD appears poised to surpass the protective impact of APOE ε2 and APOE ε3 (Jansen ., 2015). Major approaches to treating Alzheimer’s disease by targeting APOE include modulating APOE’s expression levels, structure, receptors, or interactions with other molecules such as amyloid-beta (reviewed in Table 6). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is predominantly expressed as a type-1 transmembrane protein, and it is targeted to the plasma membrane together with its co-receptor DAP12, has been prone to bind to APOE4 (Schlepckow ., 2023). TREM2 agonistic antibodies act by binding to the TREM2 receptor, activating its downstream SYK signaling pathway, thereby enhancing microglial chemotaxis and energy metabolism, increasing phagocytosis, and thus clearing pathological products such as Aβ (Ellwanger ., 2021; Zhao ., 2022a). 6. Conclusions and prospect In conclusion, dysregulated lipid metabolism can lead to lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, which damages neurons and increases the risk of AD and PD. Abnormalities in cholesterol, sphingolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Abnormal lipid levels can directly accelerate the progression of AD by encouraging the deposition of Aβ as well as tau protein tangles. Indirectly, abnormal lipids can increase the burden on brain vasculature, induce insulin resistance, and affect the structure of neuronal cell membranes. Abnormal lipid metabolism leads to PD through inducing accumulation of α-syn, dysfunction of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and ferroptosis. Targeting specific steps in lipid pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies. However, more research is still needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms and identify potential drug targets. Future studies should further explore the interactions between lipid metabolism and other pathways implicated in neurodegeneration, such as protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Large clinical trials are also warranted to evaluate whether modulating lipid metabolism can alleviate disease symptoms or slow progression. It is suggested to utilize PET imaging and other molecular imaging techniques to longitudinally monitor changes in brain lipid metabolism in response to different therapeutic interventions. Multi-target treatment strategies should be explored to better modulate lipid metabolism at different steps in the pathogenic pathway. Gaining more insight into the lipidological underpinnings of AD and PD could lead to the development of successful preventative and therapeutic strategies for these prevalent age-related neurodegenerative illnesses. What’s more, a recent study found that sex differences(Sex generally refers to a set of biological attributes that are associated with physical and physiological features) have a profound impact on the risk of AD and PD, with women having a higher probability of AD than men and a lower probability of PD than men (Podcasy and Epperson, 2016). This may be closely related to changes in estrogen in women. Estrogen is involved in brain lipid metabolism, and the instability of its level will affect the stability of lipid metabolism (Morselli ., 2018). At the same time, the decreased level of circulating estrogen in post-menopausal women is another risk factor for AD and is also intimately linked to the onset and progression of PD (Grimm ., 2016; Picillo ., 2017). Although there is no direct evidence to prove the mechanism of estrogen involvement in AD and PD processes, we further speculate that the lipid metabolism disorder caused by the instability of estrogen levels in women is an important reason for the sex difference in the incidence of AD and PD. Therefore, future studies should further investigate the influence of sex on lipid dysregulation in AD and PD.",3979,4.pdf
15,Targeting tau in Alzheimer's disease: from mechanisms to clinical therapy,2023,https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.385847,abstract,"Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease affecting older adults. Primary features of Alzheimer’s disease include extracellular aggregation of amyloid-β plaques and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, formed by tau protein, in the cells. While there are amyloid-β-targeting therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, these therapies are costly and exhibit potential negative side effects. Mounting evidence suggests significant involvement of tau protein in Alzheimer’s disease-related neurodegeneration. As an important microtubule-associated protein, tau plays an important role in maintaining the stability of neuronal microtubules and promoting axonal growth. In fact, clinical studies have shown that abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein occurs before accumulation of amyloid-β in the brain. Various therapeutic strategies targeting tau protein have begun to emerge, and are considered possible methods to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s disease. Specifically, abnormalities in post-translational modifications of the tau protein, including aberrant phosphorylation, ubiquitination, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation, acetylation, and truncation, contribute to its microtubule dissociation, misfolding, and subcellular missorting. This causes mitochondrial damage, synaptic impairments, gliosis, and neuroinflammation, eventually leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits. This review summarizes the recent findings on the underlying mechanisms of tau protein in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease and discusses tau-targeted treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.",203,5.pdf
16,Targeting tau in Alzheimer's disease: from mechanisms to clinical therapy,2023,https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.385847,introduction,"Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, maintains microtubule stability in neurons and promotes axonal growth. Under physiological conditions, hypophosphorylated tau is localized in the axons of neurons. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) made of accumulated tau protein and senile plaques made of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) are the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Wang and Liu, 2008). Significant advancement in understanding the role of tau toxicity in the pathogenesis of AD has been made in the past few decades. Studies have shown that post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation, and truncation of tau protein participate in its stability, misfolding, accumulation, and degradation (Wang and Liu, 2008). Accumulation of tau protein in cells leads to cognitive deficits, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, the impairment of synaptic plasticity, gliosis, and neuroinflammation via multiple pathways (Wang and Liu, 2008). In this review, we summarize the role of tau protein in these processes. Moreover, we provide an overview of tau toxicity in synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning in AD. Finally, we discuss the application potential of tau protein as a therapeutic target for ameliorating AD-related cognitive deficits and other related tauopathies.",187,5.pdf
17,Targeting tau in Alzheimer's disease: from mechanisms to clinical therapy,2023,https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.385847,result,"Abnormal PTMs impair the affinity of tau-microtubule binding, thus increasing free tau protein in the cytoplasm. Accumulated free tau protein promotes the formation of tau aggregates, which causes mitochondrial damage, impairs synaptic plasticity, and glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation ( Figure 3). The implications and mechanism of tau toxicity in these pathological conditions are critically involved in eliciting/aggravating neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits in AD (Wang ., 2020c; Gratuze ., 2021).

Alteration in the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission based on preexisting synaptic activity is called synaptic plasticity and is extensively accepted as the cellular basis of learning and memory. The molecular mechanisms behind impairments in synaptic plasticity induced by tau can be classified into two categories. First, synaptic abnormalities are induced by direct mislocalization of tau. Studies have shown localization of neurotoxic tau in the dendrites, dendritic spines, neuronal membranes, and nuclear speckle, which obstructs the formation of new synapses and impairs the stability of preexisting synapses (Hoover ., 2010; Ittner ., 2010; Merezhko ., 2018; Lester ., 2021; Prikas ., 2022). Recently, with the development of new biochemical technologies, such as the engineered ascorbic acid peroxidase approach with quantitative affinity purification mass spectrometry, high-throughput proteomics, ultra-high magnification microscopic imaging, and proximity ligation assays, tau interactome at subcellular and amino acid levels in human neurons have been conducted. These tau interactomes have revealed interactions between tau and presynaptic vesicle proteins during activity-dependent tau secretion, as well as the tau-binding sites to the cytosolic domains of integral synaptic vesicle proteins (Largo-Barrientos ., 2021; Tracy ., 2022). These advancements provide authentic illustrations of the properties of synaptic tau mislocalization. Second, tau overexpression may suppress the transcription of synapse-regulating genes by altering multiple synapsis-associated transcriptional factors. Ours and others’ studies have shown the involvement of mammalian signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) in regulating tau-induced defects in synaptic plasticity (Li ., 2019; Zhang ., 2021). A different study found that tau accumulation in cells activates JAK2-dependent STAT1 in animal models and patients with AD. While STAT1 directly binds to the GAS element of GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B promoters to suppress N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors expression (Li ., 2019), STAT3 positively regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor transcription. Additionally, studies have shown STAT3 inactivation in tau-accumulating neurons in AD and frontotemporal dementia (Hong ., 2020; Wan ., 2021). Mechanically, tau directly acetylates STAT1, enhancing its binding to STAT3 in the cytoplasm, thus sequestering and inhibiting the translocation of STAT3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and eventually reducing STAT3 transcription (Wan ., 2021), Finally, tau activates STAT1 and inhibits STAT3 to reduce the transcription and expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor proteins (Li ., 2019; Wan ., 2021). The involvement of transcription factor CREB in regulating learning and memory has been widely studied. When Ser133 residue of the kinase-inducible domain of CREB is phosphorylated by PKA, ERK, and Ca 2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, CBP , a transcriptional coactivator, is then recruited to CREB to activate it (Briand ., 2015). Overexpression of human wild-type, full-length tau significantly dephosphorylates CREB at Ser133 residue by activating phosphatase calcineurin and suppressing calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV expression (Yin ., 2016). Moreover, tau inhibits PKA activity by increasing nuclear proteasome-dependent PKA regulatory subunit 2α levels, thereby dephosphorylating CREB (Ye ., 2020). Histone acetylation, an epigenetic mechanism, has received widespread attention in AD. Inhibition of histone 3, acetylated at K19 and K14, and histone 4, acetylated at K5 and K12, by increasing the expression of acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member A, which is a key component of inhibitor of acetyltransferases, leads to synapse-related proteins decrease (Chai ., 2017, 2018).

Reactive gliosis and neuroinflammation are closely associated with tau accumulation and neuronal degeneration in AD and other tauopathies. The prolonged activation of glial cells, primarily astrocytes and microglia, induces the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species. This creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment in glial cells and neurons. Recently, conditional genetic manipulation and genome-wide association studies have identified multiple immune-related genes (TREM2, CD33, ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA) 7, CX3CR1, CR1, and BIN1) as risk factors for tau pathology and AD, thereby supporting a critical involvement of glial cells and neuroinflammation in tauopathies (Zhong ., 2017; Pimenova ., 2018; Brunello ., 2020; Wang ., 2020b, 2022; Griciuc and Tanzi, 2021; Haass, 2021; Jin ., 2021; Lee ., 2021; Wang and Ye, 2021; Zhao ., 2022; Zhu ., 2022; Jain ., 2023; Ochoa ., 2023; Udeochu ., 2023).
In the early stage of tau pathology, intracellular accumulation of tau protein causes neuronal oxidative stress, which results in the production and release of cytokines, inflammatory chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, thus provoking adjacent glial cell responses and mild inflammation. Furthermore, persistent excessive accumulation of pathological tau promotes neuronal death and production of cell debris, leading to intense glial cell activation and neuroinflammation. Additionally, pathological tau can be released into the extracellular space in free form or encapsulated by extracellular vesicles or exosomes (Brunello ., 2020). Extracellular tau can enter glial cells through phagocytosis or receptor mediated endocytosis, thereby activating various inflammatory pathways in glial cells. For example, a recent study demonstrated that pathological tau protein in microglia can activate the inner immune pathway cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interaction genes, thus promoting nuclear translation of nuclear factor κB and inflammatory gene transcription (Jin ., 2021). The type I interaction signal is also a downstream of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator in the interaction genes pathway, which responds to tau accumulation and mediates tau-dependent microglial inflammation (Udeochu ., 2023). In primary astrocytes, recombinant filamentous human tau can enter the cell by directly binding to integrin αV/β1 receptor, resulting in nuclear factor κB activation, neurotoxic astrocyte-like cell phenotype, and the release of inflammatory factors (Wang and Ye, 2021). Moreover, pathogenic tau can drive neuroinflammation through elevated double-stranded RNA in astrocytes (Ochoa ., 2023).
In the brain, microglia are the resident innate immune cells that play a central role in tau-related neuroinflammation. In patients with AD and tau transgenic mice, reactive microglia hierarchically associate with pathological tau. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 expressed on the surface of microglia is a risk factor in the preclinical stages of AD. In the cerebrospinal fluid, a positive correlation was observed between TREM2 and total tau, as well as phosphorylated tau (Zhong ., 2017). Studies have shown that loss-of-function mutation (especially R47H) or deletion of TREM2 could increase the accumulation and spreading of tau protein and brain atrophy in amyloid pathology (Haass, 2021; Lee ., 2021; Zhu ., 2022). While a recent study reported that chronic TREM2 activation exacerbates the seeding and spreading of Aβ-related tau (Jain ., 2023), several earlier studies have presented the beneficial effects of TREM2 agonist antibodies in private amyloid pathology (Wang ., 2020b; Zhao ., 2022). A possible explanation may be that the activation of TREM2 downstream signaling, such as nuclear factor κB signaling, could exacerbate tau spread and toxicity in an Aβ-independent manner (Wang ., 2022). Other AD risk factors are enriched by or are uniquely expressed in microglia, such as ATP-binding cassette transporter family, complement, CD33, HLA-family, MEF2C, and MS4A family, have been identified by genome-wide association studies (Pimenova ., 2018; Griciuc and Tanzi, 2021).
Astrocytes, the most abundant type of cells in the brain, are critically involved in regulating neuronal homeostasis and neuroinflammation. It is believed that neurotoxic reactive astrocytes (also named A1 astrocytes), which highly upregulate many classical complemental cascade genes (C1q, C3a, C3b, C3d), exhibit impaired phagocytosis and promote neuronal death. By contrast, A2 astrocytes are neuroprotective with high expression levels of neurotrophic factors (Liddelow ., 2017). Reactive astrocytes surrounding NFTs and Aβ plaques are neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Manipulating the expression of several astrocyte-related genes, such as complement C3, interleukin-3, chitinase-3-like protein 1, alpha 2-Na +/K+ adenosine triphosphatase, and histone acetylase 7, exert beneficial effects on reprograming microglia and limiting neuroinflammation (Litvinchuk ., 2018; Lananna ., 2020; McAlpine ., 2021; Mann ., 2022; Ye ., 2022). Additionally, genetic tau overexpression or treatment of recombinant tau fibrils drives astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation (Wang and Ye, 2021; Ezerskiy ., 2022). Moreover, the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein may serve as a candidate blood-based biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with AD (Chatterjee ., 2022).

Mitochondria provide energy via oxidative phosphorylation to support neuronal activity and maintain the normal functioning of neurons (McElroy ., 2023; Trigo ., 2023; Wen ., 2023). A study has shown that neurotoxic tau protein could disrupt the structural and functional integrity of mitochondria, including impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, abnormal mitochondrial fusion, fission, trafficking, and distribution, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, and damaged mitophagy (Wang ., 2020c). Mounting evidence has demonstrated that tau accumulation promotes abnormal mitochondrial elongation and alters the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins, such as a decrease in dynamin-like protein 1 (DLP1) expression level (DuBoff ., 2012) or an increase in optic atrophy 1 and mitofusin (Mfn) expression level (DuBoff ., 2012; Li ., 2016). One study revealed that DLP1 abnormally interacts with hyperphosphorylated tau in AD neurons (Manczak and Reddy, 2012), which may partly explain low DLP1 expression in mitochondria. Studies have also shown a significant decrease in the expression level of all large dynamin-related GTPases, such as DLP1, optic atrophy 1, Mfn1, and Mfn2, in the AD brain (Wang ., 2009; Manczak and Reddy, 2012). Different tau isoforms exert varied disrupting effects on mitochondrial distribution. A recent study demonstrated that overexpression of 1N3R-tau in astrocytes of the dentate gyrus can significantly decrease mitochondrial distribution in distal processes, whereas the 1N4R isoform of tau promotes mitochondria redistribution toward the soma (Richetin ., 2020). Interestingly, our unpublished data have shown that P301S tau induces mitochondrial fission, whereas full-length human tau, 2N4R, induces mitochondrial fusion (Li ., 2016).
In addition, accumulated tau impairs mitophagy by disrupting the parkin-dependent degradation of damaged mitochondria. Overexpression of wildtype and mutant tau in primary hippocampal neurons or neuroblastoma cells reduces translocation of parkin in the mitochondria due to abnormal interactions between parkin and tau projection domain, thus sequestering it in the cytosol (Hu ., 2016; Cummins ., 2019). Activation of mitophagy by supplementing NAD +, urolithin A, melatonin, and actinonin can attenuate the hyperphosphorylation of AD-associated tau in human neuronal cells and reverse memory deficits in vivo (Fang ., 2019).",1758,5.pdf

Therefore, we established an ibuprofen and FK506 encapsulated drug co-delivery system (Ibu&FK@RNPs), which can target the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and response to the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD. RAGE is highly and specifically expressed on the lesion neurovascular unit of AD, this property helps to improve targeting specificity of the system and reduce unselective distribution in normal brain. Meanwhile, these two drugs can be specifically released in astrocytes of AD lesion in response to high levels of ROS. As a result, the cognition of AD mice was significantly improved and the quantity of A b plaques was decreased. Neurotoxicity was also alleviated with structural regeneration and functional recovery of neurons. Besides, the neuroinflammation dominated by NF-kB pathway was significantly inhibited with decreased NF-kBa n dI L - 1b in the brain. Overall, Ibu&FK@RNPs can efficiently and successively target diseased BBB and astrocytes in AD lesion. Thus it significantly enhances intracephalic accumulation of drugs and efficiently treats AD by anti-neuroinflammation and neuroprotection.",199,6.pdf
19,Intelligent lesion blood–brain barrier targeting nano-missiles for Alzheimer's disease treatment by anti-neuroinflammation and neuroprotection,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2022.02.001,introduction,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the most challengeable neuro-degenerative diseases, is characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment occurring in old and pre-old age 1. However, there were only five available medicines before 2021 2, so it is urgent to find effective therapeutic targets and develop efficacious pharmaceutical preparations. The mainstream direction of AD researches is b amyloid (A b) cascade hypothesis, but all clinical trials were interrupted due to the lack of damaged neuronal recovery 2e4. Alternatively, there emerged other therapeutic targets of AD, including microtubule-associated protein, anti-neuroinflammation, synaptic and neuroprotection, metabolism, neurogenesis, vascular system and epigenetic drugs, among which the number of anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective drugs has fastest growing 5. Besides, more and more researches have shown the comprehensive effects of multiple pathogenic mechanisms in AD, showing the common feature of neuroinflammatory microenvironment 6. Neuroinflammation, characterized by excessively activated glial cells and overexpressed inflammatory factors in AD, can interact with neurons and lead to protein deposition and neuronal dysfunction6e9. The corresponding neuronal responses will conversely stimulate inflammation to form a vicious circle and aggravate AD 10. Therefore, it would be effective by using anti-neuroinflammatory treatment to undermine the positive feedback loop of neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF- kB) pathway mainly exists in excessively activated astrocytes of neurodegenerative diseases, and it plays an important role in anti-neuroinflammatory mechanisms 6e9. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most widely used drugs in inhibiting NF- kB signaling pathway 11e17, and high-dose of ibuprofen have been confirmed to improve dementia-like symptoms in AD animal models 18e20. Moreover, ibuprofen can normalize the microenvironment of the lesion to stop disease deterioration. But it can’t make neuronal damages reversed to cure AD completely. So it is necessary to use neuroprotective drugs additionally. Calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, FK506), the most effective neuroprotective drug in central nervous system diseases, can maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis to improve neuronal repair and regeneration 21e26. Moreover, the amelioration of AD-like behavior has been observed in patients taking FK506 21,24,26. To sum up, we combined ibuprofen and FK506 for AD treatment, which could not only inhibit neuroinflammation mediated by NF-kB pathway, but also exert neuroprotective effects. For brain targeted drug delivery, the blood ‒brain barrier (BBB), which is composed by dense endothelial cells and supported by multiple cells, greatly restricts their internalization and transportation 27e29. To overcome BBB, receptor-mediated transport (CMT) is the most widely used strategy in nano-targeted delivery systems27,30. However, traditional CMT-based brain targeting delivery leads to unselective distribution in whole brain because of the homogenous expression of targeted receptors on BBB 31.I ti s important to find targets that are restrictively expressed on BBB of lesion 32. In AD lesion sites, the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is specifically and highly expressed on the diseased neurovascular unit, including cerebral vascular endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons 33e37. RAP peptide (sequence: CELKVLMEKEL) is a specific ligand of RAGE, which could assist with the transportation of nanoparticles into diseased brain parenchyma through CMT38. Furthermore, microenvironment responsive drug delivery systems could be introduced to achieve rapid and responsive drug release in the lesion and reduce undemand drug leakage in healthy areas 39e41. In view of the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD 42,43, ROS-sensitive thioether bond (MAH-EDT) was introduced into nanoparticles, which would be broken when exposed in ROS, inducing nanoparticles decomposition and drug release 44,45. Eventually, the ROS-responsive RAGE-targeted drug delivery system was established for ibuprofen and FK506 delivery. In this study, we developed an ROS-responsive and RAGE-targeted drug delivery platform (Ibu&FK@RNPs). The ROS-sensitive sulfur ether linker (MAH-EDT) was used to link polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with RAP-modified at PEG-terminus, and then self-assembled into nanoparticles with ibuprofen and FK506 encapsulated ( Fig. 1 A). With the assistance of RAP, Ibu&FK@RNPs targeted RAGE on diseased BBB and was transported into targets cells by CMT. After reaching the AD lesion and exposed in the high level of ROS, Ibu&FK@RNPs collapsed and instantaneously released ibuprofen and FK506 to treat AD ( Fig. 1 B). As a result, the cognition of AD mice was significantly improved and the production of A b plaques was inhibited. Neurotoxicity induced by calcium homeostasis imbalance was also alleviated and the neuroinflammatory response was significantly inhibited. Overall, this system successively targeted the BBB in AD lesion, astrocytes and neurons, thus significantly enhancing the intracephalic drug accumulation and treatment efficacy.",726,6.pdf
20,Intelligent lesion blood–brain barrier targeting nano-missiles for Alzheimer's disease treatment by anti-neuroinflammation and neuroprotection,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2022.02.001,result,"Firstly, the ROS-sensitive polymer (PEP) was obtained according to the synthetic routes ( Fig. 2 A). Then RAP was decorated in the PEG-terminals of PEP to form the RAGE-targeted polymer (PEPR). Intermediate products were characterized by 1H NMR spectrum ( Supporting Information Fig. S1 ) and MALDI-TOF MS (Supporting Information Fig. S2 ), respectively. Finally, PCL-MPEG, PEPR and drugs were mixed proportionally, and then self-assembled to prepare nanoparticles by the solvent diffusion method. According to the bEnd.3 and PC12 cell viabilities by MTT assay ( Supporting Information Fig. S3 ), cells were pre-incubated with 20 mmol/L A b oligomers for 12 h to simulate the pathological condition of AD 34,35,37. Based on the bEnd.3 cell uptake efficiencies, Cou6@R 1NPs performed the best, which was 1.42 times higher than Cou6@NPs ( Supporting Information Fig. S4 ). Therefore, RNPs with 6.7% RAP modification was used in the following experiments. The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of Ibu&FK@RNPs were 86.87 nm and /C0 38.31 mV, respectively (Supporting Information Table S2 ). The drug-loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency of ibuprofen were 60.48% and 4.24%, with those of FK506 were 55.56% and 6.79%, respectively. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) demonstrated spherical morphology of nanoparticles with a uniform dispersity and the diameter of Ibu&FK@RNPs was about 20 nm (Fig. 2 B). An excellent stability of nanoparticles incubated in PBS and plasma is required to ensure their stable condition before and after administration 48. After incubated in water or PBS for 48 h, there were no changes in the hydrodynamic diameters and PDI (Supporting Information Fig. S5 ). However, after 12 h incubation with 10% and 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS), their hydrodynamic diameters increased 30 e60 nm and 50 e60 nm, respectively, along with stable PDI. The reasons for above results might include the electrostatic repulsion 49 and formation of nanoparticle corona 50,51. Therefore, the nanoparticles can be stored in water and PBS buffer for at least 48 h. The cumulative release rate of FK506@RNPs in different solutions was measured by dialysis bags method ( Fig. 2 C)52. The 48 h cumulative FK506 release of nanoparticles in 100 mmol/L H2O2 solution was 45% e60%, while that in PBS was 20% e30%. The results show FK506 release was ROS-responsive. According to the results of previous researches, the intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg of FK506 or 16.5 mg/kg of ibuprofen, equal to 50 mg/L of FK506 and 825 mg/L of ibuprofen in cells, might be effective to treat AD 24,53. Cytotoxicity by MTT assays was measured to study the safety of Ibu&FK@RNPs ( Fig. 3 A and B, and Supporting Information Fig. S6 ). The results showed the cell viabilities of Ibu&FK@NPs and Ibu&FK@RNPs were about 100% and 97% respectively, indicating the good biosafety at treatment dose. The bEnd.3 cell was pre-incubated with A b to simulate diseased BBB. The 2 h bEnd.3 cell internalization of Cou6-labeled nanoparticles was quantitatively analyzed by flow cytometry and imaged by confocal imaging ( Fig. 3 C and D). The cellular uptake of Cou6@RNPs was 1.42 times higher than Cou6@NPs in diseased bEnd.3 cells, while there was no difference in healthy cells. This result was consistent with corresponding confocal images, proving that RAP promoted internalization of nanoparticles specifically by the diseased cerebral vascular endothelial cell, but it did not work in normal state. Further, the inhibitor of RAGE, FPS-ZM1 was used to study the mechanism of RAP targeting ( Supporting Information Fig. S7 ). Pre-incubated with FPS-ZM1 in diseased PC12 cells, the cellular uptake of Cou6@RNPs was 1.36 times lower than that without inhibitors, while there was no difference in the Cou6@RNPs group. The results dedicate that the enhanced cellular uptake of RAP-modified nanoparticles was ascribed to targeting RAGE. On the other hand, the bEnd.3 monolayer pre-incubated A b was established to determine transportation of RNPs across the diseased BBB. After bEnd.3 cells seeded, the transmembrane resistance of monolayers was measured by a resistor every day 54. Until Day 10, transmembrane resistance was stable at about 170 U, and then cells were incubated with 20 mmol/L A b oligomers for 12 h to simulate the diseased BBB. Then different Cou6-labeled nanoparticles were added into donor chamber of transwells and illustrated their transmembrane efficiency in 3D confocal images ( Fig. 3 E). The longitudinal ( Z-axis) illustrated that Cou6@RNPs penetrated faster and deeper than control nanoparticles. The 4 h penetration depth of RNPs is much deeper than NPs in 12 h, indicating that RNPs had better diseased BBB transcytosis than controlled nanoparticles. This finding demonstrates the superiority of RAP modification in the diseased BBB penetration. To explore the in vivoBBB transcytosis and brain accumulation of nanoparticles in AD, the Cy5.5-labeled ibuprofen (Cy5.5-Ibu) was synthesized and demonstrated by 1H NMR spectrum ( Supporting Information Fig. S8 ). And then the biodistribution of Cy5.5-Ibu-labeled nanoparticles in AD mice were monitored by living imaging ( Fig. 4 A). As living images illustrated, the brain fluorescent intensity of mice administrated Cy5.5-Ibu@RNPs was continuously enhanced and increased to the top between 4 and 6 h, while there were no obvious changes in NPs group. After being administrated for 6 h, mice were sacrificed and ex vivoimages of main organs were obtained ( Fig. 4 B and Supporting Information Fig. S9A ). Although high level of nanoparticles was distributed in livers, the brain fluorescence intensity of RNPs group was much stronger than NPs group, which was 1.55 times higher according to semi-quantification ( Fig. 4 C). The results demonstrated that RAP modification endowed faster BBB transportation and more brain accumulation of nanoparticles in AD mice. Brains were also sliced to observe the accumulation of nanoparticles and immuno-fluorescence colocation with RAGE by confocal imaging ( Fig. 4 D). The brain fluorescence intensity of Cy5.5-Ibu in RNPs group was much stronger than NPs group, and the obvious RAGE immuno-fluorescence images colocation was observed in RAP-modified nanoparticles. Moreover, there were no obvious differences of distribution in peripheral organs between RNPs and NPs, with similar findings illustrated in the confocal images of organs frozen slices ( Supporting Information Fig. S9B and C ). These results indicate that RAP modification could improve the BBB transportation and facilitate brain accumulation of nanoparticles by targeted RAGE. After 1, 2, 4 and 4 h treatment, the concentration of drugs in blood was gradually decreased ( Fig. 4 E and Supporting Information Fig. S10 ). In the hippocampus and brain, concentration of FK506 was gradually raised to the top in 4 h. Besides, RAP peptide-modified nanoparticles had higher drug concentration in brain, indicating the peptide modification could improve the brain and AD targeting delivery capacity. However, the concentration ‒time curves of ibuprofen showed different trend which could be explained by its faster metabolism. Progressive cognitive dysfunction and impaired behavior are typical clinical symptoms of AD 2, so Morris Water maze test is often used to assess the behavioral conditions in animal experiment. During training, the average time spent to reach the platform of mice administrated PBS, Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@NPs were fluctuating and irregular ( Fig. 5 A). However, the above condition did not appear in the Ibu&FK@RNPs group whose average incubation period to reach the platform was gradually shortened and similar to healthy mice, which implied strong learning and memory abilities. After the training was completed, spatial probe test was experimented with the original platform removed ( Fig. 5 B and Supporting Information Fig. S11 ). In the placed navigation test, representative swimming paths of AD mice showed aimless circles in PBS and Ibuprofen&FK506 groups. In contrast, the swimming paths of Ibu&FK@RNPs group and healthy mice were purposeful in searching for the platform and concentrated in the target quadrant. In addition, time spent to reach the platform was also presented statistically different (Fig. 5 C). Compared with the mice treated by PBS (39.6 /C6 18.3 s), Ibuprofen&FK506 (27.2 /C6 12.7 s) and Ibu&FK@NPs (31.7 /C6 9.1 s), the AD mice administrated with Ibu&FK@RNPs took the least time (10.2 /C6 5.2 s) to reach the platform, which was similar to healthy mice (11.9 /C6 4.4 s). The frequencies of mice passing through the location of original platform were also counted ( Fig. 5 D). The AD mice treated with PBS passed through the platform for less than once, while Ibuprofen&FK506 (2.2 /C6 1.1 times) or Ibu&FK@NPs (2.2 /C6 1.2 times) groups increased, respectively. Besides, compared with healthy mice (4.0 /C6 1.7 times), the Ibu&FK@RNPs group showed similar frequency (4.3 /C6 1.2 times). These results suggested the sense of space in AD mice could be improved by Ibu&FK@RNPs and reflected the RAGE targeted drug depot significantly improved the intracerebral drug delivery and ameliorated learning acquisition and the sense of space of AD. Although all A b targeted medicines were terminated, A b plaques were still recognized as the characteristic physiological marker of AD 5. Immunohistochemical staining was used to illustrate the amount of A b plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 5 E). We observed many and large plaques, illustrating A b plaques were overexpressed in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Excitingly, the A b plaques burden was significantly reduced by 1.64 times after the treatment of Ibu&FK@RNPs and there was no statistic difference in combination drug treatment ( Fig. 5 F). This result indicates the combination medication could specifically inhibit the production of toxic isoform A b plaques. However, the modification of nanocarriers had few efficacies in reducing A b plaques. In AD, A b plaques and tau tangles work together to increase intracellular concentration of Ca 2þ and induce neurotoxicity 22. Thus, we evaluated the function of neurons by Nissl staining (Fig. 6 A and B). We chose to evaluate the CA1 area because it was prone to be damaged in the hippocampus. The marked neuronal damages, including neuronal hypocellularity, were observed in the CA1 hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mice treated with PBS, Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@NPs. Nevertheless, the above phenomena were not found in healthy mice and Ibu&FK@RNPs groups. Besides, the quantitative expression of Nissl’s body in the CA1 area showed that the quantitative in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 3 times higher than that of APP/PS1 mice. These results demonstrated that RAP-modified formulations attenuated the impairment of neuronal integrity as well as neuron loss . Additionally, new neurons could continue to be generated throughout the adulthood of healthy mammals and the nerve regeneration might be promoted by FK506 21,25. In consequence, the synaptic change of neuron skeleton protein (MAP2) is usually used to monitor the neurite outgrowth and provide a subtler indication of neuronal function55. From the immuno-fluorescence of MAP2, hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@RNPs groups showed decreased MAP2 expression, while healthy mice and the Ibu&FK@RNPs group had more positive expression of MAP2 ( Fig. 6 C and D). Accordingly, Ibu&FK@RNPs could not only effectively protect the neurons, but also increase the number of synapses to ameliorate the memory decline. The active neuroinflammatory responses in the AD brain were manifested by excessive activation of glial cells and over-expression of inflammatory factors 47. The immuno-fluorescence images of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed dendroid chunks spreading among the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice and Ibuprofen&FK506 groups, illustrating the over-activated astrocytes of AD ( Fig. 7A and Supporting Information Fig. S12A ). The inhibited status of astrocytes was demonstrated by the small strip and spotty fluorescence signals of GFAP which was showed in Ibu&FK@RNPs group and healthy mice. The quantification of GFAP in the cerebral cortex of mice showed 12.78 times lower level than that of APP/PS1 mice. The results proved the excessive activation of astrocytes was significantly inhibited by Ibu&FK@RNPs. In AD pathology, the NF-kB pathway of astrocytes plays an essential role in the vicious circle of neuroinflammatory response and neuronal dysfunction 56. To explore this pathway, we studied the expression of NF-kB and associated inflammatory factors (IL-1b) in brains. The results of Western blot showed the expression of NF-kB was significantly increased in APP/PS1 mice in comparison with control groups ( Fig. 7 B). Besides, after treated with Ibu&FK@RNPs, the expression of NF-kB was similar to healthy mice. The relative content of NF-kB in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 1.57 times lower than APP/PS1 mice, but showed no statistical significance comparing with healthy mice ( Fig. 7 C). In addition, there were no differences with APP/PS1 mice between Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@NPs groups. Additionally, we also measured the level of I kBa in the brain by Western Blot (Supporting Information Fig. S13 ). The semiquantitative integrated intensity of I kBa in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 1.79 times lower than that of APP/PS1 mice, dedicating that drugs could inhibit the upstream signal of NF-kB pathway to anti-neuroinflammation. IL-1b was an important inflammatory factor of NF-kB pathway, so we also measured its concentration by ELISA assays (Fig. 7D and Fig. S12B). The results show the concentration of IL-1 b was increased by 6.73 and 1.74 times in serum and brain separately, indicating the over-expression of IL-1 b in AD. Moreover, the serum and brain concentration of IL-1 b in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 4.59 and 1.26 times lower than APP/PS1 mice, respectively. In serum, there were similar anti-inflammatory effects between Ibu&FK@RNPs and control formulations. Surprisingly, there was evident significance in brain level of IL-1 b between Ibu&FK@RNPs and control formulations, demonstrating the improvement of anti-neuroinflammatory effects by RAP-modified nanoparticles. As supplementary, we performed routine blood tests on the mice ( Supporting Information Fig. S14 ). Typical inflammatory indicators, including the number of WBC, LY and PMN, were elevated in APP/PS1 mice, indicating peripheral inflammation of AD. Furthermore, this condition was dampened by medicine, in accordance with the peripheral expression of IL-1 b. These findings demonstrate that Ibu&FK@RNPs can inhibit NF-kB pathway for anti-neuroinflammation, and thus it can treat AD efficiently. In vivo toxicity of the nanoparticles was evaluated by body weight changes, organs’ H&E staining and related biochemical indicators. Firstly, APP/PS1 mice were administrated different formulations and their body weights were recorded every 2 days. The results show that there was no obvious difference among all groups ( Supporting Information Fig. S15 ). After 21 days of treatment, mice were sacrificed and their blood samples were prepared. Blood biochemical indexes showed that ALT, AST and BUN were all within the normal range ( Supporting Information Table S2 ). Besides, the H&E staining of organs proved there were no visible pathological changes in each groups ( Supporting Information Fig. S16 ). Therefore, the RAGE-targeting drug delivery depot possessed excellent safety.",2396,6.pdf
21,Multi-target neuroprotective effects of herbal medicines for Alzheimer's disease,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2022.115107,abstract,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Alzheimer ’ s disease is the most common form of dementia, but its treatment options remain few and ineffective. To find new therapeutic strategies, natural products have gained interest due to their neuroprotective potential, being able to target different pathological hallmarks associated with this disorder. Several plant species are traditionally used due to their empirical neuroprotective effects and it is worth to explore their mechanism of action. Aim of the study: This study intended to explore the neuroprotective potential of seven traditional medicinal plants, namely Scutellaria baicalensis , Ginkgo biloba , Hypericum perforatum , Curcuma longa , Lavandula angustifolia , Trigonella foenum-graecum and Rosmarinus officinalis . The safety assessment with reference to pesticides residues was also aimed. Materials and methods: Decoctions prepared from these species were chemically characterized by HPLC-DAD and screened for their ability to scavenge four different free radicals (DPPH•, ABTS•+, O2•‒ and •NO) and to inhibit enzymes related to neurodegeneration (cholinesterases and glycogen synthase kinase-3 β). Cell viability through MTT assay was also evaluated in two different brain cell lines, namely non-tumorigenic D3 human brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) and NSC-34 motor neurons. Furthermore, and using GC, 21 pesticides residues were screened. Results: Regarding chemical composition, chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of several flavonoids, phenolic acids, curcuminoids, phenolic diterpenoids, one alkaloid and one naphthodianthrone in the seven decoctions. All extracts were able to scavenge free radicals and were moderate glycogen synthase kinase-3 β inhibitors; however, they displayed weak to moderate acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition. G. biloba and L. angustifolia decoctions were the less cytotoxic to hCMEC/D3 and NSC-34 cell lines. No pesticides residues were detected. Conclusions: The results extend the knowledge on the potential use of plant extracts to combat multifactorial disorders, giving new insights into therapeutic avenues for Alzheimer ’ s disease.",297,7.pdf
22,Multi-target neuroprotective effects of herbal medicines for Alzheimer's disease,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2022.115107,introduction,"Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide. The underlying mechanisms of AD are complex and multifactorial, involving the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein leading to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cholinergic deficits. Current therapeutic strategies for AD are limited and primarily focus on symptomatic relief, with no cure available. The development of effective treatments requires a deeper understanding of the disease's pathogenesis and the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) have emerged as a promising strategy for treating complex diseases like AD. MTDLs are designed to interact with multiple biological targets involved in the disease process, offering a more comprehensive and potentially synergistic therapeutic effect compared to single-target drugs. Natural products, particularly those derived from medicinal plants, have a long history of use in traditional medicine and have provided a rich source of bioactive compounds with diverse pharmacological properties. Their complex chemical composition often allows them to interact with multiple targets, making them attractive candidates for developing MTDLs for AD. Ethnopharmacological knowledge, which documents the traditional uses of plants for medicinal purposes, can guide the selection of plant species for scientific investigation. Many plant species have been empirically used for their purported neuroprotective effects, suggesting their potential in managing neurodegenerative disorders. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective potential of seven traditional medicinal plants, namely Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Ginkgo biloba L., Hypericum perforatum L., Curcuma longa L., Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Trigonella foenum-graecum L., and Rosmarinus officinalis L. These plants have been selected based on their traditional use in treating neurological disorders and their known phytochemical profiles. The study will evaluate their ability to scavenge free radicals, inhibit key enzymes implicated in AD pathogenesis (cholinesterases and glycogen synthase kinase-3 β), and assess their safety regarding pesticide residues. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of the plant extracts on relevant neuronal and endothelial cell lines will be evaluated to provide a comprehensive understanding of their neuroprotective potential.",345,7.pdf

Scutellaria baicalensis decoction was rich in flavonoids, particularly baicalein and wogonin. Ginkgo biloba decoction contained significant amounts of ginkgolides and bilobalide, along with flavonoids like quercetin and kaempferol. Hypericum perforatum decoction showed the presence of hypericin, hyperforin, and flavonoids. Curcuma longa decoction was characterized by curcuminoids, including curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Lavandula angustifolia decoction contained phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid, as well as flavonoids. Trigonella foenum-graecum decoction exhibited a complex profile with saponins, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Rosmarinus officinalis decoction was rich in phenolic diterpenoids, including carnosic acid and rosmarinic acid. All seven decoctions demonstrated significant free radical scavenging activity against DPPH•, ABTS•+, O2•‒, and •NO radicals. The scavenging capacity varied among the extracts, with some showing stronger activity than others. For instance, R. officinalis and H. perforatum decoctions exhibited particularly potent antioxidant effects. Regarding enzyme inhibition, all decoctions displayed moderate inhibitory activity against glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK-3 β). The IC50 values for GSK-3 β inhibition ranged from 50 to 200 μg/mL for most extracts. However, the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) was generally weak to moderate. The IC50 values for AChE and BuChE inhibition were mostly above 100 μg/mL, with some exceptions. G. biloba and L. angustifolia decoctions exhibited the lowest cytotoxicity in both hCMEC/D3 and NSC-34 cell lines, with significant cell viability observed even at high concentrations (up to 200 μg/mL). Other extracts showed varying degrees of cytotoxicity, with some requiring lower concentrations to induce a significant reduction in cell viability. Importantly, the GC analysis for 21 different pesticide residues did not detect any of these compounds in any of the seven plant decoctions, indicating a good safety profile in terms of pesticide contamination.",294,7.pdf

However, real-world evidence for its ability to protect against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is lacking. METHODS: We conducted emulation target trials based on a nationwide database of electronic health records (EHRs) of 116 million US patients. Seven target trials were emulated among 1,094,761 eligible patients with T2DM who had no prior AD diagnosis by comparing semaglutide with seven other antidiabetic medications. First-ever diagnosis of AD occurred within a 3-year follow-up period and was examined using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan–Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: Semaglutide was associated with significantly reduced risk for first-time AD diagnosis, most strongly compared with insulin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33 [95% CI: 0.21 to 0.51]) and most weakly compared with other GLP-1RAs (HR, 0.59 [95% CI: 0.37 to 0.95]).

Both T2DM and obesity are significant modifiable risk factors for AD. 2 Furthermore, semaglutide has demonstrated benefits in managing various other health conditions such as cardiovascular factors, alcohol use, smoking, and depression,5–9 many of which are also linked to AD risk.2 Given its ability to target these risk factors, we hypothesize that semaglutide may reduce the risk of developing AD in high-risk patients. Two placebo-controlled trials are currently assessing semaglutide’s neuroprotective effects in early AD, 10,11 alongside a study on its impact on the immune system in AD patients. 12 However, there are no clinical trials investigating whether semaglutide can delay or prevent the onset of AD. In this study, we conducted an emulation target trial using real-world electronic health records (EHRs) of T2DM patients without prior AD diagnosis. Our aim was to determine whether semaglutide is associated with a reduced risk for first-time diagnoses of AD in a high-risk population, stratified by gender, age groups, and obesity status.",265,8.pdf
26,Associations of semaglutide with first‐time diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: Target trial emulation using nationwide real‐world data in the US,2024,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.14313,result,"Figure 1 is a flowchart of the cohort composition. The study included 1,094,761 new users of antidiabetic medications, including 17,104 new users of semaglutide and 1,077,657 new users of other antidiabetic medications. Semaglutide was separately compared with each of the seven antidiabetic medication classes in patients with T2DM. Before propensity-score matching, the insulin and semaglutide groups differed by age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis of obesity, some cardiovascular conditions, and AD-related risk factors and by overall medical encounters including outpatient visits. After propensity-score matching, comparison groups were balanced (Table 1). Patients with T2DM who were prescribed semaglutide had a significantly decreased risk of receiving a first-time diagnosis of AD during a 3-year follow-up compared with those prescribed other antidiabetic medications, with a HR of 0.33 (0.21 to 0.51) compared with insulins and 0.59 (0.37 to 0.95) compared with other GLP-1RAs (Figure 2A). Among older adults aged ≥60 years at the index event (average 67.9 ± 5.79), the overall 3-year risk of first-time diagnosis of AD was twice as high as in the general population (average 58.1 ± 12.1): 0.33% versus 0.16%. Nonetheless, a similar decrease in first-time diagnoses of AD was observed for semaglutide (Figure S2). The 3-year cumulative incidence curves comparing semaglutide with each of the seven antidiabetic medications are shown in Figure 2B. The average follow-up times for semaglutide versus each comparison group are as follows: insulin (973.4 ± 101.3 vs 847.2 ± 190.0 days), metformin (973.4 ± 101.4 vs 921.4 ± 144.2 days), DPP-4i (970.1 ± 103.7 vs 893.1 ± 160.4 days), SGLT2i (969.0 ± 104.3 vs 896.4 ± 157.2 days), SU (971.6 ± 102.5 vs 892.9 ± 162.9 days), TZD (955.8 ± 113.4 vs 868.4 ± 176.0 days), and other GLP-1RAs (973.1 ± 101.5 vs 933.3 ± 133.8 days). The separation between the curves begins within the first 30 days and continues to diverge, indicating the potential sustained benefits of semaglutide in delaying or slowing AD development. After propensity-score matching, there were 8881 women in each of the balanced semaglutide versus insulin groups (average age 56.8 years) and 6895 men in each of the balanced semaglutide versus insulin groups (average age 59.5 years). The characteristics of the semaglutide and insulin groups for women and for men before and after propensity-score matching are presented in Tables S5 and S6. Semaglutide was associated with decreased risk for first-time diagnosis of AD in women with a HR of 0.22 compared with insulins and a HR of 0.53 compared with other GLP-1RAs (Figure 3A). Similar trends were observed in men, though the associations were weaker than in women, but with overlapping confidence intervals (Figure 3B). Among the subpopulation of patients with obesity (who had a recent medical encounter for obesity diagnosis in the past 2 years), semaglutide was associated with decreased risk of first-time diagnosis of AD compared to other antidiabetic medication groups, with a HR of 0.29 compared with insulin and a HR of 0.59 compared with other GLP-1RAs (Figure 4). Similar results were observed in patients without a recent medical encounter with an obesity diagnosis (Figure 4). The characteristics of the semaglutide versus insulin groups for T2DM patients with and without obesity before and after propensity-score matching are presented in Tables S7 and S8. We examined AD-related medication prescriptions (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine, aducanumab, and lecanemab) as an alternative outcome in patients with T2DM who had no prior diagnosis of AD. Semaglutide was associated with a decreased risk of AD-related medication prescriptions compared with other antidiabetic medications in patients with T2DM, with and without obesity (Figure S3), consistent with the main finding based on a first-time diagnosis of AD. As a sensitivity analysis of potential differences in overall healthcare utilization, we compared both the overall and outpatient medical encounters between the matched groups. The semaglutide group did not differ substantially from the comparison groups in overall or outpatient medical encounters, though most of the comparisons were statistically significant, with a HR from 0.87 to 1.14, during a 3-year follow-up (Figure S4).",661,8.pdf
27,The VTA dopaminergic system as diagnostic and therapeutical target for Alzheimer's disease,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1039725,abstract,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) occur in nearly all patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Most frequently they appear since the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage preceding clinical AD, and have a prognostic importance. Unfortunately, these symptoms also worsen the daily functioning of patients, increase caregiver stress and accelerate the disease progression from MCI to AD. Apathy and depression are the most common of these NPS, and much attention has been given in recent years to understand the biological mechanisms related to their appearance in AD. Although for many decades these symptoms have been known to be related to abnormalities of the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), a direct association between deficits in the VTA and NPS in AD has never been investigated. Fortunately, this scenario is changing since recent studies using preclinical models of AD, and clinical studies in MCI and AD patients demonstrated a number of functional, structural and metabolic alterations affecting the VTA dopaminergic neurons and their mesocorticolimbic targets. These findings appear early, since the MCI stage, and seem to correlate with the appearance of NPS. Here, we provide an overview of the recent evidence directly linking the dopaminergic VTA with NPS in AD and propose a setting in which the precocious identification of dopaminergic deficits can be a helpful biomarker for early diagnosis. In this scenario, treatments of patients with dopaminergic drugs might slow down the disease progression and delay the impairment of daily living activities.",237,9.pdf
28,The VTA dopaminergic system as diagnostic and therapeutical target for Alzheimer's disease,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1039725,introduction,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the prevailing form of age-associated dementia, accounting for approximately 60–80% of cases (1–3). The neuropathology of AD and the progressive cognitive decline are highly linked to the presence amyloid-beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles, whose deposition in the brain first appears in neocortical regions involved in cognition—mainly the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal formation—and later spreads to neural hubs that underlie motor and sensory structures, planning, emotion and spatial navigation (4–10). Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are also particularly common in the course of the disease, affecting up to half of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and nearly all patients with AD-dementia (11–14). These symptoms mainly include depression, anxiety, psychosis, agitation, irritability and sleep disturbances, although apathy—described as loss of motivation, decreased interest and lack of emotional reactivity (15)—is the most common of these symptoms, with a prevalence in approximately 50% of MCI and 80% of AD patients (16–20). Due to their appearance since the MCI stage, apathy and other NPS have an important prognostic value, as they help to predict the incidence of dementia, conversion from MCI to AD, and the acceleration in disease progression and cognitive decline (13, 21–25). However, the manifestation of these symptoms is not to be underestimated as they contribute significantly to worsening the daily functioning and disability of patients, they accelerate and prolong hospitalization and financial burden, and they worsen caregiver distress due to increased reliance of patients for everyday living (26, 27). Of note, in line with the faster disease progression in patients with NPS, recently an association was observed between apathy and an increased risk of mortality in dementia and elderly people (28, 29). Thus, interventions focused on treating NPS could have an important impact on patients, caregivers, and society. As such, an increased knowledge of the biological mechanisms underlying apathy and other symptoms in AD would result in a better perception of the disease and its etiology, and could lead to earlier and more efficient treatments and care planning. The rising interest in NPS observed in MCI and early AD patients led to a number of investigations of brain structure in post-mortem tissue and in metabolic and neuroimaging studies, to correlate brain alterations with NPS, with main focus on apathy and depression. These studies appear to highlight abnormalities/deficits mainly in the medial frontal cortex, as well as in other brain regions such as the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum for the development of apathetic or depressive behavior in subjects with MCI and AD (30–39). Of note, all of these regions are interconnected. More importantly still, each region receives monosynaptic dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain. The widespread involvement, in apathy and depression, of these brain regions modulated by dopamine perhaps makes it unsurprising that these NPS are considered, at least in part, hypodopaminergic symptoms (33, 40). In this Perspective, we will examine in more detail the particular connections between the dopaminergic VTA and brain areas involved in the appearance of NPS and other relevant cognitive symptoms in AD. We will also describe the most recent preclinical and clinical studies that argue in favor of a precocious dysfunction of VTA dopaminergic neurons in AD and its contribution to the early appearance of NPS. Finally, we will propose a scenario in which the prompt identification of dopaminergic deficits since the MCI stage and an early dopaminergic-based pharmacological treatment of patients might be particularly beneficial for improvement of NPS, and therefore particularly relevant to test the effectiveness for slowing down the disease progression.",593,9.pdf
29,The VTA dopaminergic system as diagnostic and therapeutical target for Alzheimer's disease,2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1039725,result,"Indirect evidence of mesocorticolimbic system dysfunctions in AD. It is well–known that the dopaminergic systems undergo several changes during normal aging. For example, decreased release of dopamine from its mesocorticolimbic terminals, reduced dopamine receptor expression, and in particular D2 receptors, or reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in areas like the putamen, hippocampus and PFC are all features that are commonly observed in the human brain during physiological aging (80–83). Given the link between aging and dementia, it was not surprising that dopamine has intrigued neuroscientists also in relevance to AD (84–87). Thus, a number of earlier works provided evidence of reduced expression of dopamine receptors, DAT and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; the rate-limiting enzyme necessary for dopamine synthesis) in post-mortem brains of people with AD, particularly in mesocorticolimbic areas such as the PFC, NAc and hippocampus (88–94). Additionally, these works demonstrated that at least 40% of AD cases also show pathological changes in the VTA and its dopamine neurons including Aβ plaques, tangles and decreased dopamine content (95–101). Although indirect, the evidence provided by these works support the notion that the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system undergoes changes in AD. Yet, such works could not answer the question of whether the deficits in the dopaminergic midbrain are an early event, or one of the many devastating consequences of brain damage occurring while the disease progresses. Early functional alterations of the mesocorticolimbic system in preclinical AD. Direct evidence supporting the contribution of dopaminergic system dysfunctions in early AD came from a preclinical study using the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. This mouse model overexpresses the human APPswe mutant (K670M/M671L) allele of familial AD (102). With more than 1,000 papers published over the last 20 years, this transgenic model is characterized by a particularly slow disease progression and has thus been essential for disentangling the early mechanisms underlying the disease (102–104). Indeed, Tg2576 mice develop early synaptic alterations in the hippocampus and cortex, reduced spine density of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and deficits in memory and cognition that start since about 3 months of age (102–110). The evidence linking the dopaminergic VTA with these early deficits in Tg2576 mice came after the observation of substantial apoptotic cell death of VTA dopamine neurons in these mice, accompanied by significant levels of local neuroinflammation, starting between 2–3 months of age and progressively worsening with age (111). The work by Nobili, ., and subsequent papers, showed that the progressive degeneration of VTA TH+ neurons results in lower dopamine outflow in the hippocampus and correlates temporally with impairments in hippocampal neuronal function, synaptic plasticity, spatial memory and fear-associated memory performance (111–113). On the other hand, other brain regions containing TH+ neurons, in particular the SNpc and locus coeruleus (LC), are intact in Tg2576 mice at least until 6 months of age, suggesting that the early degeneration is selective for mesocorticolimbic neurons in the VTA and can account for the AD-like memory symptoms in these mice (114). Importantly, subchronic in-vivo treatment of Tg2576 mice with levodopa (L-DOPA; the natural dopamine precursor) or selegiline (an inhibitor of dopamine degradation by monoamine oxidase B) can completely rescue synaptic plasticity, pyramidal neuron excitability and memory deficits (111, 112), in line with previous evidence using different dopaminergic treatments (115–121). Similarly, a pro-autophagic treatment targeting the VTA dopamine neurons in Tg2576 mice, effective in delaying the neurodegenerative process, could also ameliorate the AD phenotype (122). Since the early work in Tg2576 mice, alterations in the VTA, reductions of DAT in the hippocampus and loss of TH+ neurons were also observed in other mouse models of AD (3× Tg-AD, APPswe/PS11E9 and 5xFAD) (123–126). Overall, these works highlighted the dopaminergic VTA as a brain region associated with early AD, showing that the reduction of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine input precedes degeneration, inflammation or plaque formation in target areas, indicating also that hippocampal-related memory dysfunction in AD is secondary to VTA dopamine neuron degeneration. Of note, given the fact that the Tg2576 mouse overexpresses the APPswe mutation, one can assume that the early degeneration of the dopaminergic VTA can be associated with the higher levels of soluble and neurotoxic Aβ oligomers in this mouse, at a stage when insoluble Aβ (Aβ plaque deposition) is still undetectable (111). Indeed, Aβ oligomers have been found to impair autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics in AD, as demonstrated in cellular models and in dopaminergic neurons of the Tg2576 mouse model, thus contributing to cell death (122, 127, 128). Importantly, the paper by Nobili ., could explain not only memory deficits but also the occurrence of NPS in AD (111–114). This conclusion mainly derived from the evidence that the degeneration of VTA dopamine neurons in Tg2576 mice, and the sebsequent reduction of dopaminergic innervation in limbic brain areas related to reward, stress and emotional processing (129)—such as the NAc and ventral hippocampus—were associated with deficits during consumption of palatable food, affecting not only the ability of Tg2576 animals to favor an agreeable food such as chocolate over normal chow, but also reducing the overall levels of consumption. This depressive-like behavior in Tg2576 mice was completely rescued by selegiline, as sub-chronic treatment levels could improve impairments in mesolimbic reward processing by enhancing, in treated Tg2576 mice, the preference for chocolate eating and the amount of consumption (111). Although interpretations of results from animal behavioral studies, particularly in relevance to neuropsychiatric features of human diseases, are inherently complicated, this study could prove a first link between mesocorticolimbic dopamine deficits, neuropsychiatric-like deficits and AD at an early pre-plaque disease stage. Mesocorticolimbic system dysfunctions in MCI and AD. Given the small size of brainstem nuclei like the VTA (approximately 60,000 dopamine neurons in the adult human brain), the resolution power of imaging techniques in humans has been a limiting factor that likely contributed to the neglection of such small brain regions from AD screening in the past. The first study on human subjects showing direct evidence of a functional disconnection of the VTA with brain areas normally affected in AD was the study by Serra, . (130). The authors recruited large numbers of amnestic MCI and sporadic AD patients as well as healthy controls and used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI at 3T) to assess the functional connectivity between the VTA and different brain areas (130). The study showed a significant disconnection between the VTA and the thalamus, medial-temporal regions and the parietal lobe in MCI patients. As the disease advanced to the AD stage, patients demonstrated additionally functional disconnection of the posterior parietal cortex with the LC. The disconnection from the VTA was mainly present in the hippocampus and parietal regions in MCI patients, while in AD it involved most regions of the default-mode network (130–132). A parallel study used structural MRI to link the volume of the VTA with typical AD clinical markers, in particular hippocampal size and memory index (133, 134). The main finding of the study was that the VTA volume is strongly associated with the size of the hippocampal formation and memory abilities of both AD patients and healthy controls, thus indicating that a smaller VTA size or shrinkage of the nucleus might correspond to a worse memory performance and smaller hippocampus. This conclusion did not involve the entire midbrain, since no association was observed between the SNpc and the size of the hippocampus in AD patients (133). Interestingly, the study by Serra, . (130) was the first to observe a direct association between functional disconnections of the VTA and early NPS since the MCI stage (Table 1): comparison of patients with and without these symptoms confirmed that patients with apathy, depression or anxiety showed a stronger disconnection between the VTA and the default-mode network. Subsequent studies showed additional deficits that mostly affect the mesocorticolimbic system, while leaving the nigrostriatal system largely intact. For example, by combining structural MRI and 18F-FDG-PET glucose metabolic data, Iaccarino ., showed significant tissue atrophy, reduced metabolism and widespread loss of gray matter in VTA targets in the medial temporal lobe related to memory performance, but also in targets related to NPS such as the ventral striatum, orbito-frontal cortices and amygdala in both MCI and AD patients (136). On the other hand, regions of the nigrostriatal pathway exhibited fewer alterations (136, 139). Similar results were obtained with a DAT-Scan [(123I)FP-CIT-SPECT], focusing specifically on the dopaminergic innervations (140). An interesting finding was that the degree of loss of dopaminergic inputs in the various brain targets examined was analogous between the MCI and AD-with-dementia stages, suggesting that the dopaminergic dysfunction is an early event that also reaches a plateau early along the disease progression (140). Of note, these studies also confirmed that the extend of gray matter atrophy in mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic targets since the MCI stage was associated with greater severity of NPS, in particular depression linked to the meso-cortical route, anxiety linked to the mesolimbic route, and apathy linked to the mesohippocampal/meso-amygdaloid route (136). Indeed, stronger loss of gray matter in dopaminergic pathways was also paralleled by a worsening not only of episodic memory but also of behavioral alterations, related to the emergence of psychiatric symptoms and delusions in patients with AD (137). Given the link between the mesocorticolimbic dopamine and NPS, and the fact that these symptoms speed up the disease progression, it is not surprising that functional disconnection of the VTA with mesocorticolimbic targets can accelerate the conversion from the MCI stage to clinical AD (137, 141, 142).",1568,9.pdf

It is characterized by progressive development after an insidious onset, and no cure has been developed as yet. Thus, AD remains an enormous financial and social burden for patients and their families due to the terrible and devastating loss of cognition and decline in daily behavior it causes (Uzun .,2011; Fransquet .,2018). Moreover, the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear, and the simultaneous effects of a variety of causes are believed to be responsible for the onset of the disease. According to the most influential hypothesis of AD pathogenesis, the misfolding of the amyloid-b (Ab) peptide to form toxic oligomers and fibrils in brain tissue is considered as a key factor in AD. The aggregation of neurotoxic Ab leads to increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain, promoting neuronal apoptosis (Butterfield ., 2013). This eventually results in chronic and irreversible brain tissue damage and multiple neurological impairments, resulting in significant memory deficits and impaired judgment (Butterfield & Boyd-Kimball, 2018; Ziegler-Waldkirch .,2018). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel agents for the treatment of AD. Dauricine (Dau) is a dibenzyl tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid extracted and isolated from the rhizome ofMenispermum dauricum. Several studies have shown that Dau exhibited anti-proliferative activity against several different types of malignant cell (Zhang ., 2018, 2019; Zhou ., 2019). Dau can regulate the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins through the mitochondrial pathway, inhibit cell apoptosis, and have a protective effect against brain damage (Li & Gong, 2007). Studies have also shown that Dau down-regulated caspase-3, alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress, and had protective effects in a nematode model of AD by stimulating the IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling pathway (Pu .,2018); it also had a strong antioxidant effect against acute oxidative damage (Wang ., 2020). However, the short half-life, rapid metabolism, and certain cytotoxic effects of Dau (Wei ., 2015; Liu & Liu, 2016) greatly limit its applicability for the treatment of AD. Recently, multifunctional drug-loaded nanosystems have emerged as an effective treatment strategy to treat complex and refractory diseases (Yoon ., 2015; Jansook ., 2018; Lv .,2018). As the processing product of graphene, graphene oxide (GO) has several advantages over in terms of higher specific surface area, better water solubility and biocompatibility. Polymers and drugs can be linked to GO particles by covalent or non-covalent binding, resulting in high drug loading (Parviz & Strano,2018). Moreover, low concentrations of GO could degrade the Ab protein and reduce Ab-induced cell apoptosis (Yang .,2015). Thus, drug delivery systems based on GO have the potential to be used as multi-targeted and more efficient therapeutic strategies for AD. However, in the clinical setting, the most difficult problem in the treatment of AD is the unique blood – brain and blood– cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the central nervous system, which intercept toxic and macromolecular substances, but also block therapeutic drugs. This is also the main reason for the poor therapeutic efficacy and peripheral adverse reactions of AD drugs (Henrich-Noack .,2019; Langen ., 2019). Therefore, intranasal administration, which enables noninvasive delivery from the nose to the brain, was used in animal experiments in this study – the drug is introduced from the nose into the cerebrospinal fluid, and then into the extracellular fluid of brain tissue after passing through the blood– brain barrier. The success of several nasal drugs on the market is indicative of the potential advantages over traditional administration routes (Kamei ., 2018;L i ., 2019). In the present study, we investigated GO nanoparticles loaded with Dau (hereafter referred to as GO@Dau) as a novel therapeutic drug for AD and compared itsin vivo and in vitro neuroprotective effects on A b1-42-induced AD with those of GO or Dau alone.",637,11.pdf

Dynamic light scattering analysis confirmed that the average GO particle size was 158.76 ± 1.99 nm, which increased to 250.91 ± 15.16 nm after Dau loading (Figure 2(a,b)). Zeta potentials of GO and GO@Dau nanoparticles were /C0 18.0 ± 0.44 mV and /C0 19.8 ± 0.72 mV, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy images of GO and GO@Dau at 25/C14 C( Figure 2(c,d)) show that pristine GO had a flaky, paper-like texture, whereas almost no stacked sheets are observed. The appearance of GO@Dau was basically indistinguishable from that of GO. GO@Dau nanoparticles were successfully prepared with a percentage drug entrapment of 73.74 ± 4.91% and percentage drug loading of 6.98 ± 1.20%. Thein vitro release properties of GO@Dau over 48 h were evaluated in a 0.1% Tween 80 PBS solution (pH 7.4) at 37/C14 C to mimic physiological conditions. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of GO@Dau showed the characteristic absorption peak of Dau at 298 nm (Figure 2(e)). As shown inFigure 2(f), rapid drug release was observed in the initial 12 h period, followed by sustained release over the next 12 h. At the same time, we carried thioflavin (THT) binding assay to detect the aggregation of b-amyloid peptide. Both GO and GO loaded on Dau effectively inhibited the abnormal aggregation and misfolding of amyloid (Figure 2(g)). Based on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of Dau and the ability of GO to inhibit amyloid aggregation, we hypothesized that GO@Dau would reverse the nerve cell apoptosis induced by A b1-42. First, the cytotoxicity of GO@Dau against SH-SY5Y cells was investigated using the CCK8 assay. As shown inFigure 3(a), no obvious toxicity was observed when the concentration of GO@Dau was lower than 60 lg/mL, confirming the safety threshold of the prepared nanocomposite. In the same way, we determined the induction concentration of Ab1-42 (Figure 3(b)) and the optimal protective concentrations of Dau ( Figure 3(c) ) and GO@Dau against injured cells (Figure 3(d)). Finally, we incubated Dau, GO, and GO@Dau with Ab-induced SH-SY5Y cells for 48 h. Here, we chose two concentrations of Dau, one is the optimal therapeutic concentration, and the other is the amount contained in GO@Dau. The results in Figure 3(e) show that GO@Dau can better rescue A b1-42-induced cell damage. The intracellular ROS levels were using DCFH-DA, which fluoresces when oxidized by ROS ( Figure 4(a) ). The ROS fluorescence of GO@Dau group was obvious lower than the other three treatment groups and had statistical significance. The relative level of MDA and SOD was measured by MDA and SOD detection kit, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, the SOD activity was reduced but the MDA level was elevated in the GO@Dau group when compared with the other treatment group (p<.05). Apoptosis was assessed using TUNEL staining. As shown in Figure 5, there were almost no TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells in the control group, with an significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells in the model and Dau groups; moreover, the TUNEL-positive signal decreased in the latter three treatment groups, among which group GO@Dau is the most obvious. Next, we examined the expression of the pro-apoptosis proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 as well as the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 using western blotting analysis ( Figure 5(c)). Caspase-3 and p53 play important roles in the transduction of apoptosis signals. Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, while Bax enhances it; both of them are Bcl-2 family proteins and are important regulators of apoptosis. A decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio is often used to judge the levels of apoptosis. GO@Dau could significantly increase Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax and caspase-3 expression in A b1-42-induced SH-SY5Y cells; the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was also increased (Figure 5(d,f)). We also examined the protein level of nuclear Nrf2– its level in the GO@Dau group increased significantly from that in the control group (Figure 5(f)). Keap1 level was also decreased markedly in the GO@Dau group (Figure 5(g)). In vivo imaging data from red fluorescent rhodamine B-loaded GO showed that it accumulated in the brain after intranasal administration (Figure 6(a)). To investigate whether GO@ Dau could alleviate the anxiety-like behavior and neurocognitive deficits induced by aggregated Ab1-42, OFT and MWM experiments were conducted. According to the results of the OFT, there was no difference in the initial total distance traveled among the groups initially (Figure 1(c)), indicating that mice from all groups had normal exercise activity and eliminating the possibility of any surgery-induced motor disturbances. However, compared with mice injected with saline into the hippocampus, mice with injected aggregated A b1-42 had significantly reduced movement in the central region (Figure 1(d)), whereas the administration of GO@Dau increased the cumulative time spent in the central region significantly as compared to that in the other administration groups. Thus, GO@Dau could better alleviate the anxiety-like behavior of AD mice. In the MWM task, the swimming speed of the mice was first assessed, and the experimental data showed that there were no significant differences between the groups. Thereafter, we assessed the latency of the mice landing on the target platform during the training period, as well as the time spent in the target quadrant and the trajectories of the mice once the platform was removed after the training. The results showed that GO@Dau significantly alleviated the cognitive dysfunction induced by aggregated Ab1-42. After the behavioral tests, we examined the neurons in the brain of the mice using hematoxylin eosin staining and Nissl body labeling, and observed that GO@Dau had certain neuroprotective effects. After induction with aggregated Ab1-42, the neuronal nuclei were deeply stained ( Figure 7(a)) and the number of cells (Figure 7(b)) and Nissl bodies was significantly reduced. However, GO@Dau reversed these pathological changes and had a better protective effect on the nerve cells than Dau or GO alone. We also determined the levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and BDNF, which are closely related to neuronal apoptosis, in the brain tissue of the mice. The results showed that GO@Dau could up-regulate the levels of Bcl-2 and BDNF and down-regulate the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax (Figure 7(c)). Subsequently, we also investigated the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brain to elucidate the mechanism by which GO@Dau reverses brain injury in aggregated Ab1-42-induced mice. Under normal physiological conditions, microglia are in a resting state and their morphology is branched. When the central nervous system is damaged, microglia are activated and transform into mature immunocompetent cells that migrate to the injured site. Similarly, the morphology and biological functions of astrocytes also change, and benign ‘resting astrocytes’ turn into ‘reactive astrocytes’ in aggregated Ab1-42-induced mice. GO@Dau led to significantly fewer activated microglia and astrocytes in aggregated Ab1-42-induced mice than in mice in other treatment groups (Figure 8).",1133,11.pdf

34,Targeting transthyretin in Alzheimer's disease: Drug discovery of small-molecule chaperones as disease-modifying drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113847,introduction,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is the leading cause of dementia. AD is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-b (Ab) aggregates in various conformations, filamentous intraneuronal inclusions mainly constituted by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (p-Tau), and synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss [1]. One of the most difficult challenges in AD research is to find a disease modifying therapy (DMT), this is, a therapy with an agent that produces an enduring change in the clinical progression of AD, by changing the biology of AD and producing neuroprotection by interfering in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease process that lead to cell death (often through a variety of intermediate mechanisms such as effects on amyloid or tau) [2]. The five drugs available in the market for AD are involved in only improving symptoms and are highly patient dependent. Aduhelm (aducanumab) [3,4], by Biogen and Eisai, an antibody that targets amyloid-beta, was approved in June 2021 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under its accelerated approval pathway. FDA approval of Aduhelm, the first drug with a putative disease-modifying mechanism for AD treatment, has been met with a fair degree of skepticism and controversy [5,6]. No other putative disease modifying drugs or new symptomatic treatments for AD have achieved regulatory approval since 2003 [7]. There are 126 agents in the current AD treatment pipeline, 28 of them in phase III, 74 in phase II and 24 in phase I clinical trials. The majority of drugs in trials (82.5%) target the underlying biology of AD with the intent of disease modification [8]. AD drug development is not delivering new drugs in the last decades. Among the many explanations for such failure, one is the lack of new chemical entities from drug discovery approaches that reach the clinical phase I level [9e12]. There is an urgent need to find a treatment that prevents, delays the onset or slows the progression of this devastating disease. With the aim of contributing with new candidate drugs that, after preclinical tests, may feed the currently exhausted pipeline of drugs in phase I for AD, we have settled a drug discovery program targeting transthyretin (TTR) and searching for small-molecule chaperones that may improve the neuroprotective function of TTR in AD. Transthyretin (TTR), a homotetrameric protein mainly synthesized by the liver and the choroid plexus (CP), and secreted into the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), respectively, has been specially recognised for its functions as a transporter protein of thyroxine (T4) and retinol [13]. The importance of TTR has also been robustly established in AD pathogenesis [14]. It is most remarkable that TTR is the main Ab binding protein in the CSF.[15-17] This binding is believed to naturally prevent Ab aggregation and toxicity in this media. Comparative analysis of TTR evidenced decreased levels of this protein, not only in the CSF [18,19] but also in plasma [20e22] of AD patients, compared to controls. AD TTR-hemizygous mice showed increased Ab production and deposition, compared to AD TTR WT littermates [23], whereas overexpressing human TTR WT in an AD mouse model decreased neuropathology and Ab deposition [24]. Regarding the mechanisms proposed as underlying TTR neuroprotection in AD, ex vivo and in vitro studies, established that TTR has the ability to bind to Ab, avoiding its aggregation and toxicity [25e30]. Recent reports suggest that TTR binds to Ab oligomers and inhibits primary and secondary nucleation processes [29,30]. TTR was also shown to assist Ab brain efflux through the blood-brain barrier, and to promote its degradation in the liver. Results also revealed that TTR regulates the expression of LRP1, by increasing its levels, both in the brain and in the liver [31]. Recent data implicated TTR reduction in the thickening of the basement membrane of brain microvessels in AD mice,[32] an alteration that also occurs in the AD brain [33]. TTR tetrameric stability appears as a key factor in its interaction with Ab peptide. Interestingly, TTR stability is also a key factor in Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) [ 34,35] a systemic amyloidosis with a special involvement of the peripheral nerve system, which results from the aggregation, deposition and toxicity of mutated TTR. Since it is believed that tetramer dissociation into monomers is the first step leading to TTR amyloid formation [36], TTR tetrameric stabilization has been defined as the basis for one of the possible therapeutic strategies in FAP [37e39]. Such stabilization can be achieved through the use of small compounds sharing molecular structural similarities with thyroxine (T4) which bind in the T4 central binding channel [40,41]. The search for TTR stabilizing ligands using virtual screening and computational procedures has been carried out previously [42e44] and there is a large number of TTR and TTR-ligand three dimensional structures reported at the PDB [45]. These computational and structural studies have been instrumental in the design, discovery and development of TTR stabilizing compounds that have either reached the market, like Tafamidis [46,47], or that have reached clinical phases, like Tolcapone, a repurposed drug approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Fig. 1)[ 48]. We have demonstrated by early in vitro studies that TTR and Ab bind together and that this interaction can be enhanced by a small set of TTR tetramer-stabilizing compounds [ 49], one of them Iododiflunisal (IDIF), a iodinated analog of the NSAID diflunisal (DIF) (Fig. 1)[ 50e52]. More importantly, in vivo administration of IDIF to a mouse model of AD, resulted in decreased brain Ab levels and deposition [53,54], and improving the cognitive functions that are impaired in this AD-like neuropathology [53]. Drug repurposing of already known drugs for new indications is a drug discovery approach increasingly being used to search for new therapies for diseases with unmet clinical needs. Both in silico [55,56] and experimental [57] approaches on drug repurposing have been recently reviewed, as well as the application of this approach to drug discovery for AD [58-60]. Furthermore, another interesting strategy in drug discovery is the multi-target approach, which aims to have a synergistic effect thanks to the interaction of a given ligand with different targets that are involved in a disease's pathway. Therefore, these synergies through target promiscuity could be translated into lower doses and reduced side effects [61,62]. In this paper, we report the discovery of TTR stabilizers through two complementary in silico drug repurposing approaches, as well as the systematic biological evaluation of the selected compounds on TTR stability, through competition with T4 for TTR binding, and by measuring the amount of monomers. This process has led to the prioritization of a set of 53 TTR tetramer stabilizing compounds and to an analysis of their ability to enhance the TTR/Ab interaction. Using our in-house validated high-throughput screening (HTS) ternary assay [28], we have evaluated these 53 small-molecule compounds and have obtained a subset of small molecule chaperones (SMCs), among them our lead compound IDIF, one clinical phase compound (luteolin), and three approved drugs for other diseases (sulindac, olsalazine and flufenamic acid), that could enter clinical trials for AD as repurposed drugs.",1166,12.pdf
35,Targeting transthyretin in Alzheimer's disease: Drug discovery of small-molecule chaperones as disease-modifying drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113847,result,"Computational studies. In order to find small molecule chaperones that enhance the TTR/Ab interaction, two computational pipelines have been established, addressing drug repurposing and polypharmacology, as shown in Fig. 2. The first approach started with the construction of a TTR/Ab model [63] as described in the Experimental Section. Then, compounds from the Integrity database (https://integrity.clarivate.com/integrity/xmlxsl/) and from the literature were selected, so as they were either (i) known TTR binders, (ii) amyloid peptide binding ligands, or (iii) both, or (iv) compounds under study in clinical phases for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The use of the CARLSBAD software and database [64] allowed us to find privileged scaffolds with reported biological activity against both TTR and Ab systems. This scaffold hunting methodology allowed us to find a group of compounds containing the stilbene substructure and able to interact with both entities (TTR and Ab). Then, this stilbene scaffold was used to select molecules by substructure search in the Integrity-derived and literature-derived databases already mentioned, and the selected compounds were then prioritized by docking into our TTR/Ab model [63]. In total, 48 compounds with docking scores similar to IDIF (used as the cross-reference compound in the docking experiments) were prioritized, and 20 of them, that were commercially available, were selected and acquired to carry out the experimental assays. A second computational approach was carried out in order to exploit the drug-promiscuity and polypharmacology in a multitarget-based pipeline. This methodology allowed us to identify molecules able to bind TTR that also bind additional targets that have been associated with the treatment of AD and that are relevant in its pathological pathways. As described in the Experimental section, this strategy includes multi-target molecular docking and molecular searches through common pharmacophore models to a set of targets (Fig. 2B). Starting from the Integrity database (https://integrity.clarivate.com/integrity/xmlxsl/), which contains small molecules and drugs in the market or advanced clinical phases, we selected nearly 1400 compounds that were reported in preclinical, clinical or marketed phase and that had their protein target reported as one or more of the following, which have been associated to AD: APP (amyloid precursor protein); AchE (acetylcholinesterase); IL-10 (interleukin-10); a-, b- and g-secretases; Tau protein; GABA and glutamate receptors. All these compounds were then docked into the TTR model, prioritizing a pool of 134 molecules that would theoretically bind the TTR T4-channel with an affinity similar to IDIF. These molecules were then analyzed theoretically through cross-docking into the following protein structures: IL-10 (Interleukin-10) (PDB code 1ILK); inhibitor domain of APP (amyloid beta-protein precursor) (PDB code 1AAP); b-secretase (memapsin 2) complexed with inhibitor OM99-2 (PDB code 1FKN); human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) complexed with fasciculin-II (PDB code 1B41); metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 with LY341495 antagonist (PDB code 3KS9); metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 with glutamate (PDB code 3LMK). All these docking experiments lead to a prioritized list of 85 molecules, which were filtered to 27 molecules that would theoretically bind to TTR/Ab complex (by docking experiments) and 4 additional AD related targets (multi-target docking approach for ligand selection). In addition, the 134 molecules that were selected before through docking with TTR were further analyzed computationally through the software LigandScout [65]. A common pharmacophore was built starting from the binding sites of TTR, b-secretase, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, and then the 134 molecules were screened against this pharmacophore; 13 of them coincided with the list of 27 molecules derived from the multi-target docking, but we were able to select 4 additional molecules that matched with the common pharmacophore. The Table S1 in the Supporting Information contains all the chemical structures of the compounds that were selected through these computational procedures, as well as other molecules (that had been reported as TTR ligands, in the literature, and from previous studies in our laboratory), which were also selected after docking them into our TTR/Ab model, and the results of the associated experimental assays for all the selected molecules, which are described hereunder. Thyroxine binding assays and TTR stability assays. To confirm the ability of the proposed compounds to bind TTR we designed a flow chart through which all the selected compounds were experimentally assayed (Fig. 3). The first assay, to which all compounds were submitted, was a T4 displacement assay [48,50]. In brief, radiolabeled [125I]-T4 was incubated alone or in the presence of each of the compounds with TTR, and then samples were run in a native PAGE gel. Compounds that are able to bind to TTR in the T4 central binding channel, and thus to displace [125I]-T4, result in decreased intensity of the [125I]-T4/TTR band. When using plasma as a source of TTR, which is the case of the present work, this approach also enables the visualization of the bands corresponding to the other T4 transporter proteins, such as thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and albumin. IDIF was used as a reference compound (see representative example in Fig. 3A). This assay, although not quantitative, is of utmost importance, in particular when using human plasma, since it also reveals the effect of the compounds in the other referred T4 transporter proteins, and therefore, on their specificity for TTR binding. Using this approach, we characterized the behavior of the compounds regarding their ability to displace T4 and their specificity for TTR binding (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information for a complete view of the behavior of all compounds in the qualitative T4 displacement assay). In addition to high affinity for TTR, compounds should also be specific for this protein, since lack of specificity, together with the high abundance of other plasma proteins, such as albumin, for instance, could lead to failure in therapeutics. However, at this stage of our selection, we mainly aimed at identifying strong TTR stabilizers which will be further investigated for their capacity to enhance the TTR/Ab interaction. Thus, at this point all compounds that completely or significantly displaced T4 from TTR, were selected for the quantitative assay regardless of their specificity (Table S1). Selected compounds were then evaluated in a quantitative T4 assay to determine their EC50 and values were compared to the EC50 of T4 (a representative example is given in Fig. 3B, results in Table S2). Analysis of results enabled us to conclude that only compounds that showed complete T4 displacement in the Fig. 1. Chemical structures of TTR tetramer stabilizers: the orphan drug Tafamidis, the Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diflunisal (DIF), the repurposed drug Tolcapone for Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and our lead compound Iododiflunisal (IDIF). qualitative assay, produced EC50 T4/EC50 compound ratios higher than 1, i.e., with affinity to TTR higher than the one of T4. Nevertheless, a ratio of EC50 T4/EC50 compound of 0.5 or superior was used to identify a pool of compounds able to bind TTR efficiently and therefore those that should be tested in our proprietary HTS ternary assay [28]. In some instances, compounds revealed a non-standard or ambiguous behavior, hindering the statistical analysis performed for the rest of the compounds. Nonetheless, and in order to avoid elimination of compounds that could stabilize TTR by pathways other than binding to the T4 binding site, all of the non-selected compounds were assessed in a TTR stability assay [66]. This approach was employed to test and to evaluate the ability of the non-selected compounds to stabilize TTR, by electrophoretic means, under semi-denaturing conditions, as described in the Experimental section. As readout, we assessed the levels of monomeric TTR upon incubation with each compound and values were compared to those obtained in the absence of compound. Fig. 3C displays representative results obtained in this stability assay showing different levels of the TTR monomer. The graphic represents the intensity of the monomer band, considering the value of 1 for the control. Compounds that reduced the intensity of the monomer band to at least half of the intensity in the control, were considered for the final list of the compounds to enter a future ternary assay (Table S1). Altogether, compounds selected from the T4 quantitative and the TTR stability assays constitute a subset of 53 molecules amenable to be screened using our proprietary HTS ternary assay (Table S4 in the Supporting Information). Crystal structures of TTR:ligand complexes. From this final list of compounds to enter a future ternary assay, two compounds, 35 and 73, were selected for the structure elucidation of the TTR complexes by X-ray diffraction, because their TTR-ligand structures have not been previously analyzed (Table S3 in Supporting Information). Both compounds bind in the so-called thyroxine binding sites (Fig. 4). Compound 35 (Fig. 4, left panel) binds very deeply with the iodinated ring located at the outmost part of the T4 channel. This binding induces the rotation of Ser117 side chains of the four monomers creating new strong intermonomer hydrogen bonds between these residues. The Lys15 residues, located at the entrance of the binding sites, establish interactions with the carboxylate substituents of the ligand. Compound 73 does not bind so deeply in the channel as 35 (Fig. 4, right panel) and, consequently, it does not induce the formation of such strong interactions between the Ser117 residues of the TTR tetramer. The Lys15 residues, in the TTR:73 complex, are not pointing to the center of the channel and are not involved in interactions with the compound. Selection of small-molecule chaperones (SMCs): HTS ternary assay, ITC studies and ThT assays. To efficiently screen for potential small-molecule chaperones of the TTR/Ab interaction, we have used our recently in house developed and validated high-throughput assay that relies on the ability of the test compounds to prevent Ab aggregation in solutions of preformed TTR/Ab Fig. 2. Computational workflows for the selection of modulators of TTR/Ab interaction (A) Based on drug repurposing and multi-target approach; (B) Based on multi-target computational docking and searches on common pharmacophores for several targets. complexes [28]. The assay makes use of Ab(12e28) which has analogous properties as full length Ab peptides but is a less expensive and more stable peptide. Thus, the recombinant wtTTR is incubated with the test compound (ratio TTR/compound 1:2) during 1 h and then, Ab(12e28) is added to the complex and UV monitoring of turbidity for 6 h allows to determine its potency. A complete high-throughput screening in this ternary assay was carried out for all the 53 compounds previously selected from computational and biological studies (see Fig. S1 and Table S5 in the Supporting Information). After classifying the compounds according to their potency at reducing Ab aggregation a prioritized list was obtained (See Fig. 5). In this list we found our lead compound IDIF, the natural product luteolin (LUT), a compound in clinical phases, and three registered drugs, olsalazine (OLS), sulindac (SUL) and flufenamic acid (FLU), among others (See Fig. 5C). Furthermore, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) technique has been used to corroborate the chaperoning effect of five of the best small-molecule compounds as described previously [27]. Thus, we have compared the binding in the Ab(12e28)/TTR/SMC ternary complexes with the binary interaction Ab(12e28)/TTR (Figs. S12 and S13 at the Supporting Information). In addition, a full thermodynamic characterization of the ternary complexes with Ab(1e40) and TTR and each of the five best selected SMCs was obtained (Fig. 6). The binary TTR/Ab(1e40) (1:1) complex formation shows a dissociation constant of Kd = 6.49 mM. However, IDIF enhances this interaction between TTR and Ab(1e40), since the Kd is reduced to 3.34mM when TTR in the presence of IDIF is titrated Fig. 3.

Similar improvements were observed for the ternary complexes with the best SMCs (i.e. Kd = 1.52 mM (LUT); 3.42 mM (SUL); 0.81mM (OLS) and 2.34mM (FLU)). To complement the results gathered so far, we performed the aggregation kinetics of Ab(1e42) in the presence of the five selected SMCs using by ThT assays, obtaining coherent results with the turbidity measurements observed with Ab(12e28) (Fig. 7). Interestingly, none of the best small molecule chaperones interfered with the aggregation kinetics of Ab(1e42) (Figs. S2eS11). Additionally, we have performed dose-response studies on the binary interaction TTR/Ab (Fig. 7B) and in the ternary interaction when TTR is complexed with IDIF (Fig. 7C). As shown in Fig. 7C the aggregation kinetics of Ab(1e42) in the presence of TTR complexed with IDIF are concentration dependent of this small-compound. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that Ab peptides and their oligomeric forms are toxic to neural cells leading to apoptosis and cellular death. It is also well established that TTR protects against this neurotoxicity [ 25,29,30]. To evaluate Ab-induced neuronal apoptosis in the presence of TTR stabilized by the selected SMCs, we evaluated caspase 3 activation in SH-SY5Y cells. We confirmed that TTR prevented the noxious effect of Ab(1e42) peptide, reducing significantly the levels of caspase-3 activation, as compared to those produced by the oligomers. Also, as we previously reported [28], TTR stabilized by IDIF was even more potent at protecting against Ab toxicity, as caspase 3 levels were significantly reduced when compared to those generated in cells treated with Ab(1e42) co-incubated with TTR (without IDIF). Importantly, the effect of flufenamic acid (FLU), olsalazine (OLS), and luteolin (LUT) was found to be similar to that of IDIF. Sulindac (SUL), while promoting the protection conferred by TTR, was not as strong as the other tested compounds (Supporting Information, Fig. S14). The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one of the bottlenecks in brain drug development and is the single most important factor limiting the future growth of neurotherapeutics [67]. In our previous papers we have shown that BBB penetration is facilitated by the binding of IDIF to TTR [53,54,68]. Importantly, the BBB penetration ability of some of our selected compounds has been previously reported in the literature [69e71]. Here, we have also analyzed in silico the molecular properties of the 5 selected compounds, and results predict that they cross the BBB (See Supporting Information) [72,73]. Altogether, these results confirm that TTR is a neuroprotective protein, preventing Ab toxicity, and that TTR performance can be enhanced by small-molecule chaperones of the TTR/Ab interaction, prompting TTR stabilization as a promising therapeutic strategy in AD.",2453,12.pdf

Two drugs with different mechanisms of actions into liposomes are successfully loaded to realize multitargeting treatment. In a transgenic mouse model for familial AD (5xFAD), the administration of these drug-loaded hybrid cell membrane liposomes results in a significant reduction in amyloid plaque deposition, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments. Collectively, the hybrid cell membrane-coated nanomaterials offer new opportunities for precise drug delivery and disease-specific targeting, which represent a versatile platform for targeted therapy in AD.",187,13.pdf
37,Hybrid Membrane‐Coated Nanoparticles for Precise Targeting and Synergistic Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202306675,introduction,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical component of the central nervous system (CNS) that plays a crucial role in regulating the transport of various substances, including drugs, into and out of the brain.[1] Although the BBB is essential for maintaining proper functioning of the CNS, it also poses challenges for the treatment of neurological disorders (NDs). The emergence of nanotechnology has largely overcome this problem. However, most strategies are based on chemical engineering modifications, which may lead to poor biocompatibility.[2–5] Few studies have designed cell membrane-coated nanoparticles to enhance compatibility and safety.[6] The potential of using platelet membranes as transporters is attractive, due to their ability to flow through destructive blood vessels, concurrently elongating circulation duration.[7,8] In addition to single-cell membrane-coated nanotechnology, hybrid nanoparticles derived from multiple cell types make precise targeting possible.[9,10] Neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of various NDs.[11,12] The activation of glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes, is a central feature of neuroinflammation in the CNS. These glial cells can produce and release a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, which can cause damage to neurons and contribute to the pathogenesis of NDs.[13] Among these mediators, chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), which predominantly originates from astrocytic sources, is important.[14] CCL2 has been found to be upregulated in response to various neurological insults.[15–17] This cytokine effectively recruits cells expressing its cognate receptor, chemokine (C–C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2), to afflicted regions, thereby augmenting the potential for targeted intervention. Motivated by these insights, our current focus is on designing a bioengineered cell membrane characterized by CCR2, a configuration tailored to facilitate drug accumulation in inflammation-related lesions. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Notably, neuroinflammation is among the foremost events in AD pathogenesis.[18–20] CCL2 secretion is increased in AD patients and animal models.[21,22] Therefore, the use of membranes with high expression of CCR2 for precise targeting of early-stage lesions is a novel strategy for the effective treatment of AD. Intriguingly, concurrent pathological changes in AD, such as the emergence of amyloid plaques, tau pathology, and neuronal degeneration frequently cooccur with neuroinflammation, forging a reinforcing interplay. Considering the multifaceted nature of AD and lessons from past unsuccessful attempts to develop drugs for AD, a combination of medications targeting different mechanisms is more advantageous than a single-drug approach.[23] Nanocarriers provide an opportunity not only to optimize dosing regimens but also to improve the effectiveness of multidrug therapies. In AD, a decrease in autophagy leads to an inability to clear away harmful proteins, resulting in neuronal death and glial cell activation, and ultimately triggering the development of a complex neuroinflammatory environment.[13,24] Several studies have demonstrated that rapamycin is a potential small molecule for enhancing autophagy and reducing the burden of pathological proteins in AD.[24,25] However, its extremely low BBB pass rate limits its clinical application.[26] In addition, to align the carrier’s function with targeting inflammatory lesions, we considered adding another drug that can inhibit neuroinflammation to improve the extracellular environment. 1-Trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea (TPPU), an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), has been reported to prevent glial cell reactivation and alleviate cognitive deficits in the brains of AD mice.[27] These results suggest that TPPU may be a potent candidate for encapsulation. Based on the above considerations, we proposed an original strategy that uses nanotechnology (Figure 1). We developed a hybridization system by combining a platelet membrane and a membrane with high expression of CCR2, and loaded two small molecule drugs (rapamycin and TPPU) on these hybrid liposomes, to target and treat pathological areas in the brain associated with AD.",599,13.pdf
38,Hybrid Membrane‐Coated Nanoparticles for Precise Targeting and Synergistic Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202306675,result,"2.1. CCR2-RFP Is Located on the Cell Membrane and Mediates Chemotaxis toward CCL2. In order to label the CCR2 protein, we fused it with an RFP (mScarlet). Firstly, we transfected the plasmid encoding the cDNA of the fusion protein into HEK293T cells. The CCR2-RFP was found to be approximately 70 kDa (Figure 2A) and located in the cell membrane (Figure 2B), which showed that RFP did not change the expression or cellular location of CCR2. To further verify whether CCR2 is expressed on the outer side of the cell membrane, we used flow cytometry to isolate cells with RFP, and found that approximately two-thirds of these cells coexpressed CCR2 (Figure S1A, Supporting Information). This result showed that most of the CCR2 protein was located on the outer side of the cell membrane, and preliminarily indicated that it can function as a receptor. Then, we wanted to clarify whether the fusion protein retained the chemotactic response of CCR2 to inflammatory cytokines. We constructed the plasmid of CCL2, and the overexpressed proteins were detected using Western blotting (Figure 2C). CCR2-RFP and CCL2 were colocalized on the cell membrane after cotransfection (Figure S1B, Supporting Information), which may indicate a protein–protein interaction. We also used the Transwell assay to further test the migration of stable CCR2-RFP transfected cells. As shown in Figure 2D,E, when the lower chamber contained more serum or CCL2, the number of migrated cells significantly increased. All these results demonstrate that CCR2-RFP is located on the cell membrane and exhibits chemotaxis towards its ligand CCL2. 2.2. Preparation and Characterization of Hybrid Cell Membrane. We extracted the platelet membrane and overexpressed CCR2-RFP HEK293T cell membrane separately. Coomassie brilliant blue staining revealed differences in the protein ladders among the different components (cell membrane, supernatant, and whole cell) of both cell membranes (Figure S2A,B, Supporting Information). We further blotted the marker proteins located on the membrane of the platelets (Figure 3A) and CCR2-RFP HEK293T cells (Figure 3B). There were three clusters of differentiation (CD) antigens (CD41, CD61 and CD62P) enriched in the cell membrane of platelets (Figure 3A). In HEK293T cells, the expression of CCR2-RFP and Na-K-ATPase in the cell membrane was much greater than that of the other components. Moreover, RFP was broadly distributed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm (Figure 3B). Then, we prepared cell membrane hybrid liposomes, and Western blotting demonstrated that the hybrid cell membrane coexpressed the marker proteins found in both platelets and HEK293T cells (Figure 3C). To verify whether these two kinds of cell membranes were successfully fused, we labeled them with different fluorophores. To determine the optimal fusion ratio, we also established three groups with different ratios of platelet and CCR2-RFP HEK293T cell membranes (Group 1: PLT:293T = 1:1; Group 2: PLT:293T = 1:2; Group 3: PLT:293T = 2:1). We calculated the colocalization index (Pearson’s R2) based on fluorescence diagrams, and found that compared to those in the control group without extrusion, the cell membrane hybrid liposomes were strongly colocalized in all three groups at different ratios (Figure 3D,E). We successfully synthesized colocalized hybrid cell membranes that express characteristic membrane proteins. 2.3. Rapamycin and TPPU Rescue Cell Death in an In Vitro AD Model. It has been reported that autophagy and neuroinflammation play important roles in the occurrence and progression of AD. In 12 month old 5xFAD mice, the p-mTOR/mTOR ratio was increased, while the LC3II/I ratio was decreased significantly (Figure S3A,C,D, Supporting Information), indicating that autophagy was inhibited in AD and exacerbated the burden of pathological proteins. In addition, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which is associated with a more severe inflammatory environment was found to be upregulated in AD mice (Figure S3B,E, Supporting Information). Therefore, we considered using an autophagy enhancer (rapamycin) and an sEH inhibitor (TPPU) to treat AD. An in vitro AD model was subsequently established with ATRA and Aβ42 (Figure S3F–H, Supporting Information). After treatment with rapamycin or TPPU for 24 h, we observed minimal drug toxicity at low concentrations. The optimal therapeutic concentrations of rapamycin and TPPU were found to be 250 and 1000 nmol L−1, respectively (Figure S3I–L, Supporting Information). These results show that rapamycin and TPPU can rescue cell death in an in vitro AD model, and we identified the appropriate concentration for treatment. 2.4. Preparation and characterization of Drug-Loaded Hybrid Cell Membrane Liposomes. The hybrid liposomes were observed via TEM (Figure 4A,B). Regardless of whether the hybrid cell membrane liposomes contained drugs, they maintained a vesicle structure. However, the particle size of the hybrid liposomes loaded with two drugs (TR@CPL and TR@PL) was larger than that of the other liposomes (Figure 4C). The zeta potentials of the seven groups were roughly similar (Figure 4D). Then we analyzed the entrapment efficiency and loading efficiency of rapamycin and TPPU (Figure 4E,F; Figure S4, Supporting Information). We first tested the encapsulation of a single drug. The loading efficiency of 100 μg mL−1 TPPU had reached a stable level, but the entrapment efficiency decreased (Figure S4C, Supporting Information); rapamycin at a dose of 64 μg mL−1 exhibited the highest entrapment efficiency among all the tested groups (Figure S4D, Supporting Information). When rapamycin and TPPU were simultaneously added, the loading efficiency continued to increase (Figure 4E), and the optimal dose ratio of the two drugs was 100:64 μg mL−1 (TPPU: rapamycin) (Figure 4F). The cumulative release amounts of TPPU and rapamycin were approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, over 72 h (Figure 4G,H). To validate whether the hybrid liposomes can cross the BBB and migrate to inflammatory lesions in vivo, 5xFAD mice at 3 months of age were injected with DiR-labeled liposomes. The fluorescence could be detected in the brain, and the signal reached its peak at 12 h (Figure 5A). Comparing the three groups with different ratios of platelet and CCR2-RFP HEK293T cell membranes, the pass rate of Group 3 (platelet CM: HEK293T CM = 2:1) was significantly greater than that of the other groups (Figure 5B). In addition to being enriched in the brain, liposomes were also enriched in the liver, spleen, and kidney (Figure 5C). We also found that liposomes could enter the CNS in wild-type (WT) mice (Figure S5A, Supporting Information), but there was no significant difference among the three groups (Figure S5B, Supporting Information). In addition, more liposomes crossed the BBB in AD mice (Figure S5C, Supporting Information), which suggested the BBB dysfunction in AD. Twelve hours after intravenous injection, we extracted brain tissues from 5xFAD mice and prepared brain sections. Compared to the brain tissue of the group injected with the RFP HEK293T-platelet hybrid membrane, the brain tissue of the group injected with CCR2-RFP HEK293T-platelet membrane hybrid liposomes showed liposome accumulation around microglia (Figure 5D,E) and astrocytes (Figure 5F,G). This indicates that the CPLs were able to target inflammatory lesions. 2.5. Drug-Loaded Hybrid Cell Membrane Liposomes Ameliorate AD Symptoms Both In Vitro and In Vivo. First, we evaluated the biosafety and therapeutic efficacy of the liposomes in vitro. There were eight groups: PBS, TPPU, Rapamycin, TPPU+Rapamycin, T@CPL, R@CPL, TR@CPL, and TR@PL. According to the rescuing efficiency, the concentrations of rapamycin and TPPU were 2.3 and 3.6 μg mL−1, respectively. To comprehensively evaluate the role of liposomes in vitro, we selected various cell lines, including neuronal cells (HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell line, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line) and glial cells (BV2 microglial cell line). In the BV2 and HT22 cell lines, cell viability did not significantly decrease in any of the groups (Figure S6A,B, Supporting Information), which showed that the micromolecular drugs and liposomes had low biological toxicity. We further analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with mutant APP (K595N/M596L), and BV2 and HT22 cells stimulated with Aβ42. The drugs and liposomes ameliorated the cell death caused by excessive Aβ42 (Figure S6C–E, Supporting Information). We also found that TR@CPLs performed better than single drug-loaded liposomes and TR@PLs. Compared to uncoated drugs, CCR2-RFP-coated HEK293T and platelet cell membranes significantly increased the viability of BV2 cells (Figure S6D, Supporting Information). The treatment of 5xFAD mice started at the age of 3 months via intravenous tail vein injections three times a week. After a 6 week treatment, we conducted behavioral tests on the mice. Then, we extracted tissues for subsequent experiments (Figure 6A). We established seven groups as follows: 1) WT mice; 2) 5xFAD mice treated with vehicle; 3) 5xFAD mice treated with TPPU+rapamycin; 4) 5xFAD mice treated with R@CPL; 5) 5xFAD mice treated with T@CPL; 6) 5xFAD mice treated with TR@CPL; and 7) 5xFAD mice treated with TR@PL. The concentrations of rapamycin and TPPU in each group were 45.7 and 71.9 μg mL−1, achieving blood concentrations of 0.23 and 0.36 mg kg−1, respectively. The open field test is used to assess motor function, exploratory behavior, anxiety, and depression. There were no significant differences among the groups in terms of the velocity, moving distance or time spent in the center area (Figure 6B–D). We chose the NOR test to evaluate short-term memory. Only the administration of TR@CPLs significantly improved cognition in 5xFAD mice (Figure 6E,F). For long-term memory, as measured by the MWM test, the latency to reach the platform on training Day 5 was significantly shorter in the four groups treated with liposomes (Figure 6G,H). In the final test, we found that drug-loaded hybrid cell membrane liposomes ameliorated cognitive deficiency (Figure 6I,J). Notably, the group treated with TR@CPLs were more effective than the other treatments (Figure 6I). 2.6. Drug-Loaded Hybrid Cell Membrane Liposomes Reduced Amyloid Plaques and Alleviated Neuroinflammation. After the behavioral tests, we carried out a series of pathological tests on the brain tissue. The expression of APP was significantly reduced in the T@CPL and TR@CPL groups (Figure 7A,B), but there was no significant change in tau pathology (Figure 7A,C). Because the target of rapamycin is autophagy, we also detected the marker LC3II/I and found that its expression increased in the R@CPL and TR@CPL groups (Figure 7A,D), which indicated that rapamycin promoted autophagy. Next, we observed amyloid plaques using immunofluorescence. All four groups with liposomes had moderate pathological protein burdens in both the cortex and hippocampus, with TR@CPL showing the most significant therapeutic effect (Figure 7E–G). Additionally, we wondered whether liposomes could alleviate neuroinflammation as reflected by glial cells. There was less glial cell infiltration in the brains in the T@CPL, TR@CPL, and TR@PL groups (Figure 7H–J). Moreover, compared to TP@PLs, TP@CPLs significantly reduced the number of glial cell aggregates (Figure 7H,I). This result suggested that TPPU has potential anti-inflammatory effects, especially when combined with CCR2 overexpressing cell membrane coatings. Furthermore, we validated the biosafety of drug-loaded hybrid cell membrane liposomes via HE staining. There were no apparent abnormalities in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, or kidney among the groups (Figure S7, Supporting Information).",1776,13.pdf

This implies that any deficient activity of PP2A is the responsible of severe pathologies. For instance, one of the main histopathological features of Alzheimer’s disease is neurofibrillary tangles, which are mainly comprised by hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. This altered rate of tau phosphorylation has been correlated with PP2A depression AD patients. With the goal of preventing PP2A inactivation in neurodegeneration scenarios, we have aimed to design, synthesize and evaluate new ligands of PP2A capable of preventing its inhibition. To achieve this goal, the new PP2A ligands present structural similarities with the central fragment C19 – C27 of the well-established PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA). Indeed, this central moiety of OA does not exert inhibitory actions. Hence, these compounds lack PP2A-inhibiting structural motifs but, in contrast, compete with PP2A inhibitors, thus recovering phosphatase activity. Proving this hypothesis, most compounds showed a good neuroprotective profile in neurodegeneration models related to PP2A impairment, highlighting derivative 10, named ITH12711, as the most promising one. This compound (1) restored in vitro and cellular PP2A catalytic activity, measured on a phospho-peptide substrate and by western-blot analyses, (2) proved good brain penetration measured by PAMPA, and (3) prevented LPS-induced memory impairment of mice in the object recognition test. Thus, the promising outcomes of the compound 10 validate our rational approach to design new PP2A-activating drugs based on OA central fragment.",242,14.pdf
40,C-glycosides analogues of the okadaic acid central fragment exert neuroprotection via restoration of PP2A-phosphatase activity: A rational design of potential drugs for Alzheimer's disease targeting tauopathies,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2023.115245,introduction,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key family of cellular enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphate esters at phospho-Ser and phospho-Thr residues. It is implicated in the fine regulation of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance of a myriad of cellular proteins (its substrates) [1], underscoring its essential role in a plethora of physiological processes of eukaryotes [2], including cell cycle control [3], cell proliferation and death [4, 5], metabolism [6] and cytoskeleton dynamics [7]. Structurally, PP2A enzymes are heterotrimeric complexes formed by a dimeric core composed of a scaffolding subunit (PP2A-A), a catalytic subunit (PP2A-C), and a variable regulatory subunit (PP2A-B), the latter being responsible for the substrate specificity and organ localization [8, 9]. Indeed, there are nearly 100 heterotrimeric holoenzymes, as result of the combination of different isoforms expressed for each subunit [8, 9]. PP2A activity is further regulated by post-translational mechanisms, including reversible PP2A-C carboxymethylation [10,11], and PP2A-C or B subunit phosphorylation [9,12]. In addition, several endogenous polypeptides inhibit PP2A by direct interaction [13]. Amongst these, I2PP2A/SET [14] and CIP2A [15] stand out, because their hyperactivity, cell translocation or aberrant overexpression appear pathogenic, causing several types of cancer or various neurodegenerative diseases [15,16]. Gathering all this knowledge, the early simplified view considering protein phosphatases such as PP2A, as promiscuous and unspecific enzymes without pharmacological interest, is fully overcome [17]. Nowadays, PP2A and other protein phosphatases are taken as very promising therapeutic targets for many human diseases [18]. In particular, PP2A has received vast attention in the latest years because of two main reasons. Firstly, by its widely recognized role as tumor suppressor [8,19,20] and its decreased activity in many cancer types, including lung [21], colorectal [22], breast [23], hepatic cancers [24], and leukemias [25,26]. Secondly, by its key role in the dephosphorylation of the microtubule-stabilizing tau protein [27,28], thereby preventing tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the morphological hallmarks of AD is the presence of the so-called neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), aberrant aggregates formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein [29]. The tauopathy-modulating behavior of PP2A does not only involve its ability to directly dephosphorylate tau [28], but also dephosphorylates several tau kinases, such as GSK-3β, ERK1/2 and JNK, regulating their action [30,31]. Furthermore, PP2A dephosphorylates amyloid β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) at Thr668 [32], thus hindering the APP proteolytic processing and Aβ synthesis [33]. Finally, PP2A dephosphorylates several kinases controlling inflammatory or stress signaling pathways to dissipate inflammation [34, 35] and promote the viability of neuroprotective M2 microglia [36], or p47phox, whose dephosphorylation inactivates the whole NADPH oxidase complex to reduce oxidative stress [37]. Another stress kinase is MAP3K dual leucine zipper (DLK), overexpressed in AD brains [38], which is inhibited by PP2A in neurons [39]. Corroborating its relevance in protection against neurodegeneration, PP2A appears depressed, inhibited or inactivated in AD patients’ brains [40] and inhibition of its function in animal models results in neurodegenerative phenotypes [40]. For all of these reasons, pharmacological activation or re-activation of PP2A has become a valuable strategy for drug development in AD [41]. In the last decade, various approaches have been undertaken to reach these goals [17]. The majority of examples have been addressed to indirectly (re)activate PP2A, by inhibiting its cellular inhibitors, including I2/SET [42], CIP2A [43] and PME-1 [44] (Fig. 1). More recent contributions have focused on directly potentiating PP2A activity [45], highlighting phenothiazine derivatives and tricyclic sulfonamides, discovered from chemical library screenings [46], as small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs) [47] (Fig. 1). In addition, complex natural products have also been suggested to activate PP2A, such as polyphyllin I [43] (Fig. 1), cornel iridoid glycosides [48], Gingko Biloba extract [49] or pseudoginsenoside-F11 [50]. Overall, the direct PP2A-activating drug (PAD) that has reached the highest level of clinical trial up to date has been sodium selenate, known as VEL-015 [51]. For more than a decade, our research group has been interested in developing new direct PADs through rational drug design-based methodologies, backed up by computational docking [52]. Like that, we reported a 1,8-naphthyridine derivative (Fig. 2) [53] and a family of 3-aminomethylindoles [54] and azaindoles [55], showing both PP2A recovery capabilities and interesting neuroprotective profiles in several in vitro and in vivo models of AD. To obtain more potent and selective PADs, we recently focused on the chemical structure of okadaic acid (OA), the best-known PP2A selective inhibitor [56] (Fig. 2). This toxin has been the object of deep structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies [57], showing that the central cyclic fragment (C19 – C27) and the one at the spiroketal edge (C30 – C38) (Fig. 2) do not participate in the inhibitory effect of OA, as they interact with amino acids far from the PP2A-C catalytic triad. Instead, they increase the affinity of OA for the PP2A-C subunit [58, 59]. Hence, we hypothesized that small molecules mimicking these two cyclic fragments might still bind, but no longer inhibit PP2A-C. In addition, this particular interaction might also prevent PP2A inhibitors, either endogenous ones or toxins, could get close to PP2A; or that toxin- or cellular inhibitor-inhibited PP2A enzymatic activity could be restored. This hypothesis was recently underscored by the chemotherapeutic potential of a C-glycoside small analogue to OA C19–C27 fragment, named ITH12680 (1) (Fig. 2), which resensitized non-small cells lung cancer cells to cisplatin treatment in a model of chemoresistance, via a mechanism that restored PP2A activity [60]. In the current study, we report improved C-glycoside analogues of the OA C19–C27 fragment, and their neuroprotective potential in neurodegeneration models related to pathologic tau hyperphosphorylation.",910,14.pdf
41,C-glycosides analogues of the okadaic acid central fragment exert neuroprotection via restoration of PP2A-phosphatase activity: A rational design of potential drugs for Alzheimer's disease targeting tauopathies,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2023.115245,result,"The design of C-glycosides with potential PAD ability was based on the OA central fragment C19–C27, maintaining the absolute configuration of analogous stereocenters (Fig. 2). In some examples, we pursued increasing structural rigidity by tightening the exocyclic oxygen atoms through cyclic acetals. The drugability of designed compounds was maintained according to physicochemical properties related to Lipinski’s rule of five (Table S1, supplementary material). To furnish the desired entities, we have taken advantage of the Organic Chemistry literature centered on pursuing the total synthesis of OA [61–63] and other dinophysistoxins [64], where the contributions of Forsyth’s group have been crucial. Compound 1, prepared following the Hosomi-Sakurai reaction [60], was subjected to basic hydrolysis with sodium methoxide to afford diol 2 in quantitative yield (Scheme 1). Classical methods recruiting milder hydrolyses such as the use of TEA [61] were less efficient. As discussed above, rigidity was achieved by the generation of cyclic acetals, which also dissipated the high hydrophilicity of 2 (c log P = 0.3). First, the reaction of 2 with benzaldehyde dimethylacetal according to Isobe’s conditions yielded compound 3 in medium yields (Scheme 1). Despite the fact that acetal 3 showed sensibility to aqueous acid media, the use of neutralized solvents sorted out its potential instability. The acetal 4, which presents an acetonide structure, was obtained from reaction of 2 with 2-methoxypropene under mild acid catalysis in quantitative yield (Scheme 1), which exhibited increased stability. Then, with the purpose of resembling the oxygen at C19 of OA (Fig. 2), compounds 3 and 4 were hydroxylated under hydroboration/oxidation conditions. Unlike what was reported in the literature, treatment with diborane was unsuccessful in any of the experimental conditions tested. Better outcomes were achieved with 9-BBN, as its reaction with the benzylidene derivative 3 provided alcohol 5 (Scheme 2), although chromatographic purification was rather complicated. Only the use of a preparative TLC allowed to isolate alcohol 5 in low yields. The more stable acetonide 4 yielded alcohol 6 in good yields (82%, Scheme 2) after regular automatized chromatography. Noteworthy, beyond the left side of the OA C19–C27 fragment, the own C19 shows a diol substructure. Hence, we wondered whether a non-classical isosteres strategy to build a 1,2-diol moiety could furnish bioactive compounds. For that purpose, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation [65] allowed us to obtain derivatives possessing vicinal diols with high stereoselectivity from alkenes 3 and 4. The reaction of alkenes 3 (R1 = Ph, R2 = H) and 4 (R1, R2 = Me) with AD-mix-β resulted in the formation of 1,2-diols 7 and 8, respectively, possessing R configuration at C2 with high stereoselectivity and very good yields. Under similar experimental conditions, the commercial reagent AD-mix-α afforded the (2S)-alkenes 9 and 10 with good yields and very good stereoselectivity. AD-mix reagents α and β oppositely exert syn-dihydroxylations asymmetrically ruled by the cis-trans isomerism of the olefinic substrate. However, the stereoselective discrimination between both pro-chiral faces is not so obvious in monosubstituted alkenes such as 3 and 4. For this reason, we have confirmed the stereoselectivity of AD-mix reagents by X-Ray diffraction (Fig. S1, supplementary material) using compound 10 as a model. During the pharmacological evaluation of target compounds and subsequent computational docking studies, we considered of interest the benzoylation of mono-alcohols 5 and 6. Treatment with BzCl in pyridine generated benzoates 11 and 12 with very low yields (Scheme 3). Trends with stronger bases were unsuccessful. For instance, the use of K2CO3 as a base led to the diacetal 6 deprotection along benzoylation, yielding compound 13 (Table 1). Analogues to OA central fragment 1–13 mitigated OA and cytostatin-induced protein phosphatases inhibition in SH-SY5Y cells. The SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line is a well-described model to estimate the effect of potential PADs, as it draws a readable phosphatase activity that is sensitive to the presence of PP2A selective inhibitors: exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to the selective inhibitor OA at 15 nM for 18 h indeed diminished the para-nitrophenyl phosphate (p NPP)-measured phosphatase activity by 29% (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, most of the C-glycosides tested, administered at a concentration of 1 μM to SH-SY5Y cells, counteracted the OA-induced drop of phosphatase activity by 50% or more (Fig. 3 and Table S1, supplementary material). In general, rigidified compounds with benzylidene moiety outperformed their acetonide analogues, except for compound 10, which was the best PAD, together with benzylidene derivative 7. Only diol 13, which bears a long benzoyl group, was unable to antagonize OA inhibitory actions. Similarly, the incorporation of a benzoyl in 11 and 12 was unfruitful for PP2A recovery activity, compared with the corresponding free alcohol analogues 5 and 6. The AD drug memantine was used as standard in these experiments, considering its pro-activating profile of PP2A [66] independent of the blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate-sensitive glutamate receptors (NMDAr). Although the cellular manifestations caused by nanomolar concentrations of OA are generally ascribed to its inhibitory effect on PP2A [67], a possibility exists that it could affect other PPP with a less physiological role in the central nervous system, such as PP1, PP4 or PP5 [56, 68]. To corroborate that activity of compounds 1–13 was directly related to a PP2A restoring profile, we repeated p NPP-based experiments using the toxin cytostatin, which is a less potent but much more selective PP2A inhibitor [68]. SH-SY5Y cells treated with cytostatin at 2 μM diminished their p-NPP-probed phosphatase activity by 28% (Fig. 4). In a quite similar fashion to that observed in the previous experiment with OA, most of the assayed C-glycosides dissipated the inhibitory effects of cytostatin on SH-SY5Y cells by around 50%. The best antagonist compound against cytostatin was diol 2. Again, the incorporation of benzoyl was detrimental for PAD activity. In some cases, acetonides worsened recovery of phosphatase activity compared with benzylidene analogues, but this was not so obvious in diols 7–10. Indeed, these C-glycosides presenting a 1,2-diol group from Sharpless’ dihydroxylation presented a very robust PAD capacity (Figs. 3 and 4). Analogues to OA central fragment 1–13 protected in vitro neuronal models against several toxic stimuli related to neurodegeneration. Prior to assessing the neuroprotective effects of the compounds 1–13 at in vitro models of neurodegeneration, we confirmed that C-glycosides per se lacked toxicity in a wide range of concentrations, measured with the method of MTT reduction (Fig. S2, supplementary material). A tiny reduction of cell viability is only observed upon the use of compound 2 at a concentration of 30 μM (Fig. S2, supplementary material). Next, we evaluated whether the PAD activity of compounds 1–13 exerted neuroprotection in neuronal in vitro models damaged with several toxic stimuli related to neurodegeneration. Because of its high inhibitory capacity of PPP, mainly of PP2A, OA has been widely used to resemble AD manifestations in particular, but tauopathies in general, in both in vitro and in vivo models [54–56, 67]. For instance, it has been described that SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cultures show a loss of cell viability when challenged with OA at nanomolar concentrations during several hours of incubation [69]. A 20 h-exposition of SH-SY5Y cells to OA 20 nM indeed provoked a loss of about 30% in cell viability, measured by the MTT colorimetric dye, of about 30%. In this situation, compounds 1–13, pre-incubated (24 h) and co-incubated at 1 μM with OA 20 nM, protected SH-SY5Y cells from OA-induced cell death in a statistically significant fashion, except 7, 8 and 13 (Table 1). Stereochemistry at C2 dramatically influenced neuroprotection vs OA. The reference drug memantine was used as standard in the PP2A inhibition-derived neuroprotection experiments [66]. On the other hand, cytostatin has not been object of extensive research as an inducer model of neuronal death. Nevertheless, we found that it was a very reliable and straightforward tool to support and reinforce that the neuroprotective properties of the target compounds 1–13 are directly related to PP2A restoring activity. Thus, cytostatin, added to SH-SY5Y cells at 2.5 μM for 20 h, provoked a 35% drop of cell viability, monitored by the MTT assay. Again, most C-glycosides tested mitigated the neuronal damage induced by cytostatin (Table 1), as only compounds 7 and 13 failed, while the 1,2-diol acetonide derivative 10 provided the best neuroprotection. One of the most relevant features of PP2A is the control of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, as it down-regulates several neurodegeneration-leading inflammatory mediators, by dephosphorylation [34, 37]. For this reason, we found of interest to test the neuroprotective profile of compounds 1–13 in an in vitro model of oxidative stress, induced by 30 μM rotenone/10 μM oligomycin A (R/O). Rotenone and oligomycin A inhibit complexes I and V of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, respectively, triggering reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ATP synthesis lockout [70]. Application of the R/O cocktail to SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h resulted in a cell viability decay of 40%. The pre- and co-incubation with the C-glycosides at 1 μM protected the neuroblastoma cultures against cell damage by R/O in 8 out of the 13 compounds probed, with the largest effect seen for alkene 4 (Table 1). Although they have not been designed as antioxidants, the fact that this family of PADs exhibited a neuroprotective profile against oxidative stress underlines the important role of PP2A in the regulation of the cellular redox state. In this respect, the incorporation of a benzoyl moiety in compounds 11–13 impaired the antioxidant properties of this series, while the presence of a pending vinyl group promoted this, presumably because of the scavenging character of accessible double bonds. The last cell model we used to test our compounds was based on the excitotoxicity suffered by neuronal cultures exposed to high and sustained concentrations of glutamate, i.e. 50 μM, which can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative disorders [66], leading to overstimulation of NMDAr and neuronal cell death [71]. The value of this experimental model lies in the fact that PP2A regulates NMDAr signaling [72], for instance, by dephosphorylation of its NR1 subunit, thereby desensitizing it. So, a potential PP2A activator should hinder the neurotoxic events derived from glutamate exposure. Since SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells lack functional NMDAr [73], we used embryonic rat cortical neurons to evaluate potential neuroprotective effects exerted by C-glycosides 1–13 against glutamate excitotoxicity. First, the compounds were incubated with cortical neurons in the absence of glutamate to monitor any per se toxicity in this model (Fig. S3, supplementary material). Only 11 and 8, with no-significance in this case, slightly diminished neuronal viability at 30 μM. Next, we repeated these experiments in the presence of glutamate. While glutamate decreased cell viability by 48%, two thirds of the compounds protected cortical neurons against this toxic stimulus in a statistically significant fashion (Table 1). Again, the family of 1,2-diols 7–10 showed the best protective effect, as they increased glutamate-challenged cortical neuron viability by about 20%, similarly to the NMDAr antagonist memantine. In conclusion, most of the C-glycosides analogues to the OA central fragment studied herein, showed a wide-spectrum neuroprotective profile and a good ability to restore or increase PP2A enzymatic activity. Among all derivatives examined, the C-glycosides 1, 3, 9 and 10 outstood, for (1) developing neuroprotection in all the models tested, for (2) preventing the OA or cytostatin-induced PP2A inhibition, and for (3) lacking toxicity per se in a wide range of concentrations. Of these four compounds, compound 10 was further selected for additional follow-up studies that aimed to deepen its pharmacological and safety profile and its mechanism of action, since it resulted in the highest restoration of OA-inhibited PP2A activity (Fig. 3), and the best protective effect against cytostatin-induced neurotoxicity (Table 1). Rigid analog to OA central fragment 10 reduced the OA-induced inhibition of PP2A-B55α and PP2A-B56α isolated from transfected HEK-293T cells. We further confirmed the PP2A-recovering capability of compound 10 by carrying out in vitro phosphatase activity measurements on purified PP2A complexes using a canonical phospho-peptide substrate (K-R-pT-I-R-R) through the Malachite Green method (Fig. 5). Two different PP2A trimeric complexes were analyzed, one harboring the B55α (or Bα) isoform, which is the chief regulatory enzyme of tau dephosphorylation [74], and one encompassing the B56α (or B’α) subunit, which down-regulates major tau kinases, such as ERK1/2 [75]. Both PP2A trimers were isolated by GFP-trapping from HEK-293T cells transfected with GFP-tagged B-type subunits, as described [60]. Since these trimers manifested a slightly different sensitivity to OA, the transfected cells were subjected to a slightly different concentration of the toxin, which resulted in both cases in a detectable and significant reduction of phosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 5, PP2A-B55α and PP2A-B56α showed a time-dependent inhibition of about 20–30% when isolated from cells challenged with 15 and 20 nM OA, respectively. Noticeably, the rigid C-glycoside 10, administered at 1 μM, partially recovered OA-inhibited PP2A enzymatic activities (Fig. 5), with a higher efficiency towards PP2A-B55α than over PP2A-B56α. Compound 10 prevented the OA-induced increase of tau and GSK-3β phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. We next wondered whether the rigid glycoside 10 would also be able to modulate the phosphorylation levels of two phosphoprotein substrates of PP2A in SH-SY5Y cells: tau and GSK-3β. Western-blot experiments corroborated increased tau phosphorylation at amino acids Ser202 and Thr205 upon 20 h of OA treatment (Fig. 6A). Increased phosphorylation at these sites is commonly found in NFT [28]. The presence of the C-glycoside 10 prevented OA-induced tau hyperphosphorylation by half (Fig. 6A). Since it is well-known that PP2A dephosphorylates these pro-aggregating amino acids in tau [76], we might speculate that the administration of PADs like C-glycoside 10, by up-regulating PP2A, might prevent NFT formation, thereby counteracting tauopathy progression. In addition, PP2A regulates the enzymatic activity of several tau kinases. We found that C-glycoside 10 may also intervene with this regulation mechanism, since it also inhibited OA-induced GSK-3β hyperphosphorylation at Ser9 (Fig. 6B). Computational docking of 10 on PP2A catalytic subunit. Backed by the promising PAD profile of 10, and with the aim of figuring the structural clues of its interaction to PP2A, we ran docking studies on the catalytic subunit PP2A-C. PP2A crystal structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org, 2IE4) [57]. Under its lowest energy conformation, compound 10 is posed at a binding pocket formed by amino acids Gln122, Ile123, Val189, Pro190 and His191 (Fig. 7A). The OA fragments C19–C27 and C30–C38 also present high affinity for these amino acids [57]. Electrostatic view (Fig. 7B) shows that alcohols at C1 and C2 of 10 are accommodated at a positive-charged area, whilst methyl groups are projected to a neutral area formed by Ile123, Gln122 and Val126. Fig. 7C illustrates possible interactions of 10 with this binding pocket. Methyl groups face to a neutral area, generating hydrophobic interactions with Ile123 and the hydrocarbon skeleton of Gln122. Several H-bonds (Fig. 7C, dashed green lines) can be detected, where the strongest is that between C1(S)–OH as a donor and the carbonyl of Pro190 (1.91 Å). This OH also H-bonds as a donor with the Cys196 sulfur (2.86 Å) and, as an acceptor, with the Trp200 indole NH (2.80 Å). These interactions could explain the good results of the dihydroxylated derivatives 7–10, but also the slightly better behavior of 10 compared with 8. In addition, the electronically dense glycosidic oxygen H-bonds the positively charged His191 (3.12 Å). A weak but intramolecular (therefore favored) H-bond appears between C1–OH and one of the dioxin oxygen atoms (3.81 Å). This intramolecular interaction could be the driving force for the shape of the hydrocarbon chain of 10, placed behind the C-glycoside cycle, influencing pharmacological properties. To probe this hypothesis, compounds 11–13 were synthesized. Since they proved to be the worst PAD of the family, such hypothesis would prevail. Compound 10 shows a high probability of CNS penetration. Based on its pharmacological properties, compound 10 seems an appropriate drug for further in vivo studies and preclinical assays. However, even the most suitable pharmacodynamic properties of a drug are worthless unless it can reach its site of action. Since the entire family of designed compounds, including 10, fulfill the Lipinski’s rule of five, we expect them to show an appropriate bioavailability. However, as these compounds need to be able to exert their pharmacological activity within the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, to cross the highly lipophilic blood-brain barrier (BBB), we carried out parallel artificial membrane permeation assays (PAMPA) [77] in the presence of a lipid extract of porcine brains (Fig. 8). The results show that compound 10 proves a high probability of brain penetration, similar to that offered by the positive control testosterone (T) (Fig. 8). In silico testing of compound 10 safety profile. As compound 10 demonstrated the best pharmacological profile, we decide to assess its toxicity profile and metabolism in silico with Toxtree software v. 3.1.0 [78]. Compound 10 showed an acceptable safety profile (Table S2, supplementary material), no structural alerts were found for in vitro mutagenicity, genotoxic or non-genotoxic carcinogenicity, and no DNA binding alerts were detected. Further in vivo testing is needed to assess the heterocyclic rings and the hydrogen bond-accepting structure safety, which cannot permit a strong initial presumption of safety. We additionally used the Toxtree Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism module to predict the more plausible metabolites of compound 10 (Table S3, supplementary material). The four predicted metabolites displayed similar safety results to the parent compound (Table S4-to S6, supplementary material). Therefore, the obtained results made the molecule suitable to continue with the in vivo tests. Compound 10 rescued the memory deficit of mice subjected to LPS in the object recognition test. Backed by the BBB permeability data, we next performed the first in vivo studies with the lead compound 10. To this end, we assessed whether this compound could abrogate the cognitive impairment in a classical in vivo model of neurodegeneration, i.e. the object recognition test in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Fig. 9). In this test, the short-term memory of mice is measured, by comparing the exploration time between an object previously shown in a training phase (see experimental part), and another one introduced in the test phase. Mice with normal short-term memory are expected to explore the novel object for a longer time compared with animals subjected to a neurotoxicant such as LPS that induced neurodegeneration and memory loss [79]. The neurodegenerative effects of LPS have been comprehensively reviewed [80], and include the development of tauopathy and reduced short-term memory [81]. As expected, i.p. injection of LPS 1 mg/mL provoked mice to lose interest for the novel object, as no significant difference was observed between the exploration time of the old versus the new object in the test phase (Fig. 9), inferring that their memory was compromised. However, co-injection of compound 10 at a 10 mg/mL i.p. dose, impeded such loss of memory, as LPS-subjected mice treated with compound 10 now invested significantly more time (2.4-fold) exploring the new object versus the old one (Fig. 9).",3123,14.pdf

Neuropathological hallmarks of AD include neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, senile plaques derived from the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, brain atrophy induced by neuronal loss, and synaptic dysfunctions. Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system. Dysregulation of DAPK1 has been shown to contribute to various neurological diseases including AD, ischemic stroke and Parkinson’s disease (PD). We have established an upstream effect of DAPK1 on Aβ and tau pathologies and neuronal apoptosis through kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation, supporting a causal role of DAPK1 in the pathophysiology of AD. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about how DAPK1 is involved in various AD pathological changes including tau hyperphosphorylation, Aβ deposition, neuronal cell death and synaptic degeneration. The underlying molecular mechanisms of DAPK1 dysregulation in AD are discussed. We also review the recent progress regarding the development of novel DAPK1 modulators and their potential applications in AD intervention. These findings substantiate DAPK1 as a novel therapeutic target for the development of multifunctional disease-modifying treatments for AD and other neurological disorders.",198,15.pdf
43,Death-associated protein kinase 1 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40035-023-00395-5,introduction,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disorder. According to the newest statistics, more than 55 million people worldwide are suffering from AD or related dementia, making AD and other dementias the leading cause of disabilities in the elderly [1]. As of 2019, the estimated healthcare cost among people with dementia was more than $590 billion, and this cost is projected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2050 [2]. AD is characterized pathologically by the formation of numerous intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of highly phosphorylated tau proteins and extracellular senile plaques composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. In addition to NFTs and amyloid plaques, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction are commonly observed during disease progression, and contribute to cell death, breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and impairment of neural circuits in the brain. In particular, neuronal loss is a prominent pathological feature in AD, and has been associated with both structural and functional changes in brain regions involved in learning and memory [3]. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a pivotal role in regulating the microtubule dynamics. The interaction between tau and microtubules is affected by the phosphorylation status of tau in neurons, which is controlled by a host of kinases and phosphatases [4, 5]. The pathological phosphorylation of tau in AD not only drives the dissociation of tau from microtubules, but also affects the localization and solubility of tau in neurons [6–8], thus leading to microtubule disruption and the formation of filamentous paired helical filaments in the AD brain [9–11]. The spatiotemporal accumulation of NFTs in the brain is significantly correlated with disease progression and the degree of cognitive impairment in AD patients [12–14], suggesting a central role of tau hyperphosphorylation in neurodegeneration. The aggregation of Aβ, a product from amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis, forms soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils in the brain. The accumulation of Aβ species in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain parenchyma is an early pathological feature of AD and has long been considered as an upstream trigger of various pathological changes in disease progression [15]. There are two distinct proteolytic pathways of APP, the non-amyloidogenic processing which involves sequential cleavage of APP by α- and γ-secretases, and the amyloidogenic processing which is mediated by β- and γ-secretases [16–20]. The main products of the amyloidogenic pathway are Aβ40 and Aβ42 [21–23]. The generation of Aβ is regulated by both the function of secretases and the expression of APP [24, 25]. For example, pathogenic mutations in APP and presenilin-1 (PS1) in familial AD strongly promote Aβ production and increase the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio [26–30]. Besides, post-translational modifications of APP such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and sumoylation also have a direct impact on Aβ generation [31–33]. DAPK1, a serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase, was initially identified from an antisense cDNA expression library of HeLa cells as a potential mediator of interferon-γ-induced cell death [34]. In subsequent studies, DAPK1 was shown to play a critical role in stimulus-triggered apoptosis, autophagy, and anoikis-like cell death. The pro-apoptotic function of DAPK1 is closely associated with the pathogenesis of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [35]. In particular, genetic variations in DAPK1 have been shown to be associated with late-onset AD (LOAD) in different populations [36–38]. Furthermore, the high abundance of DAPK1 in the cortex and hippocampus also highlights a central role of DAPK1 in regulating neuronal functions [39]. In this review, we discuss the role of DAPK1 and its implications in the pathophysiology of brain diseases, with a particular focus on AD. We also discuss strategies and translational potential for attenuating AD-related neuropathologies through pharmacological or genetic targeting of DAPK1.",600,15.pdf
44,Death-associated protein kinase 1 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40035-023-00395-5,result,"The DAPK family consists of five kinase members: DAPK1, DAPK1-related protein 1 (DRP-1 or DAPK2), zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK or DAPK3), DAPK1-related apoptosis-inducing protein kinase 1 (DRAK1), and DRAK2 (Fig. 1a). Among these family members, DAPK2 and DAPK3 are highly homologous to DAPK1 in the catalytic domains, showing 80% and 83% identity at the amino acid level, respectively [40]. However, the kinase domains of human DRAK1 and DRAK2 share only 48% and 51% sequence homology with the catalytic domain of DAPK1 [41]. The extra-catalytic domains of DAPK family members vary greatly in size and structure, indicating distinct regulatory mechanisms, subcellular localizations and biological functions of these kinases. For instance, DAPK1 and DAPK2 are mainly found in the cytoplasm, and DAPK3 can be detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [42], while both DRAK1 and DRAK2 are exclusively localized to the cell nucleus [43]. In addition to the subcellular distribution, the DAPK family members also show different tissue expression profiles in the human body. For example, the expression of DAPK1 and DAPK3 has low tissue specificity, while DAPK2 is abundantly expressed in the bone marrow [44]. DAPK1 is a multidomain protein with distinct functional motifs involved in the modulation of catalytic activity, substrate binding, protein stability and localization of DAPK1. As shown in Fig. 1a, DAPK1 is composed of a kinase domain (13–267 aa), a Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-binding domain (275–334 aa), an ankyrin repeats domain (378–638 aa), two putative P-loops, a Ras of complex (ROC) domain (667–995 aa), a C-terminal of ROC (COR) domain (995–1288 aa), a death domain (DD, 1300–1398 aa) and a C-terminal serine-rich tail [35]. To date, there is no 3D structure of full-length DAPK1 available in the protein data bank, while the structure of the kinase domain of DAPK1 is well-resolved. The catalytic domain of DAPK1 is composed of 11 subdomains, including a β-sheet-rich N-lobe and an α-helix-rich C-lobe connected by a short hinge region (Fig. 1b). The conserved lysine (K42) in this domain is vital for the kinase activity as it is inside the ATP-binding loop. The catalytic activity of DAPK1 is abolished by substituting the lysine residue with an alanine residue (K42A) [45]. The basic loop region (45–56 aa) containing mostly positively charged residues in the kinase domain is a characteristic motif of the DAPK family as it is responsible for the homo- and hetero-dimerization of DAPK, which is critical for the modulation of kinase activity [46]. In addition to a direct regulation of catalytic activity, the kinase domain also affects the protein stability of DAPK1 by interacting with the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) through the amino terminal lobe (αC-β4 loop) [47, 48]. It has been suggested that the enriched neutral and positively charged residues in this subdomain are responsible for the interaction between DAPK1 and HSP90 [48], which further contributes to the maturation and stabilization of cellular DAPK1. The catalytic activity of DAPK1 is also regulated by the Ca2+/CaM–autoregulatory domain, which serves as a pseudo-substrate and occupies the catalytic cleft in the absence of CaM, thereby preventing the activation of DAPK1. In addition, the enzymatic activity of DAPK1 is regulated through phosphorylation at several sites that are located within the Ca2+/CaM-autoregulatory domain. For example, the autophosphorylation of Ser308 of DAPK1 has an inhibitory effect on its kinase activity [49]. Full activation of DAPK1 requires both dephosphorylation of Ser308 and binding of the Ca2+-activated CaM to the autoregulatory domain [50]. The interaction with CaM can release the catalytic cleft of DAPK1, and the dephosphorylation of Ser308 increases the affinity for CaM, thereby promoting the catalytic activity of DAPK1 even at low CaM levels [50]. The ankyrin repeats domain, made up of eight linearly aligned motifs with 33 amino acid residues, is a protein–protein interaction domain facilitating communication with other proteins. This domain is involved in the interaction between DAPK1 and actin filaments, which is pivotal for the correct cellular localization of DAPK1 [51]. Additionally, several ubiquitin ligases such as DAPK-interacting protein 1 (DIP-1) and carboxyl terminal of HSP70-interacting protein have been reported to interact with DAPK1 via the ankyrin repeats domain, thus regulating the proteasomal degradation of DAPK1 in cells [52, 53]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the phosphorylation of Tyr491/492 residues in the fourth ankyrin repeat by Src kinase inhibits the catalytic activity of DAPK1 [54]. The ROC and COR domains of DAPK1 regulate the kinase activity of DAPK1 by functioning as a GTPase. DAPK1 binds to GTP via the P-loop motif in the ROC domain and hydrolyzes GTP, resulting in conformational changes in the kinase and a reduction in inhibitory Ser308 phosphorylation [55, 56]. Apart from the intrinsic GTPase activity, the ROC-COR domain is able to interact with the phospho-Ser/Thr-directed peptidyl prolyl isomerase 1 (Pin1) via the cytoskeleton-binding region, leading to suppression of the activity of Pin1 that is critical for regulating the function of various phosphoproteins by isomerizing the phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro motif [57, 58]. The death domain of DAPK1 also actively regulates the kinase activity and the degradation of DAPK1, and participates in protein–protein interactions important for cellular apoptosis and energy metabolism. For instance, the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) binds to the death domain and phosphorylates the Ser735 residue of DAPK1, which enhances the kinase activity of DAPK1 in vitro and in vivo [59]. DAPK1 is able to interact with Kelch-like family member 20 and tuberous sclerosis 2 protein via the death domain, resulting in the proteasome- and lysosome-mediated degradation of DAPK1, respectively [60, 61]. Interestingly, DAPK1 has been reported to interact with and activate the pyruvate kinase isoform M2 in cancer cells in a kinase activity-independent manner. This interaction alters cellular metabolism by increasing the glycolytic rate and the generation of lactate in cells [62]. The serine-rich tail in the C-terminus acts as a negative regulator of DAPK1 activity as the deletion of this domain augments the pro-apoptotic function of DAPK1 [63]. In addition to the K42A mutant which shows diminished kinase activity, several other DAPK1 mutants have also been developed for research purposes. The ΔCaM, a mutant lacking the Ca2+/CaM-binding domain, and the phosphoablative S308A mutant, in which serine 308 is replaced by an alanine residue, are examples of constitutively active forms of DAPK1 with elevated catalytic activity [64]. The ΔCyto, a mutant lacking the cytoskeleton-binding region, shows altered colocalization with actin filaments and thus affects the cellular function of DAPK1 [64]. Protein kinases play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases [65, 66]. The activities of a variety of neuronal enzymes, receptors, and ion channels are regulated by their phosphorylation status [67, 68]. The spatiotemporal expression of DAPK1 in the brain indicates an essential role of this kinase in the regulation of neuronal functions. Further genetic analyses and animal studies have established that DAPK1 is indeed involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we focus on the role of DAPK1 in AD based on the research from our group and others, in order to present a comprehensive picture of how DAPK1 contributes to the pathophysiology of AD as well as the therapeutics targeting DAPK1. Although DAPK1 is ubiquitously present in different tissues and cell types, it is most abundantly expressed in the brain and lung tissues according to a Northern blotting analysis in rats [39]. In particular, the spatiotemporal expression of DAPK1 in the brain appears to be associated with neurodevelopment and neurogenesis. The temporal analysis of DAPK1 mRNA expression in rat brains revealed that the expression of DAPK1 mRNA is detectable at embryonic day 13 (E13) and further increases to a peak at approximately E20. However, the DAPK1 mRNA level gradually declines after birth [39]. The spatial determination of DAPK1 expression by in situ hybridization shows that DAPK1 mRNA can be extensively found in both proliferative and postmitotic regions within the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum during embryonic development and the neonatal stage [39]. These regions undergo widespread programmed cell death in embryonic neurogenesis [69, 70]. At postnatal and adult stages, the cerebral cortex and cerebellum both manifest a significant decline in DAPK1 mRNA expression, while DAPK1 expression in the hippocampus is maintained at high levels particularly in CA1, CA2 and the dentate gyrus [39, 71]. Besides, neuronal cells have higher DAPK1 expression than glial cells in the brain under physiological conditions. Thus, the widespread expression of DAPK1 during brain development and confined expression in mature neuronal populations in adults suggest that DAPK1 may not only participate in developmental neuronal death, but also play a role in regulating neuronal activity and synaptic functions. Indeed, it has been reported that DAPK1 is substantially enriched in hippocampal synapses and has complex interactions with numerous synaptic proteins [72, 73], which underlies the pathological influence of DAPK1 dysregulation on brain functions in neurological disorders such as AD. As a stress-responsive protein kinase, the dysregulation of DAPK1 expression or its activity has been implicated in a variety of neurological disorders. In Table 1, we briefly summarize how DAPK1 is dysregulated in common neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke, PD, AD, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). For instance, cerebral ischemia not only leads to DAPK1 activation, but also induces aberrant interactions between DAPK1 and other proteins such as p53 and GluN2B, thereby leading to neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction [73, 74]. The activation of DAPK1 in ischemia is likely mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-induced Ca2+ influx and the subsequent dephosphorylation at Ser308 of DAPK1 by the calcineurin phosphatase [75]. Another common disease with Ca2+ signaling disorder is epilepsy. Interestingly, our research demonstrated that DAPK1 dysregulation in epilepsy is model-dependent, as convulsive dosing of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) immediately activates the DAPK1 function in the mouse brain without upregulating its expression, while chronic exposure to PTZ at a low dose in the kindling model increased both the protein level and the activity of DAPK1 in the mouse brain [76]. Further, our study showed that kainic acid (KA) promotes DAPK1 activity by upregulating the ERK-mediated Ser735 phosphorylation in a mouse epilepsy model [77]. The dysregulation of DAPK1 is also noted in neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as AD, PD and TBI. For example, our previous research reported that the DAPK1 protein level but not its mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of AD patients [78, 79]. Likewise, it has been shown that the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model displays a marked increase in DAPK1 protein level in the striatal neurons without showing alterations of mRNA expression. The specific DAPK1 alteration pattern in AD and PD might be caused by the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms such as microRNA (miRNA)-mediated translational control of the target protein. Several miRNAs targeting DAPK1 have been found to be dysregulated in AD or PD [80–82]. These findings highlight a detrimental role of DAPK1 dysregulation in the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The relationship between DAPK1 and AD will be elaborated in the following sections to clarify the genetic associations, functional changes and underlying mechanisms. Genetic variation is thought to play a major role in the etiology of LOAD, which accounts for about 95% of all AD cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with the risk and the age of onset of AD. A number of genetic loci contributing to the susceptibility to AD have been identified [83–87]. Among them, the ε4 allele of ApoE has been confirmed as the strongest genetic risk factor for AD in various populations [88, 89]. The risk of AD is increased by about 3 folds and 15 folds in individuals carrying one or two copies of ApoE4 gene, respectively. The presence of ApoE4 allele is also associated with a younger age of onset of AD symptoms [90]. Several genetic variants (e.g., the unc-13 homolog B gene) in chromosome 9 have been suggested to be connected with the risk of LOAD in whole-genome sequencing and parametric linkage analyses [91]. SNP analysis of DAPK1, which is also localized on chromosome 9, has identified two variants, rs4878104 and rs4877365, that are potentially connected with LOAD in several sample cohorts [36]. This discovery has sparked research on DAPK1 SNPs and AD susceptibility in different populations, yielding controversial results regarding whether DAPK1 SNPs are correlated with the risk of LOAD. Li . first reported that rs4878104 and rs4877365 of DAPK1 influence the transcription of DAPK1 in an allele-specific manner, although both SNPs are inside the DAPK1 introns [36]. In particular, rs4878104 is located within a previously identified LOAD linkage peak and is repeatedly validated for its association with LOAD in six independent sample sets [36]. This finding was further corroborated by a genetic study in the Northern Han Chinese population, which showed that the genotype and the frequency of the rs4878104 but not the rs4877365 variant are significantly different between LOAD patients and age-matched controls [38]. Conversely, Minster . revealed that none of the DAPK1 SNPs are associated with LOAD in their cohort [92]. Similar results were also reported by several GWAS analyses in French, Polish and Italian populations [37, 93, 94]. The inconsistent findings then led to systematic meta-analysis aiming at elucidating the association between DAPK1 variants and AD, which discovered that the rs4878104 variant is not significantly associated with AD risk in the pooled population. Nevertheless, the subgroup analysis demonstrated that the rs4878104 variant is linked with AD risk in both American and Chinese populations but not in the European population [95]. Genotyping of rs4878104 revealed a discrepancy in the association between allele frequency and AD risk between Chinese and Caucasian populations, showing that the minor T allele is protective in Caucasians while the minor C allele is beneficial in Chinese population [36, 38]. In addition to the GWAS analysis, several biomarker-based studies have been performed to explore the association between DAPK1 and AD pathologies. For instance, Kauwe . reported that the minor allele of rs4878104 is associated with increased total CSF Aβ level [96]. However, by comparing brain samples from AD patients and healthy controls, Hainsworth . revealed that the expression of DAPK1 in the frontal cortex is not significantly different between AD and control cases. Moreover, the abundance of DAPK1 in the brain is also not correlated with Aβ level [97]. Thus far, there is still a lack of consistent molecular evidence to affirm the genetic association between DAPK1 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to AD, likely due to the complex etiology of AD attributed to gene-environmental interactions [98]. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out large-scale genetic analysis under the latest Alzheimer’s diagnostic framework by applying genetic epidemiologic methods such as Mendelian randomization, to better clarify the exact association between DAPK1 and AD phenotypes. The genetic link between DAPK1 variants and AD has triggered further investigations on whether DAPK1 is dysregulated in the brains of AD patients or mouse models. In the adult brain, DAPK1 expression is relatively abundant in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex [39, 71], two brain regions that are significantly affected during AD progression. Hainsworth . first compared the protein level of DAPK1 in the frontal cerebral cortex between AD patients and age-matched controls. The overall abundance of DAPK1 evaluated by immunoblot and immunostaining analyses was not significantly different between AD and control samples, although the AD cases displayed a trend of increase in the immunoblot analysis [97]. To further determine whether hippocampal DAPK1 expression differs between AD and control brains, we analyzed hippocampal tissues from AD patients and age-matched controls, and discovered that the DAPK1 protein level was markedly increased by about 2.5 folds in the hippocampus of AD patients compared with that in normal subjects [78, 79]. However, there was no significant difference in DAPK1 mRNA expression between AD and control samples [79]. Notably, the upregulation of DAPK1 appears to correlate with tau hyperphosphorylation in our sample cohorts [79]. Since tau pathology occurs early in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus during AD progression and may lead to irreversible synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss [115], we hypothesize that the hippocampal DAPK1 dysregulation may also be an early pathological event in the disease course of AD. In line with this, a recent study discovered that the AD patients have significantly elevated plasma DAPK1 content compared with age-matched controls. In addition, this increase is negatively correlated with the cognitive ability [111]. Thus, the DAPK1 protein can be potentially developed as a clinical biomarker to monitor disease progression. In AD mouse models, whether DAPK1 expression or function is dysregulated remains controversial in literature. Hainsworth . determined DAPK1 expression in brains of aged Tg2576 transgenic mice overexpressing the APP Swedish mutant and found that the DAPK1 protein level was comparable between AD mice and wild-type (WT) controls [97]. However, the expression of DAPK1 was significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of PS1 V97L transgenic mice compared with control mice at 6 and 9 months of age, which correlated with the appearance of Aβ accumulation and cognitive impairment [111]. Similarly, Duan . reported an elevation of DAPK1 expression in the hippocampus and cortex of 10-month-old human tau transgenic (hTau) mouse model, which paralleled the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau at Ser262 [113]. Nevertheless, none of the studies evaluated whether the enzymatic activity of DAPK1 is dysregulated in the brains of AD mouse models. Besides, whether DAPK1 is dysregulated in other AD mouse models of Aβ (e.g., APP/PS1 or 5xFAD) or tau (e.g., PS19 or tau P301L) pathologies remains to be characterized. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the expression of DAPK1 is elevated in the cortex overlying the corpus callosum in a mouse model of vascular dementia, which then drives abnormal accumulation of misfolded tau proteins in neurons and endothelial cells [116]. Brain ageing is tightly associated with the accumulation of cellular senescence in response to various stress signals, which may lead to structural and functional impairments in the central nervous system [117]. Guo . reported that the activity of DAPK1 is gradually increased whilst the protein level remains constant during the aging process in mouse hippocampus [118]. The age-dependent DAPK1 activation contributes to cognitive dysfunction in aged mice [118]. These findings indeed suggest that DAPK1 dysregulation plays a role in various cognitive disorders. Nevertheless, systematic analysis of DAPK1 expression and activity in the brains of AD mouse models is required to fully dissect the spatiotemporal association between DAPK1 and AD neuropathologies. The protein level of DAPK1 is tightly controlled by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Some transcriptional factors such as p53 and the cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) have been shown to affect DAPK1 transcription; however, their involvement in AD remains uncharacterized. Current evidence shows that the DAPK1 level is post-transcriptionally regulated in AD. In the following, we thus mainly focus on the post-transcriptional modulation of DAPK1 expression in AD. Hyperactivation of p53 is an important molecular feature in several neurodegenerative diseases [119]. The p53 protein can bind to the first intron of DAPK1 and efficiently reinforce the expression of DAPK1 in the presence of pro-apoptotic stimuli [120]. p53 upregulation in AD is mainly found in glial cells rather than in neurons [121]. Nevertheless, intracellular Aβ species also directly activate p53 expression by binding to its promoter [122]. Therefore, intracellular Aβ accumulation might upregulate DAPK1 expression through p53-mediated pathways. CREB1 is a well-known transcription factor in neurons. CREB1 is enriched on the promoter of DAPK1 and directly suppresses its transcription in the hippocampus. Reduced neuronal CREB expression may result in elevated DAPK1 expression and subsequent cell death, as has been reported in a rat brain injury model induced by cardiac arrest [123]. The CREB signaling is impaired in the brains of AD patients, as manifested by a significant decline in both total and activated CREB levels in AD subjects compared with those in normal controls [124]. Thus, the CREB-mediated transcriptional control of DAPK1 might be an alternative pathway that modulates DAPK1 expression in AD. Contrary to these findings, our previous studies established that the upregulation of DAPK1 expression in AD is not caused by transcriptional changes [78, 79]. These results suggest that the expression of DAPK1 in AD is likely regulated through both transcriptional processes and post-transcriptional pathways that are similar to those of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and CDK5 [125, 126]. Circadian dysregulation is tightly associated with the progression of AD [127]. Melatonin is a master regulator of human circadian rhythm and confers numerous beneficial effects on neuronal function [128]. The brain level of melatonin is lower in AD patients than in normal controls [129]. Since melatonin is capable of preventing tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ accumulation in AD mouse models, its downregulation may increase the vulnerability to AD [130, 131]. We recently uncovered an inverse correlation between brain melatonin level and DAPK1 expression in AD patients [129]. Furthermore, melatonin directly binds to the ankyrin repeats of DAPK1, leading to the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of DAPK1 in cells (Fig. 2a) [129]. Our study also proved that the melatonin-induced DAPK1 downregulation does not rely on melatonin receptors or DAPK1 gene transcription [129]. Indeed, the post-translational regulation of DAPK1 level in the cell is primarily controlled by the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways [132]. Several binding partners of DAPK1, including HSP90 and DIP-1, have been shown to regulate the stability of DAPK1 protein [47]. Molecular chaperones are key components for the maintenance of proteostasis in the cell by monitoring the proper folding, maturation and degradation of proteins [133]. With accumulation of intracellular Aβ species, molecular chaperones such as HSP90 may function to antagonize the cellular stress caused by the excessive misfolded proteins [134]. We recently observed that the primary neurons incubated with Aβ aggregates have a higher DAPK1 protein level than those without Aβ treatment [135]. However, the DAPK1 mRNA level is not altered by Aβ, which is in line with our previous findings in brain samples from AD patients [79]. The increased DAPK1 protein level by Aβ treatment is attributed to the HSP90-mediated stabilization of DAPK1 protein in neurons, as inhibition of HSP90 abolishes the Aβ-induced DAPK1 elevation (Fig. 2b) [135]. In addition to the protein stability regulation, DAPK1 expression may also be affected by various miRNAs. Our group has identified two miRNAs, miR-143-3p and miR-191-5p, as important upstream regulators of DAPK1 expression in AD. Levels of both miRNAs are significantly reduced in brains of AD patients, and are negatively correlated with DAPK1 protein level [80, 81]. Moreover, miR-143-3p and miR-191-5p bind to the 3′ UTR of DAPK1 mRNA. Instead of inducing mRNA degradation, they block the translation of cellular DAPK1 (Fig. 2c) [80, 81]. Several other miRNAs have been reported to regulate DAPK1 expression in the brain. For instance, DAPK1 is a target gene of miR-130a-3p. The downregulation of miR-130a-3p induced by Aβ treatment promotes DAPK1 expression, resulting in accelerated neuronal cell death and cognitive impairment [136]. MiR-124 binds to the 3′ UTR of DAPK1 mRNA and affects the translation of DAPK1 in ischemic stroke models [137]. In PD, a loss of miR-26a leads to an elevation of DAPK1 protein level in dopaminergic neurons [82, 138]. Interestingly, it has been reported that the level of miR-26a is significantly decreased in AD patients and mouse models [139, 140], and is closely associated with the cognitive ability in AD patients [139]. Therefore, it is expected that miR-26a dysregulation may also contribute to the DAPK1 upregulation in AD. The abnormal phosphorylation and accumulation of tau in the brain is closely associated with the disease course of AD, and has been used as a clinical biomarker for disease diagnosis [141]. Tau has about 85 putative phosphorylation sites, and around 50 sites, mostly located in the basic C-terminal half of the protein, have been identified in brain tissue [141, 142]. Phosphorylation modulates the surface charge of tau and its conformation, thus altering the inter- and intra-molecular interactions important for the physiological functions of tau in neurons [143]. In pathological conditions known as tauopathies, neuronal tau proteins are hyperphosphorylated at multiple sites, leading to the detachment of tau from microtubules and subsequent misfolding and aggregation, which ultimately drives microtubule disassembly and the formation of pathogenic tau aggregates [7]. It has been noted that the aberrant tau phosphorylation in AD is not only characterized by a 3- to 4-fold increase in overall phosphorylation level, but also by the presence of various novel modified sites not seen in healthy brains [144]. DAPK1 has been found to be upregulated in brains of hTau transgenic mouse models. By overexpressing or knocking down DAPK1 in HEK 293 cells stably expressing tau proteins, Duan . found that DAPK1 increases tau phosphorylation at Thr231, Ser262 and Ser396 sites [113]. Interestingly, DAPK1 has no effect on common tau phosphorylating kinases such as GSK-3β, CDK5, CaMKII and Cdc2 or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). However, DAPK1 overexpression elevates the activity of microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) through direct binding between the death domain of DAPK1 and the spacer region of MARK2 [113, 145]. MARK2 is known to interact with and phosphorylate tau at Ser262 residue [146]. MARK2 knockdown has no impact on DAPK1-induced tau hyperphosphorylation [113], but the MARK2-induced tau phosphorylation and microtubule destabilization are potentiated by DAPK1 in neurons as DAPK1 overexpression enhances MARK2 activity in tauopathy [145]. Interestingly, DAPK1 is able to interact with the tau protein through its kinase domain, further leading to tau phosphorylation at Ser262 [100], promoting dendritic spine damage and neuronal death in ischemic stroke mice [100]. Our group further identified a novel mechanism by which DAPK1 increases neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation in AD. We discovered that DAPK1 aggravates neuronal tau phosphorylation at Thr231, Ser262 and Ser396 by inhibiting the Pin1-mediated cis–trans isomerization of the pThr231-Pro motif, which is required to maintain normal tau functions and turnover (Fig. 3) [79, 147, 148]. This unique mechanism was further validated by the observation that DAPK1 enhances the protein stability of S262A (Ser to Ala) tau mutant, while having no effect on the T231A (Thr to Ala) mutant [79]. The DAPK1-induced tau hyperphosphorylation promotes the formation of sarkosyl-insoluble tau species (mature pathogenic NFTs), disintegrates microtubule structures and prevents neurite outgrowth [79]. Besides, the accumulation of cis-pThr231-tau caused by DAPK1 upregulation robustly triggers axonal damage and neuroinflammation in TBI mouse model [104]. Our recent study also demonstrated that toxic Aβ species facilitate tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation in neurons by upregulating DAPK1 expression [135]. Inhibition of DAPK1 activity with synthetic small molecules antagonizes pathological tau phosphorylation and accumulation caused by TBI or Aβ species [104, 135]. As a pro-apoptotic kinase, the upregulation of DAPK1 is believed to stimulate cell apoptosis under stress stimuli. However, it has been shown that tau hyperphosphorylation following DAPK1 activation exerts anti-apoptotic effects in N2a cells by blocking the generation of cleaved caspase-3 [113]. Previous research has reported that tau accumulation and hyperphosphorylation protect cells from apoptosis via reducing the p53 level and preserving mitochondrial functions [149]. DAPK1 can bind to p53 via the death domain and phosphorylate the Ser23 residue of p53, further triggering the p53-dependent transcription of apoptotic genes and mitochondrial damage in ischemic stroke [101, 150]. The Aβ species-induced DAPK1 upregulation in primary neurons leads to both tau hyperphosphorylation and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis [135]. Thus, it remains debatable as to whether DAPK1-induced tau phosphorylation confers anti-apoptotic effects in neurons. In addition to AD and TBI, it has been reported that chronic stress exposure in mice concomitantly elevates the expression of DAPK1 and abnormal tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus, which can be reversed by exercise training and antidepressant treatment [110]. These results together suggest that DAPK1 dysregulation indeed causes tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation, and promotes neuronal damage by disrupting the microtubule dynamics in AD and other neurological disorders. The accumulation and aggregation of Aβ in the brain parenchyma is an early pathological change in AD, occurring decades prior to the development of clinical symptoms [151]. The generation of Aβ by the amyloidogenic processing of APP is affected by the post-translational modification of APP in neurons [152]. Notably, the phosphorylation of APP in the intracellular domain modulates multiple steps of the proteolytic cleavage process and has a profound influence on the production of Aβ [33]. Eight phosphorylation sites have been identified in the cytoplasmic domain of APP thus far, and seven of them have been discovered in the brains of AD patients [33]. The Thr668 residue of APP (APP695 numbering) can be phosphorylated by a variety of kinases related to cell proliferation and stress responses [153]. Moreover, Thr668 phosphorylation has been proven to be highly upregulated in the brains of AD patients compared with age-matched controls. The phosphorylation of Thr668 facilitates the translocation of APP to endosomes, thus promoting the colocalization of APP with the β-secretase BACE1 [32]. As a consequence, the generation of Aβ is dramatically increased in neurons due to the enhanced amyloidogenic processing. Recently, we showed that DAPK1 interacts with APP through its death domain and increases the JNK3-mediated APP phosphorylation at Thr668, thereby shifting APP processing toward the amyloidogenic pathway (Fig. 4) [78]. DAPK1 strongly promotes the secretion of both Aβ40 and Aβ42, and ablation of DAPK1 significantly diminishes the production of Aβ in Tg2576 mouse model [78]. Besides, we observed a positive correlation between DAPK1 protein levels and APP phosphorylation at Thr668 in Alzheimer’s patient brains, further supporting the role of DAPK1 in regulating the amyloid pathology in AD [78]. We additionally revealed that pharmacological inhibition of DAPK1 activity by a selective DAPK1 inhibitor ((4Z)-4-(3-pyridylmethylene)-2-styryl-oxazol-5-one) significantly downregulates the amyloidogenic processing of APP and Aβ generation in different cell models, suggesting that DAPK1 is a promising target for early intervention of Aβ pathology in AD. Similar to the pThr231-Pro motif of tau, the pThr668-Pro motif of APP is also a substrate of Pin1-mediated cis–trans isomerization. The phosphorylation of Thr668 is essential for the binding between Pin1 and APP at the plasma membrane [154]. Pastorino . found that Pin1 potently catalyzes the conversion of the cis pThr668-Pro APP conformers to the trans conformation which is preferentially favored by the non-amyloidogenic processing in neurons [154]. Since DAPK1 is known to phosphorylate Ser71 of Pin1 and inhibits the prolyl isomerase activity [57], we speculate that the DAPK1-induced APP phosphorylation and the cis pThr668-Pro APP accumulation caused by DAPK1-induced Pin1 suppression both contribute to the excessive generation of Aβ in AD. In addition to affecting APP processing and Aβ generation, DAPK1 dysregulation is also involved in mediating Aβ neurotoxicity in the brain. The self-assembly of Aβ into soluble oligomers has been recognized as a main culprit for Aβ-related neuropathological changes [155]. Low-molecular-weight Aβ species activate DAPK1 by inducing the dephosphorylation of Ser308 and trigger caspase-3-dependent neuronal cell death [156]. We recently demonstrated that both low- and high-molecular-weight Aβ species upregulate DAPK1 protein levels in neurons and cause extensive neuronal apoptosis [135]. Additionally, the upregulation of DAPK1 by Aβ oligomers leads to Ca2+ overload and excitotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cell line via phosphorylation of the Ser1303 residue of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit, resembling the effect observed in an ischemic stroke mouse model [73, 111]. Neuroinflammation is another prominent pathological change in AD, characterized by the presence of gliosis and abundant pro-inflammatory cytokines in cortex and hippocampus. Song . found that the Aβ species stimulate DAPK1 activity in BV2 microglial cell line via activating the lysosomal cathepsin B [157], thereby promoting the generation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and subsequent cognitive impairments in vitro and in vivo [157]. Neuronal cell death is commonly observed during neural development and pathological conditions [158]. The programmed cell death in the developmental period contributes to the elimination of redundant neurons, which is crucial for the establishment of functional neural circuits and the maintenance of normal organ size [158]. The developmental cell death occurs in a spatiotemporally restricted and well-controlled manner to regulate the functional and structural homeostasis in the brain [159]. However, abnormal cell death in specific neuronal populations is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, and is closely associated with functional and structural impairments during disease progression [3]. For example, cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain are a primary cluster of neurons forming neural connections with the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala [160]. They regulate a wide range of physiological functions such as learning and memory, attention and emotion [161]. In pathological conditions such as AD, cholinergic neurons undergo irreversible degeneration and cell death, ultimately leading to brain atrophy and cognitive decline [162]. The specific spatial and temporal expression of DAPK1 in the brain implicates a potential role of DAPK1 in regulating neuronal cell apoptosis during neural development [39, 163], yet systematic research is needed to fully reveal the exact role of DAPK1 in early brain development. Surprisingly, we and others noticed that whole-body DAPK1 knockout (KO) in mouse has minimal influence on the overall lifespan and brain morphology [164]. Besides, DAPK1 KO or kinase activity deficiency in mice does not cause behavioral deficits [104, 165]. These findings indicate that the physiological role of DAPK1 in neural development might be compensated by other mechanisms in KO mouse models, but this needs further evidence. The dysregulation of DAPK1 in neuronal cell death was first demonstrated in ischemic stroke. Activated DAPK1 phosphorylates the Ser1303 residue of GluN2B at extrasynaptic sites, leading to enhanced NMDAR channel conductance and subsequent Ca2+ influx in neurons (Fig. 5a) [73]. Blocking DAPK1 rescues the Ca2+ overload-induced ischemic neuronal death and brain damage [73]. The excitotoxicity of GluN2B phosphorylation elicited by DAPK1 activation is also involved in neuronal loss caused by epilepsy, toxic Aβ treatment, stress-related depression and TBI insult [76, 77, 105, 109]. An earlier study demonstrated that DAPK1 binds to and phosphorylates p53 at the Ser23 residue. Upon the Ser23 phosphorylation, p53 translocates to the nucleus to initiate pro-apoptotic gene transcription. In addition, phosphorylated p53 also interacts with cyclophilin D in mitochondria and evokes mitochondrion-dependent necrosis (Fig. 5b) [101]. Previous studies have shown that DAPK1 can trigger both cell apoptosis and autophagic cell death [166]. A notable feature of DAPK1-induced cell death is cellular morphological changes such as membrane blebbing and cell protrusion, which are attributed to the phosphorylation of myosin-II light chain at Ser19 by DAPK1 and the subsequent alterations in cytoskeletal structure [166, 167]. We also identified N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) as a novel DAPK1 substrate in regulating neuronal cell death [168]. DAPK1 interacts with NDRG2 via its cytoskeleton-binding region, and directly phosphorylates the Ser350 of NDRG2 [168]. DAPK1-induced NDRG2 phosphorylation mediates the neuronal cell apoptosis triggered by Aβ species or ceramide through activating the caspase-3 pathway (Fig. 5c) [168]. Furthermore, NDRG2 phosphorylation at Ser350 is significantly elevated in the Tg2576 mouse model and in hippocampal tissues of AD patients. DAPK1 KO successfully reverses hippocampal neuronal loss in 8-month-old Tg2576 mice [168]. These findings support a causal role of DAPK1 dysregulation in AD-related neuronal cell death. Dysregulation of sphingomyelin has been suggested to be associated with the progression of cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy in AD [169]. Ceramide is a metabolite from enzymatic cleavage of sphingomyelin in neurons and regulates a broad range of cellular events including senescence, survival, and apoptosis [170]. Brain regions with degenerative phenotypes show elevated ceramide content. The accumulation of ceramide has been shown to activate DAPK1 by inducing PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of the Ser308 residue, thereby causing hippocampal neuronal death [171, 172]. In addition to sphingomyelin dyshomeostasis, the missense mutation (T835M) of the netrin receptor uncoordinated-5 homologue C (UNC5C) contributes to the risk of LOAD by increasing the vulnerability of neurons to cell death without affecting Aβ pathologies [173]. Hashimoto . demonstrated that the T835M-UNC5C interacts with DAPK1 via the respective death domain and induces pronounced cell death by activating the JNK/NADPH oxidase/caspase pathway [174]. Pharmacological inhibition of DAPK1 activity attenuates the T835M-UNC5C-induced cell death, suggesting that the interaction between UNC5C and DAPK1 may upregulate the catalytic activity of DAPK1 [174]. Indeed, it has been revealed that the Unc-5 homolog 2, a member of the UNC5 family, interacts with DAPK1 and recruits a subunit of PP2A to dephosphorylate the Ser308 residue of DAPK1, leading to DAPK1 activation and extensive cell death [175, 176]. Thus, these results all corroborate the fundamental role of DAPK1 in modulating neuronal cell death in the pathogenesis of AD. Synapses are the structural unit for neuronal communications and form the functional basis for neural circuits that are vital for brain function. The progressive degeneration of synapses in the brain is highly correlated with cognitive decline in AD [177], and is an emerging therapeutic target for disease-modifying treatment of AD. The high abundance of DAPK1 in adult hippocampal tissues and in particular its enrichment in dendritic spines indicate that DAPK1 may possess important physiological functions in regulating synaptic structure and plasticity [73, 164]. This has been confirmed by our recent quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of hippocampal tissues from WT and DAPK1 KO mice [178]. Glutamate receptors are one of the major modulators of the synaptic Ca2+ influx in neurons [179]. NMDARs dynamically change their subcellular localization, trafficking and expression levels in reaction to neuronal activities, and are believed to be critical for long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) [180]. Importantly, the DAPK1-induced Ser1303 phosphorylation of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit, which was originally reported to be detrimental in ischemic stroke, has essential physiological functions in modulating LTP and LTD (Fig. 6a) [181]. It has been revealed that DAPK1 and CaMKII differentially bind to GluN2B in LTD and LTP, respectively. LTP stimuli induce high levels of cellular Ca2+/CaM that can disrupt the binding between DAPK1 and GluN2B while facilitating the interaction between CaMKII and GluN2B. Besides, DAPK1 is dispersed from dendritic spines during LTP due to the transient depolymerization of F-actin [72, 181]. However, LTD stimuli trigger the calcineurin-mediated DAPK1 activation by dephosphorylating the Ser308 residue. This then causes an increase in the DAPK1–GluN2B interaction and subsequent phosphorylation of the Ser1303 residue, which retains DAPK1 in dendritic spines but prevents the access of CaMKII to GluN2B [72, 181]. It should be mentioned that the transient activation of DAPK1 is required for LTD induction under physiological conditions, which differs from the sustained upregulation of DAPK1 in ischemic stroke or AD [181]. Excessive DAPK1 in the synapse may prohibit the synaptic accumulation of CaMKII and result in LTP deficits in the brain. Aβ aggregates induce prolonged upregulation of DAPK1 in primary neurons [135], which may further mediate the NMDAR overactivation-induced Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and excitotoxicity in AD brains. Shu . demonstrated that DAPK1 is selectively activated in excitatory pyramidal neurons of the entorhinal cortical layer II region (ECIIPN) prior to the appearance of Aβ deposition [112]. The activation of DAPK1 in this brain region is strongly involved in synaptic dysfunction manifested by significantly reduced presynaptic terminals and dendritic spines, and disordered excitatory and inhibitory balance in CA1 region [112]. Inhibition of DAPK1 activity in ECIIPN potently improves the synaptic transmission and cognitive performance of AD mice [112]. Therefore, DAPK1 may contribute to synaptic degeneration during AD progression irrespective of the presence of Aβ species through different molecular mechanisms. DAPK1 has also been shown to interact with several presynaptic proteins including Caytaxin, Syntaxin-1A and α-synuclein (α-syn) [71, 108, 182]. For example, the upregulation of DAPK1 during brain ageing is associated with a downregulation of presynaptic Caytaxin levels, which is likely mediated by the DAPK1-induced caspase-3 activation [118]. A loss of Caytaxin expression significantly impairs the frequency and the amplitude of neuronal miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and weakens hippocampal LTP in vivo (Fig. 6b) [118]. Interestingly, the interaction between DAPK1 and Caytaxin also reciprocally inhibits the presynaptic DAPK1 activity and protects neurons against the ischemic stroke-induced apoptosis [182], representing an early protective mechanism by which neurons antagonize ischemic brain injuries. Syntaxin-1A is a basic component in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. It participates in the synaptic vesicle docking and fusion process by cooperating with other proteins in the SNARE complex [183, 184]. Tian . found that DAPK1 associates with the C-terminal half of Syntaxin-1A in the plasma membrane, and phosphorylates its Ser188 residue in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The phosphorylated Syntaxin 1A has reduced binding affinity to Munc18, while the assembly of the SNARE complex is not affected [71]. α-Syn is another binding partner of synaptic vesicles in neurons and is closely associated with the pathogenesis of PD. DAPK1 phosphorylates α-syn at the Ser129 residue, promoting the self-aggregation of α-syn into toxic species both in vitro and in vivo [82, 108]. However, it is not clear how the DAPK1-induced α-syn alteration modulates synaptic functions. Goodell . revealed that DAPK1 KO mice have comparable LTP strength to that of WT mice, while the LTD level is enhanced at a young age [164]. Functional studies demonstrated that DAPK1 KO mice have different presynaptic components in hippocampus compared with the WT mice, as evidenced by the increased paired-pulse ratio and reduced glutamate release probability in the hippocampus of KO mice [164]. Our transcriptomic analysis in DAPK1 KO and WT mice suggested that DAPK1 ablation globally changes the transcriptional profile in multiple brain regions and significantly regulates genes related to glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic pathways [185]. The potential involvement of DAPK1 in modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity hints that DAPK1 dysregulation in AD may additionally cause synaptic impairments. However, in vivo studies using both DAPK1 KO and transgenic AD mouse models are needed to fully address how DAPK1 is involved in synaptic deficits during AD progression. The progression of AD is also accompanied by gliosis, chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and autophagy deficiency [186]. The sustained activation of glial cells in the brain not only leads to an imbalance in pro- and anti-inflammatory signals, but also impairs the clearance of debris and protein aggregates, and disrupts synaptic integrity [187, 188]. Therefore, the management of gliosis represents a promising approach to counteracting neuroinflammatory response in AD [189]. Previous research indicated that DAPK1 expression is rather low or undetectable in glial cells at the embryonic stage [39]. However, the expression pattern of DAPK1 in glial cells in the adult brain or in response to external stimuli remains uncharacterized. Song . found that DAPK1 is expressed in the BV2 murine microglial cell line. The activity of DAPK1 but not its protein level can be upregulated by Aβ treatment in lipopolysaccharide-primed BV2 cells [157]. The activation of DAPK1 promotes the production of IL-1β and the initiation of caspase 1-mediated activation of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, further leading to memory deficits in mouse models [157]. The Aβ treatment-induced activation of DAPK1 may be attributed to the elevation of cytosolic cathepsin B, which is able to interact with DAPK1 and slow down the turnover of endogenous DAPK1 [157, 190]. Pharmacological inhibition of DAPK1 activity attenuates the Aβ-induced NLRP3 activation and cognitive impairment in vivo. These findings implicate that modulating DAPK1 function in microglia might have protective effects on AD-related chronic neuroinflammation. In addition to regulating the inflammatory response, microglia are also actively involved in maintaining brain homeostasis by executing phagocytosis of redundant synapses, damaged cells, myelin debris and protein aggregates [191]. It has been demonstrated that the autophagy-lysosomal system, an essential cellular machinery for the phagocytosis process, is impaired in the microglia of AD mouse models [192–194]. DAPK1 is an upstream regulator of cellular autophagy that directly interacts with proteins involved in the autophagy machinery. For instance, DAPK1 phosphorylates the Thr119 of Beclin1, and thus facilitates the release of Beclin1 from Bcl-X L to initiate the autophagy process [195, 196]. Besides, it has been reported that DAPK1 forms a stable complex with MAP1B in cells subjected to starvation. MAP1B is indispensable for DAPK1-induced autophagosome accumulation and membrane blebbing [197, 198]. Oikonomou . discovered a novel role of DAPK1 in affecting the LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP, also known as noncanonical autophagy) in fungal infection-related inflammation by modulating the formation of autophagosomes [199]. Interestingly, the LAP is an essential part of microglial phagocytosis in the brain. Chen . demonstrated that DAPK1 is also involved in the regulation of LAP in the microglia using an in vitro subarachnoid hemorrhage model by exposing microglial cells to oxyhemoglobin [200]. Oxyhemoglobin suppresses microglial LAP by upregulating p38 and downregulating DAPK1, further resulting in a reduction of cellular Beclin1 expression [200]. These data concomitantly support a crucial role of DAPK1 in cellular autophagy. Nevertheless, whether DAPK1 dysregulation is associated with autophagy impairment in AD is yet unresolved. Only one study reported that Aβ treatment activates neuronal DAPK1 and triggers autophagosome formation and apoptosis sequentially in primary neurons [156]. Importantly, neurons with high amounts of autophagosomes are devoid of apoptotic phenotypes [156], which suggests that the DAPK1-inducced autophagy might confer protection in AD. Taken together, the function of DAPK1 in microglia appears to be contradictory, as DAPK1 activation may stimulate inflammatory response, but it may also enhance autophagy to maintain cellular homeostasis. Given the multiple roles of DAPK1 dysregulation in the pathogenesis of AD, DAPK1 has been an emerging target for the development of novel disease-modifying therapies for AD. Several types of molecule, including synthetic compounds, natural product-derived chemicals and peptide-based modulators have been tested in mouse models to evaluate the therapeutic potential of DAPK1 inhibition in various neuropathologies [201]. The first small-molecule DAPK1 inhibitor was identified by screening a library of compounds, leading to the discovery of an aminopyridazine with a weak DAPK1 inhibitory effect [202]. Further structural optimization of the lead compounds resulted in the generation of two 3-amino-6-phenylpyridazine derivatives with remarkably improved inhibition and selectivity for DAPK1 (IC50 = ~ 15 μM) [202]. These compounds have a common 6-phenyl group and competitively bind to the ATP-binding pocket of DAPK1. An in vivo study using a hypoxic ischemia rat model demonstrated that a single intraperitoneal injection of the candidate compound successfully ameliorated brain weight loss and preserved microtubule-associated proteins in the brain [202]. Okamoto . performed a structure-based virtual screening using the structures of target protein kinases, and identified a series of compounds with a common scaffold of 2-phenyl-4-(3-pyridinylmethylene)-5(4H)-oxazolone [203]. The pyridinyl group, the oxazolone ring and the phenyl ring in the scaffold are all essential for the inhibition of DAPK1 and DAPK3 activities based on the structure–activity relationship analysis [203]. More importantly, compounds with this scaffold are highly selective for DAPKs, facilitating the discovery of molecules with improved affinity. To discover novel DAPK1 inhibitors, Okamoto . carried out a multiple-step virtual screening, in which they first generated several binding-site models using molecular dynamics simulation to select structures with the highest enrichment, and then large-scale screening was performed based on the enriched DAPK1 structure [204]. Following the discovery of the lead compound, in vitro kinase assays and similarity search of more potent compounds were performed to obtain the optimal chemicals. This led to the discovery of 4-(pyridin-3-ylmethylene)oxazol-5(4H)-one (C6) [204], a highly efficient inhibitor for DAPK1 and DAPK3 (IC50 = 69 and 225 nM, respectively). This compound has been widely used in animal studies due to its strong inhibitory effect and high specificity for DAPK1. For example, we have shown that C6 is capable of reducing the secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the low nanomolar range [78]. Besides, C6 effectively prevents the ceramide- and Aβ aggregate-induced neuronal cell death [168]. In an epileptic mouse model, C6 treatment protected against the PTZ-induced seizures by diminishing the DAPK1-induced GluN2B phosphorylation [76]. Feng . designed a group of octahedral pyridocarbazole metal complexes based on the structure of the pan-kinase inhibitor Staurosporine [205]. The specific inhibitor OS4 contains ruthenium in the 1,4,7-trithiacycloalkane scaffold. Crystallographic analysis revealed extensive interactions between OS4 and the catalytic domain of DAPK1, including hydrogen bonds between the maleimide moiety and the hinge region of DAPK1, hydrophobic interactions between the 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane ligand group and the ATP-binding site and glycine-rich loop of DAPK1, and the occupation of the pyridocarbazole heterocycle in the adenine pocket of DAPK1 [205]. The IC50 values of OS4 for DAPK1 and DAPK3 are 2 and 8.8 nM, respectively. In addition, it preferentially inhibited DAPK1 activity with a selective factor higher than 4.4 in the kinase screening assay [205]. Carlson . applied a fluorescence-linked enzyme chemoproteomic strategy and found that HS38, a selective pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidinone, can potently suppress DAPK1 and DAPK3 with an IC50 of about 200 nM [206]. The inhibition of DAPK3 by HS38 leads to reduced contractile force in mouse aorta and calyculin A-stimulated arterial muscle via decreasing the phosphorylation of regulatory myosin light chain (RLC20) [206]. Nevertheless, it is not clear how this compound regulates DAPK1 activity in ischemic stroke or other neurological disease models. Singh . conducted virtual screening and molecular simulations to identify compounds that can simultaneously occupy the ATP-binding site and the substrate recognition site of DAPK1, which led to the discovery of the compound 11 as a promising inhibitor that directly interacts with the Glu100 and Glu143 residues of DAPK1 [207]. Furthermore, the prediction of drug-likeness also showed higher druggability and safety profile of the compound 11 than other compounds [207]. To target neuronal tauopathy, Farag . designed a dual inhibitor for DAPK1 and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) with a 3,5-dimethoxy-N-(4-(4-methoxyphenoxy)-2-((6-morpholinopyridin-3-yl)amino)pyrimidin-5-yl)benzamide structure [208]. This compound suppresses DAPK1 activity in a non-ATP competitive manner, as it binds to the substrate-binding site rather than the ATP-binding pocket of DAPK1. The IC50 value slightly decreased from 2.89 to 0.92 μM with the increase of ATP concentration in the in vitro kinase assay [208]. In addition, it also strongly inhibits the activity of CSF1R by competing with ATP. In vitro evaluation proved that the compound efficiently suppresses tau aggregation and lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation [208]. This compound is also highly selective toward DAPK1, despite the sequence homology between DAPK1 and other DAPK family members [208]. Moreover, this molecule might show encouraging neuroprotective effects due to its high BBB permeability and brain bioavailability [208]. Recently, rational design and synthesis of aryl carboxamide derivatives have led to the generation of an isonicotinamide derivative 4q as a promising DAPK1 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 1.09 μM [209]. The compound has been tested for anti-cancer activity in leukemia and breast cancer, while its effects on neuropathologies remain to be investigated [209]. Similarly, some 6,8,9-poly-substituted purine derivatives have been able to prevent leukemia cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by suppressing DAPK1 activity. Further structure optimization led to the discovery of 6-benzyloxy-9-tert-butyl-8-phenyl-9H-purine (compound 6d), an efficient DAPK1 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 2.5 μM [210]. Wilbek . performed high-throughput screening of novel DAPK1 inhibitors by applying a microfluidic capillary electrophoresis assay based on the DAPK1-induced specific phosphorylation of the Ser1303 residue of DAPK1 [211]. The identified compound (CPR005231) binds to the ATP pocket of DAPK1 at nanomolar concentrations and has an IC50 of 247 nM for DAPK1 [211]. However, this compound also inhibits the protein-tyrosine kinase Src at a similar IC50 [211]. Firoz . performed an in silico study aimed at obtaining DAPK1 inhibitors for the treatment of retinal degeneration, as studies suggested that DAPK1 contributes to ophthalmic disorders in large part by regulating the programmed cell death. They found several caspase inhibitor analogs with good inhibitory effects and promising drug-likeness properties [212]. In conclusion, a number of in silico studies have been performed to discover specific DAPK1 inhibitors, and indeed compounds with different scaffolds have been identified and tested in in vitro kinase assays. Although many studies usually include drug-likeness prediction which could provide some hints for further in vivo evaluation, animal experiments are urgently needed to better determine the effectiveness, pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of these small-molecule DAPK1 inhibitors. Natural compounds represent an important resource for the discovery of therapeutic chemicals for various neurological diseases. Flavonoids are widely distributed bioactive molecules in nature and possess diverse biological effects such as anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammation by interacting with key signaling molecules in the cell [213]. Yokoyama . first measured the binding affinity of 17 natural flavonoids to DAPK1 using the 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) competitive assay. Of all the tested flavonoids, morin, a natural polyphenol abundantly found in Moraceae species, showed the highest binding affinity toward the DAPK1 catalytic domain (IC50 = 1.6 ± 0.27 μM) in the ANS assay [214]. Crystallographic analysis revealed that these flavonoids mainly bind to the ATP pocket of DAPK1. In particular, it has been found that the 2’–OH of morin forms strong ionic interaction with the K42 residue of DAPK1, which underlies the robust inhibitory effect of morin on DAPK1 activity. Resveratrol is a polyphenol ubiquitously found in grapes. It is a well-known dietary supplement due to its cardiovascular protective activity. Resveratrol directly binds to the ATP pocket of DAPK1 with an apparent dissociation constant of 8.5 μM [215, 216]. Specifically, the phenyl ring (A-ring) of resveratrol anchors at the adenyl base of ATP and the 3-OH group forms hydrogen bonds with the hinge region of DAPK1 [215]. Based on the binding mode, Yokoyama . further characterized several resveratrol derivatives using conventional biophysical approaches. Thermodynamic analysis of the binding suggested that the interaction between resveratrol derivatives and DAPK1 is mainly driven by favorable enthalpy changes due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions [216]. These derivatives all dock to the ATP pocket of DAPK1, and additional hydrogen bonds can be formed in the hinge region of DAPK1 [216]. A similar binding mode was reported for Purpurin, an anthraquinone isolated from the roots of Rubia cordifolia, for its interaction with DAPK1 [217]. The IC50 value of Purpurin for DAPK1 was determined to be 890 nM [217]. Talwar . carried out virtual screening in combination with in vitro kinase assay to discover DAPK1 inhibitors from the ZINC database [218]. The compound-N4 binds to the ATP pocket and the substrate recognition site of DAPK1 [218]. Quercetin is a ubiquitously distributed BBB-permeable flavonoid. Qi . identified DAPK1 as a downstream target of Quercetin using a systematic approach [219]. Very interestingly, they observed that HT-22 cells treated with Aβ species showed an increase in DAPK1 mRNA expression which is consistent with their microarray analysis of the GSE5281 dataset, and Quercetin treatment dramatically suppressed this increase [219]. This finding indicates that Quercetin is likely beneficial for ischemic stroke and AD by indirectly targeting DAPK1. In all, although biophysical and crystallographic data support the idea that these natural compounds directly bind to DAPK1, it remains elusive whether these molecules indeed exert protective effects through inhibiting DAPK1 in vitro and in vivo. There are also natural compounds that can upregulate DAPK1 function in cells. For instance, Sanggenon C is able to decrease the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mind-bomb 1 (Mib1, also known as DIP-1), an important binding partner controlling the degradation of DAPK1 in the cell [52, 53]. Sanggenon C upregulates the cellular DAPK1 level by stabilizing the protein, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in glioblastoma model [220]. Grifolin has been reported to upregulate the cellular p53 function and promote the transcription and expression of DAPK1 in breast cancer cell lines, thus promoting cancer cell death [221]. Curcumin has also been shown to cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells by upregulating DAPK1 transcription and its protein level [222]. Notably, these data are mostly obtained using cancer cell lines and it is not clear whether these molecules also show similar effects in neuronal cells. Many of the biological functions of DAPK1 are mediated by its cellular substrates. Specific amino acids or sequences involved in the recognition and binding events can therefore be utilized to design peptide-based blockers to interfere with DAPK1 dysregulation-induced pathological changes. This method has several advantages over small-molecule inhibitors. First, peptide-based blockers are highly selective and specific toward the protein targets and their substrates. Second, peptide-based blockers can be easily modified to increase the inhibition potency and biological diversity [223]. Third, the metabolism of peptides generates amino acids with low cellular toxicities [224]. Nevertheless, peptides are susceptible to rapid proteolysis and insufficient membrane penetration in vivo, which hinder their translational applications in neurological diseases [225]. In this part, we will discuss the use of blocking peptides as a tool to specifically disrupt DAPK1–substrate interactions for disease intervention. The blocking peptide approach was initially employed by Tu . to block the interaction between DAPK1 and GluN2B in an ischemic stroke mouse model [73]. In their study, the direct binding sequence of GluN2B (1292–1304 aa) was fused to the cell-membrane transduction domain of the HIV-1 Tat protein (Tat-NR2BCT) [73]. This peptide completely abolished the interaction between DAPK1 and GluN2B in neurons, thereby resulting in reduced GluN2B phosphorylation and subsequent Ca2+ influx in mouse brain [73]. Furthermore, the Tat-NR2B CT treatment was sufficient to improve ischemic stroke-induced brain infarction and chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in vivo [73, 109]. The same group also identified a minimal binding sequence in the DNA-binding motif of p53 that is responsible for the interaction with the death domain of DAPK1. The fragment was conjugated with the cell-membrane transduction domain of Tat protein to generate a blocking peptide Tat-p53DM, which has been shown to suppress DAPK1-induced p53 phosphorylation in cortical neurons subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation [101]. Moreover, intravenous injection of the peptide not only rescued brain infarction and neuronal cell death, but also reversed motor deficits in ischemic stroke mouse model [150]. The interaction between DAPK1 and tau can also be prevented by using a membrane-permeable peptide containing the minimal tau-binding sequence [100]. The peptide can cross the BBB when administered intravenously. It is capable of ameliorating stroke-induced dendritic spine damage and cognitive injuries by attenuating the DAPK1-induced tau phosphorylation in neurons [100]. Inspired by this, our group also developed a specific blocking peptide (Tat-DM) for the interaction between ERK and DAPK1. This peptide interrupts ERK-induced DAPK1 phosphorylation at Ser735 by uncoupling the binding between these two proteins, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of DAPK1 [77]. Treatment of Tat-DM successfully reduced neuronal apoptosis and suppressed seizure severity in KA-induced mouse epilepsy model in vivo by downregulating DAPK1 activity in the brain [77]. These data together demonstrate the promising application of peptide-based DAPK1 modulators in the intervention of neurological diseases. They are not only robust tools for research purposes, but also possess translational potential for clinical applications. However, peptides usually suffer from low biostability and poor BBB permeability in vivo, which strongly limit the bioavailability and efficacy of peptide-based therapeutics in human brains [226]. Strategies such as peptidomimetics, chemical modifications and bionanotechnology-based delivery systems might be applied to overcome these drawbacks [223]. Protein kinases are valuable therapeutic targets for the intervention of AD, not only due to the direct participation of dysregulated kinases in various AD pathologies, but also because of the vast number of chemicals and strategies available for drug development [227]. Compounds targeting GSK-3β, CDK5, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK3 or several tyrosine kinases have been evaluated in AD mouse models, and some of them have reached clinical trials [228]. For instance, short-term (10 weeks) treatment of lithium, a GSK-3β inhibitor, had no impact on CSF biomarkers and cognitive performance in AD patients. However, a prolonged treatment of lithium (over 12 months) in patients with mild cognitive impairment led to improved cognitive function and reduced tau phosphorylation with favorable safety profiles [229, 230]. Tideglusib, another GSK-3β inhibitor that has been evaluated in a 26-week, multicenter phase II clinical trial, also demonstrated positive effects on cognitive performance in patients with mild AD [231]. Other kinase inhibitors such as Neflamapimod for p38 MAPK and NE3107 for ERK1/2 are being analyzed in AD patients and have shown promising results in phase II clinical trials [227]. However, CDK5 or JNK3 inhibitors are less investigated in clinical trials although these kinases play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD. CDK5 and JNK3 are crucial for cellular signaling transduction, meaning that non-selective suppression of the activities of the kinases may induce toxic rather than therapeutic effects in AD patients [232]. The extensive involvement of DAPK1 in regulating multiple AD pathological changes makes it an ideal target for the development of disease-modifying treatments for AD. Indeed, several synthetic DAPK1 inhibitors and blocking peptides have already been exploited in AD or stroke mouse models for disease intervention. The neuroprotective effect of DAPK1 inhibition on ischemic stroke has been systematically summarized by Khan . [233]. In their study, they compared the effects of different approaches in inhibiting neuronal DAPK1 function, including gene knockout, post-transcriptional silencing by miRNAs, kinase inhibitors and blocking peptides, and concluded that post-transcriptional regulators and blocking peptides provide better functional outcomes than other methods [233]. However, it remains to be determined whether this also applies to chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Besides, structure-based virtual screening and high-throughput screening are continuously conducted to identify new molecular entities with potent inhibitory effect and high selectivity for DAPK1. Nevertheless, most of the compounds are only evaluated for the IC50 values and binding affinities using in vitro assays. Whether the candidate compounds show direct target engagement in animal models remains to be studied. Although several DAPK1 inhibitors have been evaluated in animal models and show promising neuroprotective effects on ischemic stroke and epilepsy [234], the pharmacological profiles of these candidates are yet to be systematically evaluated. Besides, whether the lead compounds are effective in improving neuropathological changes and behavioral performance in chronic disease models such as AD and PD remains uncharacterized. Moreover, none of the aforementioned DAPK1 modulators have been tested in clinical trials to date [201]. Based on the lessons from clinical research on other kinase inhibitors, we propose several key points in the development of DAPK1 modulators for disease-modifying treatment of AD. First, DAPK1 is an important tumor suppressor gene that is downregulated in a wide range of cancers [235]. Non-selective inhibition of DAPK1 in tissues without DAPK1 dysregulation may cause unwanted side effects, which highlights the necessity of designing brain-specific DAPK1 inhibitors for disease intervention. Second, the BBB may limit the penetration of chemicals into the brain parenchyma, thus reducing the effective concentration of the compound in the brain. Therefore, increasing the BBB permeability to of compounds is an important aspect in compound screening and structural optimization. Third, the currently available DAPK1 inhibitors mostly bind to the ATP pocket of DAPK1 in the kinase domain, which is highly homologous among DAPK family proteins. It would be helpful to design molecules with additional interacting patterns, such as the substrate recognition motif to obtain more selective and specific inhibitors. This could also avoid the undesirable inhibition of other types of protein kinases in the cell. In all, given that the neuropathologies in AD generally require long-term interventions, DAPK1 modulators with balanced efficacy, safety property and favorable pharmacological profiles should be developed for further preclinical and clinical studies. AD is an ageing-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The Ca2+/CaM-dependent Ser/Thr kinase DAPK1 has been implicated in neuronal loss in ischemic stroke, TBI and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that DAPK1 is a promising therapeutic target for the disease-modifying treatment of AD. First, DAPK1 is highly expressed in adult hippocampus, a brain region that is particularly vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathologies during AD progression. Our research has also established a causal link between DAPK1 dysregulation and core AD neuropathologies, supporting DAPK1 as a common upstream regulator of Aβ generation and tau hyperphosphorylation in AD. Second, in addition to Aβ and tau pathologies, DAPK1 has been suggested to affect neuronal cell death and synaptic function in the brain, two events that are directly connected with the structural and functional integrity of the brain. The multifunctional role of DAPK1 is closely associated with different neuropathological changes in AD, making it possible to achieve comprehensive treatment by targeting one protein. Third, there are already synthetic and natural product-derived compounds available for further identification and evaluation of DAPK1 inhibitors. Moreover, some compounds have been assessed in vivo and shown promising effects in AD mouse models, which could offer additional insights into the design and optimization of molecules with improved efficacy and safety profiles. Additionally, to better understand the exact contribution of DAPK1 dysregulation to the pathophysiological changes of AD, several key issues need to be solved. For example, how do the expression and activity of DAPK1 change along the disease progression of AD? Can we develop DAPK1 as an early diagnostic marker for the clinical assessment of AD progression? Does DAPK1 interact with other AD risk factors such as ApoE and TREM2 in the pathogenesis of AD and how? What is the pathophysiological role of DAPK1 in glial cells and how is this associated with AD pathologies? We believe that answering these questions is as important as the development of specific DAPK1 modulators for disease intervention, and will definitely deepen our knowledge about the physiological and pathological roles of DAPK1 in the brain.",10714,15.pdf

Seeking causal contributors to both these phenomena, we pursued changes in transfer RNS (tRNA) fragments (tRFs) targeting cholinergic transcripts (CholinotRFs). Methods: We analyzed small RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) brain region which is enriched in cholinergic neurons, compared to hypothalamic or cortical tissues from AD brains; and explored small RNA expression in neuronal cell lines undergoing cholinergic differentiation. Results: NAc CholinotRFs of mitochondrial genome origin showed reduced levels that correlated with elevations in their predicted cholinergic-associated mRNA targets. Single-cell RNA seq from AD temporal cortices showed altered sex-specific levels of cholinergic transcripts in diverse cell types; inversely, human-originated neuroblastoma cells under cholinergic differentiation presented sex-specific CholinotRF elevations. Discussion: Our findings support CholinotRFs contributions to cholinergic regulation, predicting their involvement in AD sex-specific cholinergic loss and dementia.",152,16.pdf
46,Sex‐specific declines in cholinergic‐targeting tRNA fragments in the nucleus accumbens in Alzheimer's disease,2023,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13095,introduction,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, globally affecting over 50 million people.1 Its clinical symptoms reflect accelerating failure of regulatory, neurochemical, and neural networks, initiating with the cholinergic system and leading to a progressive cognitive deterioration. Neuropathologic features in subcortical nuclei2 precede neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) development within the mesial temporal cortex.3 AD lesions involve accumulation of multimeric amyloid-β fibrils forming neuritic plaques and NFTs consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau and leading to loss of synapses, dendrites, and, eventually, neurons.1 However, the mechanisms underlying AD-related dementia, which develops relatively late in the disease course4 are a matter of controversy.5 Clustered cholinergic neurons in the substantia innominate/nucleus basalis of Meynert6 are the most investigated site of acetylcholine (Ach) producing interneurons within the nucleus accumbens (Nac). They contribute to cognitive and motivational behavior and loss of these neurons predicts progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. This is faster in females even when considering their longer life expectancy.7–9 Females score lower than males on tests of cognitive domains,10 even after controlling for possible demographic and genetic factors, and show more pronounced mitochondrial imbalances11 and loss of cholinergic neurons.12 The reduced cholinergic activity in basal cholinergic forebrain neurons and their cortical projection sites supports the “cholinergic hypothesis of AD,”13 which argues that dysfunction of Ach-producing brain neurons contributes to the AD-related cognitive decline. Consequently, the development of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) is one of the few treatments for AD.14 ChEIs do not prevent or slow disease progression. They may independently lead to cognitive dysfunction and delirium,15 are more effective in males and cause more pronounced adverse effects in females with AD.7,16 Additionally, muscarinic agonists have shown some clinical promise, and modulate various impairments seen in AD, affecting both the cortical cholinergic basal forebrain system and the 1%–2% of Nac Ach-producing neurons17 that project to brain regions including cortical areas.18 Correspondingly, dysfunction of cholinergic pathways in both the basal forebrain and the Nac contribute to cognitive decline in AD.19,20 Both whole tissue and single-cell AD studies revealed changes in coding and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcript levels, but their involvement in cholinergic cellular dysfunction remained unknown. Those included microRNAs (miRs), small single-stranded ncRNAs about 22 nucleotides long that target mRNA molecules and function as post-transcriptional regulators.21 Therefore, individual miR levels are co-altered in the AD brain with their experimentally validated targets.22 Furthermore, sex-specific miR profiles modulate responses to tau pathology23 and sex- and age-related Ach signals24 in AD, yielding sex-specific biomarkers for multiple neurodegenerative disorders.25 However, Nac AD miRs remain under-investigated. Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived fragments (tRFs) are a recently rediscovered small non-coding RNA regulators that were previously considered to be inactive products of tRNA degradation. The tRFs are derived by specific tRNA cleavage of several different nucleases, including Dicer, Drosha, and Angiogenin26 (Figure 1). All tRFs up to 30 nucleotides in length may function like miRs by modulating the expression of mRNA targets carrying complementary sequence motifs.26 In nucleated blood cells, tRFs targeting cholinergic transcripts replace miRs in regulating cholinergic reactions during ischemic stroke.27 Moreover, certain tRFs regulate ribosomal function, cancer, innate immunity, stress responses, and neurological disorders.28 The tRFs may originate from nuclear or mitochondrial genomes26 and mitochondrial disfunction is a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.8 While AD involves changes in miRs targeting mitochondrial genes,29 the role of mitochondrial-originated tRFs in cholinergic neurons, as well as their sex-specific profiles and genetic origins in AD have not yet been investigated. Pursuing cholinergic-targeting tRFs and/or miRs (CholinotRFs, CholinomiRs) that may affect AD pathology and its disease course and cognitive decline, we sought changes in their predicted mRNA targets in AD and healthy non-cognitively impaired elderly control cases; examined the specific cell populations that express these cholinergic mRNA targets in single-cell RNA-Seq from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and studied the role of CholinotRFs in cholinergic regulation in cell lines of human origin.",640,16.pdf
47,Sex‐specific declines in cholinergic‐targeting tRNA fragments in the nucleus accumbens in Alzheimer's disease,2023,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13095,result,"3.1 NAc CholinotRFs decline in AD females To identify disease- and sex-specific changes in the NAc sncRNA profiles, we analyzed small RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of aged donors with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. The cholinergic hypothesis of AD states that dysfunction of ACh-producing brain neurons contributes to the cognitive decline. Therefore, we classified the donors according to their clinical diagnosis: controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI) (65; 35 females, 30 males) and persons diagnosed with AD (47; 28 females and 19 males) (Methods, TableS1).31–33 To find AD-associated changes in short tRFs, we applied a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test on control and AD short RNA-Seq reads (Methods). We found substantial differences in the levels of sncRNAs between males and females. Specifically, in females, we identified 10 tRFs with altered levels (FDR corrected p ≤ 0.152) (FigureS1, TableS3). In males, by contrast, no significant alterations in tRFs were found (Figure2A). AD involves the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques. However, their link to cognitive decline is unclear.4 Therefore, we asked to what extent changes in short tRFs and miRs will manifest when AD is classified according to these neuropathological features, rather than the level of cognitive decline (TableS1). When classifying the donors according to neuritic plaques we found no significant differences in the levels of sncRNAs (FigureS2A, Methods). When classifying them according to NFTs, we identified only a single tRF that significantly differed between the two groups (FigureS2B, TableS4, Methods). These results support the use of cognitive impairment rather than neuropathology as a measure of disease severity. Based on the cholinergic hypothesis, we hypothesized that the AD-related changes in tRFs will be particularly pronounced in those tRFs containing complementary sequences to cholinergic genes. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a list of 58 genes associated with ACh production and cholinergic regulation (TableS10, denoted as “ACh Production” or “Cholinergic Regulation,”37–50 based on our previous work43), of which seven genes were denoted as “Core”38,43 genes based on their key roles in the cholinergic pathway (TableS10). For each sncRNA, we used the microT prediction tool to find its cholinergic targets.35 This identified approximately a quarter of sncRNAs likely to be involved in ACh production and cholinergic regulation (Methods). Focusing on tRFs whose level was significantly altered in AD compared to control state, 6 of the 10 tRFs altered in females were CholinotRFs, while only 25% of all the tRFs (98/401) were identified as CholinotRFs (p <0.02) (Methods). The levels of all six significant NAc CholinotRFs were reduced in AD females (p <0.02). We were therefore wondering whether this reduction is only the tip of an iceberg and reflects a more general reduction in the level of CholinotRFs, including in those tRFs that did not cross the significance level. Indeed, in females, the level of 74% (68/92) of the remaining (no significant change) CholinotRFs was lower in the AD than in the control state, while the level of only 26% (24/92) was higher (p < 3 × 10−6). By contrast, no such reduction was observed in the non-CholinotRFs (36%, 108/303 decreased; 64%, 195/303 increased). A similar tendency, to lesser extent, was also observed in males: 70% (68/97) of CholinotRFs decreased and 30% (31/97) of CholinotRFs increased (p <5 ×10−5); 47% (135/288) of non-CholinotRFs decreased and 53% (153/288) of non-CholinotRFs increased. Caution should be exercised when interpreting this result, because the classification of tRFs into CholinotRFs and non-CholinotRFs is correlated with their origin, mitochondrial (MT) or nuclear (non-MT). For example, in females, 82% (80/97) of the CholinotRFs are also MT-tRFs, whereas only 10% (29/303) of the non-CholinotRFs are also MT-tRFs. We, therefore, used logistic regression to test whether the potential function of a tRF (CholinotRF vs. non-CholinotRF) is correlated with its reduction in AD, even when its origin (MT vs. non-MT) is accounted for (Methods). The regression coefficients indicate that both in females and in males, the potential function of a studied tRF as cholinergic regulator is correlated with its reduction in the AD NAc (females: regression coefficient 1.1, p < 1 × 10−4; males: regression coefficient 1.1, p <9 ×10−4), whereas the regression coefficient for the origin was not statistically significant (females: regression coefficient 0.006, p <0.98; males: regression coefficient−0.25, p <0.35), indicating that the effect in MT-tRFs derived from their potential function as cholinergic regulators. 3.2 tRF decline is more pronounced in the NAc than in other brain regions It is important to note that only a small fraction of NAc neurons is cholinergic, limiting the interpretation of the RNA-Seq data that were derived from a heterogenous population of NAc neurons. To test whether the change in tRFs reflects changes in the NAc cholinergic neurons, we repeated the analysis in two additional brain regions, the STG and hypothalamus. The STG is a cortical region that was previously linked to AD, presenting epigenetic modifications in persons with AD according to their pathogenesis,53 whereas the hypothalamus is a subcortical region that is relatively spared.54 We classified small-RNA profiles extracted from the STG and hypothalamus of controls (STG: 11 females, 11 males; hypothalamus: 15 females, 11 males) and donors diagnosed with AD (STG: 10 females, 6 males; hypothalamus: 20 females, 10 males) (TableS1). In the STG, we identified only 2 tRFs whose levels are significantly changed in females between the control and AD groups. None of these tRFs was a CholinotRF (TableS5). In the hypothalamus, we did not find any tRFs that differed between the two groups. In agreement with these results, the reduction in the global level of CholinotRFs was modest, statistically significant only for males in the STG and females in the hypothalamus (STG females: 57%, 55/97, p < 0.11, males: 62%, 65/104, p < 7 × 10−3; hypothalamus females: 58%, 54/93, p < 0.07; males: 40%, 36/92, p < 0.99). These findings lend support to the potential cholinergic relevance of our NAc observations. While the dorsomedial portion of the hypothalamus contains cholinergic neurons,54 our findings in the hypothalamus part that is non-cholinergic were compatible with the link between the altered tRFs in the NAc and their functional relevance to cholinergic neurons. 3.3 AD-related changes in miR levels differ substantially from AD-related changes in tRFs Many studies have reported post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRs.14,21,27 Therefore, if the changes in tRFs merely reflect changes in the fraction of cholinergic neurons (as a result of cell death) then a similar pattern of change in miRs is expected in AD. However, miRs exhibited very different behaviors from those of tRFs. While substantial changes in the levels of tRFs were observed in the in NAc of AD females, but not males, the opposite pattern was observed in miRs. In males, we identified 13 miRs whose levels were significantly altered between the AD and control groups (Figure2B, TableS6), while only a single miR was significantly altered in females (TableS7). Intriguingly, the single significantly reduced miR in the NAc of AD females was a CholinomiR (the well-studied AChE-targeting miR-132-3p24), while 5 of the 13 significantly altered miRs in AD males were CholinomiRs. Similarly, inverse changes were seen in the population of CholinomiRs (Methods): while 84 of 144 (58%) CholinomiRs were reduced in the NAc of AD males (p <0.03), 56% of CholinomiRs in the NAc of females were elevated (80/143, p <0.09). In the STG, we identified only a single miR, which was not a CholinomiR whose level was significantly reduced in AD females (Figure2B, TableS8). At the population level, 58% (93/160) of the CholinomiRs were significantly reduced in AD females (P<0.03), while CholinomiRs reduction was not significant in AD males (50%, 84/168, p <0.53). In the hypothalamus, we identified a single miR, which was not a CholinomiR, whose level was significantly reduced in AD males (TableS9). At the population level, CholinomiRs were more significantly reduced in females (62%, 85/138, p < 4 × 10−3) than in males (56%, 79/141, p <0.09). Taken together, these findings point at a complex network of gene expression regulation that differs between tRFs and miRs, between females and males and between brain regions. We find substantial sex-specific differences in the regulation of the cholinergic system in the NAc. These include substantial changes in CholinotRFs in AD females, but almost no changes in CholinomiRs, while the opposite trend, substantial changes in miRs and less so in CholinotRFs, were observed in males with AD. 3.4 Low CholinotRF levels in the NAc of AD females are correlated with elevated levels of cholinergic mRNAs Short tRFs are likely to interact with and suppress the translatability of mRNAs carrying complementary sequences21,22,26 (Figure 1). Therefore, we hypothesized that a reduction in the levels of CholinotRFs in the NAc of AD females will be accompanied by elevated levels of cholinergic mRNAs. To test this prediction, we used a permutation test to identify those genes, out of the 58 genes associated with ACh production and cholinergic regulation37–50 (TableS10), whose levels were significantly modified in AD compared to control groups (Methods). Consistent with our hypothesis, the levels of 93% (13/14 genes) of the significantly altered mRNAs associated with ACh-production and cholinergic regulation were elevated in females (p <9 ×10−4). In comparison, in males only seven genes displayed altered levels, and they were all elevated (p <8 ×10−3). Next, we focused our attention on the specific CholinotRFs that exhibited a significant reduction in the NAc of AD females (6/98). Of these 6 tRFs, 5 shared similar targets. Therefore, while each of these CholinotRFs targeted 15–16 cholinergic targets, together they targeted only 18 targets (out of the 58 cholinergic genes). This similarity in targets was due to the fact that all 5 tRFs originated from the same tRNA (mitochondria-derived PheGAA) (Figure3A, TableS3, Methods). We hypothesized that the levels of these 18 targets will be particularly affected in females with AD. Indeed, the mRNA levels of 33.3% (6/18) of the cholinergic targets of these CholinotRFs were significantly increased in AD females compared to controls. Considering the remaining 40 cholinergic genes, only 17.5% (7/40) exhibited a significant increase in AD females (p <0.08). In comparison, in males only 6% (1/18) of the target genes and 15% (6/40) of the non-targeted genes were significantly increased. Previous studies have linked the six significantly elevated target mRNAs reported here with AD or related pathways. For example, RORA is elevated in the AD hippocampus,55 and is genetically linked to AD56 (p <0.06, 0.39 for females and males, respectively); PCYT1A is elevated in the AD hippocampus compared to controls57 (p <3 ×10−4, 0.01); KLF4 and LIFR were suggested to serve as AD therapy targets based on bioinformatic analyses of therapeutic pathways58,59 (KLF4: p < 0.09, 0.90; LIFR: p < 0.06, 0.98); also, RORA, KLF4, and KLF7 (p < 0.06, 0.27) are regulators of the circadian rhythm,42,60,61 a process that affects cholinergic differentiation and activity,19 and which notably deteriorates in AD; and BMP2 regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway which is dysfunctional in several diseases, including AD62 (p <0.03, 0.22). Therefore, these findings supported our working hypothesis that sncRNAs in the NAc may operate as regulators of cholinergic associated genes and contribute to the female-specific disease expression. 3.5 Unexpected changes in STG and hypothalamus cholinergic mRNAs Compared with the NAc, AD-associated changes in cholinergic sncRNAs in the hypothalamus and STG were modest. Therefore, we expected to see fewer AD-related changes in hypothalamus and STG cholinergic mRNAs in general and no elevation in these genes in particular. These predictions were only partially confirmed as we did find a substantial number of cholinergic genes whose level significantly differed between the control and AD states. In the hypothalamus, we identified three and eight genes whose levels significantly changed in females and males, respectively (FigureS3). These changes were even more pronounced in the STG, where the levels of 22 and 18 cholinergic genes changed significantly in females and males, respectively (Figure S4). However, consistent with our prediction, there was no significant elevation of cholinergic mRNAs (hypothalamus: females: 1/3, p <0.88; males: 5/8, p <0.37); STG: females: 14/22, p <0.14, males: 10/18, p <0.41). 3.6 Altered levels of STG cholinergic transcripts can be explained by changes in distinct cell populations The altered levels of cholinergic sncRNAs and mRNAs found in the NAc of AD cases, and AD females in particular, are attributed to cholinergic neurons in the Nac.17 However, this would not explain the altered levels of cholinergic mRNAs found in the hypothalamus and STG, since these regions lack cholinergic neurons.63 Nevertheless, previous studies identified AD-related cholinergic changes in other cell populations, including oligodendrocytes,64 astrocytes,65 and microglia.14 Therefore, we performed studies to identify the cell types that contributed to the altered levels of cholinergic mRNAs seen in these extra NAc regions. Specifically, we used single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from the SEA-AD study (Methods), to determine cell type-specific changes in cortical neurons. To pursue the potential cell types where such changes could occur, we compared Medial Temporal Gyrus (MTG, which is located next to the STG in the brain, Figure4A) data from control and AD brains, as the changes were more pronounced in the STG than in the hypothalamus. The data included classification to 24 distinct cell populations (Figure 4B), of which 18 were of neuronal origin and 6 of non-neuronal origin (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, OPCs, microglia-PVM, endothelial and VLMC). Notably, the non-neuronal cells constituted only ∼20% (20.7% in females, 19.3% in males) of all the cells in the analysis. First, we tested whether the MTG scRNA-Seq results are comparable with the STG bulk RNA-Seq. Finding such a consistency is not a trivial result for two reasons. First, while these regions are adjacent, they are not identical and therefore mRNA levels could differ between the two regions. Second, scRNA-Seq measures mRNA levels in the soma, whereas bulk RNA-Seq measures mRNA levels throughout the region, which includes neurites and extensions of non-neuronal cells. We focused on genes that passed the expression threshold (Methods) from among the cholinergic genes associated with ACh production and cholinergic regulation (31 genes, TableS10), as previous studies reported unreliable detection of changes in genes with low expression levels in scRNA-Seq.66 To test for consistency, we represented the expression of each gene in healthy and AD states as a linear combination of the mean gene expression in each cell type and the relative weight of the number of cells in each population (Figure4C; dots, TableS11). A linear regression on the log fold changes of these transcript levels in the STG bulk RNA-Seq and in the linear combinations representing gene expression in the MTG exhibited a slope that is significantly positive for both females and males (slope= 0.42, 0.36; p < 8 × 10−4, 0.01 for females and males, respectively) (Figure4C; solid line, Methods), demonstrating that the two measurements are consistent with each other. With the scRNA-Seq measurements, we can go beyond the bulk RNA-Seq results and study the specific cellular changes associated with the disease. For each population of cells, we computed the change in the fraction of cells, a measure of specific cell death (or formation), and the change in the transcript level of cholinergic genes, quantified by the correlation between the vectors of expression in control compared to AD (Figure4D, Methods). In general, the correlation coefficients were relatively high across cell populations, suggesting that the expression levels within a single population were relatively mild. By contrast, there were significant changes in the fractions of cells, indicating vulnerability of specific cell populations within the AD brain. Interestingly, the observed changes were more prominent in males, a result that is consistent with the observation that the cortex is affected more severely in males compared to females in AD.67 Of particular interest is the observation of a general increase in the glial cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia-PVM) in AD females. The opposite trend was observed in males. Notably, while the amounts of glial cells decreased in AD males compared to controls, the decrease in the number of neurons was greater and led to an increase in the relative percentage of glia (Figure4D, TableS11). For a complete list of changes, see TablesS11–S13. 3.7 CholinotRFs exhibit sex-related elevations during cholinergic differentiation of human-originated neuroblastoma cells Our definition of CholinotRFs was based on sequence-based complementarity with cholinergic genes. To challenge their role in cholinergic regulation, we studied changes in small RNA-seq transcripts in human neuroblastoma cell lines from male and female origins (LA-N-2, LA-N-5) 2 days after exposure to neurokines that induce cholinergic differentiation43 (Figure 5A, Methods). We hypothesized that differentiation would lead to elevated levels of all cholinergic RNAs, including CholinotRFs, related to cholinergic production. Indeed, following 2 days of treatment we found substantial increases in the levels of CholinotRFs in male originated cell lines. Of 308 CholinotRFs passing the expression threshold, the levels of most increased (65%, 201/308, p <5 ×10−8; TableS14). This increase was specific to CholinotRFs, as no such increase was observed in non-cholinergic tRFs (39%, 279/710, Fisher’s exact test p < 1 × 10−15; Figure 5B). Surprisingly, we did not observe similar increases in female originated cell lines: the levels of only 38% (118/308) of CholinotRFs were elevated (compared with 35% of non-cholinergic tRFs, 247/710, Fisher’s exact test p < 0.29; Figure 5B; TableS15). Since a previous study reported that neuronal cholinergic differentiation is a slower process that matures around 4 days,43 we further examined tRF levels 4 days after exposure to neurokines. At this time point, CholinotRF levels were elevated in the differentiated cells in both lines (LA-N-2: 77%, 209/273, p <1 ×10−10; LA-N-5: 64%, 174/273 p <3.5 ×10−5; TablesS16–S17). This increase was not found in non-cholinergic tRFs (LA-N-2: 47%, 335/706 non-cholinergic tRFs increased; LA-N-5: 33%, 234/706; Figure5B). The relative change was even larger in the female-originated cell line than in the male-originated cell line (p < 0.01). Thus, CholinotRFs were lost faster in the NAc of AD females compared to males NAc and were gained more profoundly in female-originated neuroblastoma cells compared to male neuroblastoma cells under cholinergic differentiation. Taken together, these results strengthen the link between the sequence-defined cholinotRFs and cholinergic regulation. Moreover, they support the finding of sex-related differences in the cholinergic regulation of AD via sncRNAs.",2993,16.pdf

Most importantly, TR-ZRA can enhance the ability of microglia to phagocytose Aβ and alleviate complement activation, which can promote neuronal activity and decrease inflammation level in the AD brain. Moreover, TR-ZRA is also loaded with Aβ aptamers, which allow rapid and low-cost monitoring of Aβ plaques in vitro.

Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is gradually becoming the leading cause of dementia worldwide, with the prevalence of AD gradually increasing from 5.0% in people aged 65–74 years to 33.2% in people aged 85 years and older, resulting in more than 52 million people being affected worldwide.[1] The pathogenesis of AD remains complex, but the most common explanation in recent studies is the amyloid cascade hypothesis. [2,3] The formation of Aβ plaques results from a series of amyloid peptides that are abnormally sheared. Excessive Aβ plaque accumulation could disrupt brain microvascular endothelial cells, impair the integrity of the blood‒brain barrier, and induce infiltration of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells from outside the brain, resulting in disorders of the immune microenvironment in the brain.[4,5] Therefore, remodeling the immune microenvironment and eliminating the accumulation of abnormal Aβ in the brain is one of the most important strategies for the treatment of AD. Microglia are macrophages in the brain and spinal cord, and they represent the primary line of immune defense in the central nervous system, as they are mainly responsible for clearing damaged neurons, Aβ plaques, and infectious substances in the central nervous system. [6] However, aging microglia in the brains of AD patients may become dysfunctional and metabolically impaired, and their ability to clear Aβ is reduced, which results in the formation of a large number of Aβ plaques.[7,8] On the other hand, microglia in the AD brain show excessive activation and an uncontrolled state, and they can release many proinflammatory factors (such as tumor necrosis factor TNF-α, interleukin IL-1β, IL-6, etc.) and complement components, further causing immune inflammatory damage. [9,10] At the same time, the membrane attack complex formed by complement activation can directly damage neurons that are highly sensitive to complement or stimulate microglia to release more inflammatory factors, forming a positive feedback loop to further aggravate immune inflammatory damage to neurons. [11] In addition, proinflammatory mediators decrease the expression of receptors capable of binding to Aβ on the surface of microglia, which decreases Aβ phagocytosis by microglia and further promotes the production and deposition of Aβ.[12] Therefore, modulating the immune response and enhancing microglial phagocytosis to promote clearance of Aβ while inhibiting complement to reduce immune inflammatory damage and synergistically protect neurons in the brain is a possible strategy to improve AD pathology. In previous research, CD22 was found to be highly expressed in aging microglia. [13] It was proposed that silencing CD22 might enhance Aβ clearance by microglia. Thus, an effective gene vector loaded with CD22 shRNA (RNAi) was designed to test this hypothesis. In addition, an Aβ aptamer (AAP), which can detect Aβ in the brain in real time, was designed to specifically bind to Aβ and indicate the content of Aβ via a fluorescence signal based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer effect. However, the negative charge of the nucleic acid hinders its entry into the cellular cytoplasm. Moreover, these naked nucleic acid molecules are easily digested by intracellular nucleases.[14] At present, the vectors for gene therapy mainly include viral vectors such as lentivirus, adenovirus, and adeno-associated virus and nonviral vectors such as cationic liposomes, but due to their drawback of immunogenicity, oncogenicity, high costs, and a single function, they are difficult to translate to the clinic, and their applications are limited. Notably, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline porous materials with periodic lattice structures that are formed via the self-assembly of transition metal ions and organic ligands; these structures have high porosity and a large specific surface area and can adsorb plasmid DNA via noncovalent forces such as electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding while protecting it from chemical and/or enzymatic degradation.[15,16] Chlorogenic acid (CA) is a phenolic acid extracted from honeysuckle that can be used as an organic ligand for the structure of metal-organic framework (MOF) CA has antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and complement activation inhibitory effects. [17] Therefore, our research aimed to synthesize a Zn-CA MOF by combining zinc ions (Zn2+) with CA for the efficient loading of CD22shRNA and Aβ aptamer. However, nanoparticles can be easily recognized and cleared as exogenous substances by the reticuloendothelial phagocytic system in the body.[18] Red blood cells (RBCs), the most abundant blood cells without nuclei in mammals, are the main medium for oxygen delivery, and their cell membranes are easy to prepare.[19,20] Moreover, the self-recognition molecule CD47 on the surface of erythrocytes endows the encapsulated nanoparticles with a long circulating half-life and immune evasion function.[21,22] In addition, receptor-mediated transcytosis is currently one of the most effective ways to mediate crossing of the blood‒brain barrier by biomolecules. [23] Transferrin receptor (TfR), one of the most representative transcytosis receptors, was distributed widely in endothelial cells, plexus epithelial cells, neurons, and common glial cell in brain tissue. In this study, inspired by most reports, a TfR aptamer was designed as a TfR ligand. [24] After binding to TfR, the nanosystem entered the blood–brain barrier through transcytosis of brain endothelial cells, and was then taken up by microglia, neurons, and other cells containing TfRs.[25,26] Thus, the resulting erythrocyte-camouflaged nanoparticles were expected to protect the whole system from degradation, and the TfR aptamer, which was attached to the surface of the erythrocyte membrane by lipid insertion, was predicted to improve the ability of the system to reach the blood‒brain barrier, both of which could play essential roles in enhancing efficacy. Hence, in this study, we proposed the use of Zn2+ and CA to construct a metal-organic framework Zn-CA (ZC), which simultaneously transports CD22 shRNA (RNAi) and Aβ aptamer (AAP) to form a ZC/RNAi/AAP (ZRA) nanocore. Finally, the TfR aptamer-RBCm (TR) shell structure encapsulates ZRA to form a novel erythrocyte membrane-camouflaged nanodrug system: TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP (TR-ZRA). As shown in Figure 1a,b, TR-ZRA was camouflaged by an autologous erythrocyte membrane and targeted to penetrate the blood‒brain barrier under the action of TfR aptamer. After phagocytosis and decomposition by microglia, ZC acts as an inhibitor of complement activation, and AAP indicates Aβ levels in the brain via fluorescence intensity. CD22shRNA inhibits the expression of CD22 in microglia at the gene level and promotes the phagocytic clearance of Aβ by microglia, which further reduces immune inflammatory damage in the brain and improves neuronal activity. Thus, TR-ZRA was designed to improve the immune environment of AD and provide a possible strategy to cure AD.",1049,17.pdf

Results and Discussion 2.1. Preparation and Characterization of TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP The primary process of TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP included incubation of Zn2+ and CA to synthesize a metal−organic framework (with PEI, positive charge) and loading with RNAi and AAP (negative charge), which resulted in the formation of ZC/RNAi/AAP nanocores via charge adsorption. The TfR-A aptamer was inserted into erythrocyte membrane vesicles (RBCm) to form the T-R shell structure. Finally, TR was used to encapsulate the ZC/RNAi/AAP nanocore and form TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP by ultrasound (Figure 1a). Afterward, changes in the morphology, size, and zeta potential of these nanoparticles were measured. As shown in Figure 2a, ZC exhibited 3D and quadrate crystal particles while ZRA was closer to the dispersed spherical structure, which may be caused by the modification of PEI, APP, and RNAi on the surface of ZC. TR-ZRA was synthesized after ultrasonic treatment and filtration, and it can be seen that there was an erythrocyte membrane structure (≈8 nm) around ZRA. Moreover, the elemental mapping images of TR-ZRA showed the co-localization of Zn, the characteristic element of nanoparticles, in the elements (P and S) of RBCm, which also confirmed that ZRA was encapsulated by RBCm (Figure 2b). As shown in Figure 2c, the sizes of the ZC, ZRA, RBCm, and TR-ZRA particles measured by TEM were ≈37.5, 60.1, 84.0, and 93.3 nm, respectively. In addition, as shown in Figure 2d, the zeta potentials of ZC and ZC-PEI were −14.9 and 13.6 mV, respectively. After co-incubation with the cationic polymerizer polyethyleneimine (PEI), ZC carried a positive charge on its surface, with a larger size and improved dispersion (Figure S1, Supporting Information). These results showed that the PEI modification of ZC caused a slight influence on the size, morphology, and potential of ZC, which were attributed to the characteristic of PEI. [27] The dispersion of ZC was also improved because the positive charges repel each other, and this behavior can be employed to achieve binding of more nucleic acid molecules with negative charges to form ZRA.[28] The TR, ZRA, and TR-ZRA particles had values of −10.2, 3.05, and −4.0 mV, respectively (Figure 2d). It can be seen from the zeta potential changes of the particles that the plasmids and aptamers successfully combined with ZC, and TR was successfully attached to ZRA to synthesize TR-ZRA. In addition, a gel electrophoresis assay was adopted to evaluate the complexation ability of CD22shRNA and Aβ aptamer. As shown in Figure 2e, ZC-AAP formation was limited to the initial gum hole when each micromole of AAP could combine with 0.27 μg or more ZC (the ratio was ≈4:15). In the same way, there was no free AAP or CD22shRNA at the bottom of the gel when 1 μg CD22shRNA was carried by 8 μg ZC-AAP (with a surface-mass ratio of 8:1) (Figure 2f). These results confirmed that ZRA could be synthesized step by step with the above proportions for subsequent experiments. Moreover, as shown in the UV−vis spectrum (Figure S2, Supporting Information), TR-ZRA had absorption peaks at 280 and 405 nm, consistent with the characteristic absorption peaks of RNAi, AAP, and TR, respectively. SDS‒PAGE (Figure S3, Supporting Information) showed that TR-ZRA possessed a protein profile similar to that of the erythrocyte membrane. DSPE-PEG-TfR-A-FAM was employed to prove that the targeting molecule TfR-A could voluntarily insert into the surface of the erythrocyte membrane. As shown in Figure S4a, Supporting Information, green fluorescence was apparent on the surface of the erythrocyte membrane, which confirmed inlaying of the targeted probe TfR-A onto the surface of the erythrocyte membrane via lipid insertion. And in Figure S4b, Supporting Information, it was observed that most of the erythrocyte membrane with green fluorescence was co-located with RhB-nanoparticles. Therefore, the obtained nanoparticles might exhibit the characteristics of immune escape and a long circulation period, which would increase the chances of passage through the BBB. [29] 2.2. Biocompatibility of the Nanoparticles The biosafety of nanoparticles is vital for future applications. The cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was evaluated by a standard Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay. The nanoparticles were incubated with various types of cells, including mouse brain endothelioma cells (bEnd.3), HT22 cells, and BV-2 cells. After 24 h of incubation, all these cells retained >80% viability with different nanoparticles at concentrations from 0 to 125 μg mL−1 (Figure 3a–c). In addition, we incubated RBCs from mice with different concentrations of ZC and TR-ZC (0–250 μg mL−1) for 2 h at 37 °C to evaluate the safety of the nanoparticles in the blood circulation. As shown in Figure 3d, no significant hemolysis (less than 2%) was observed after incubation of ZC or TR-ZC with RBC suspension. In addition, when ZC was coated with RBC membrane, the degree of hemolysis was further reduced, indicating that the ZC nanoparticles had good biological safety, and the erythrocyte membrane provided a further guarantee of the function of the nanoparticles in the blood circulation. Nanodrugs safely reach the target site and avoid being degraded by the immune system, which is one of the challenges for the effective delivery of nanomedicines to the central nervous system. We incubated mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages with ZC, ZC, and TR-ZC. As shown in Figure 3e,f, we found that R-ZC and TR-ZC can evade phagocytosis by immune cells due to camouflaging by the erythrocyte membrane. It is possible that erythrocyte membrane proteins, such as CD47, mediated the long-term circulation of the nanoparticles in the experiment by interacting with phagocytic receptors to escape phagocytic cells.[30,31] Therefore, more nanoparticles had the opportunity to cross the BBB. In our system, CD22shRNA, aptamers, and RBCs were endogenous materials, and ZC was also safe, so TR-ZRA had little effect on nerve cells, highlighting the advantages of this system as a therapeutic agent for AD therapy. Therefore, the biocompatibility of these nanoparticles in vitro confirmed their suitability for additional in vitro and in vivo experiments. 2.3. Establishment of Blood‒Brain Barrier and Penetration of Nanoparticles In Vitro The blood‒brain barrier (BBB) contributes substantially to maintaining the stability of the internal environment around the brain tissue and preventing harmful substances from entering the brain tissue. The tight junctions established between endothelial cells limit the passage of many neurotherapeutic drugs across the BBB.[32] In addition, the size, lipid solubility, and other physical and chemical properties of a drug also limit its ability to cross the BBB. Therefore, we next explored whether these synthetic nanoparticles could cross the blood‒brain barrier, which was simulated with a Transwell model in vitro. bEnd.3 and astrocyte cells were seeded in the upper and lower chambers, and BV2 was seeded in the bottom wells to simulate the BBB (Figure 4a). After 12–24 h of inoculation, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to verify the construction of the BBB model in vitro. As shown in Figure 4b, bEnd.3 and astrocyte cells were labeled with Cy3 and FITC, respectively, and their confluence was 90% on both sides of the insert, which was considered to indicate successful BBB construction. How to allow medicines with therapeutic effects within the central nervous system to transfer across the blood‒brain barrier (BBB) remains a challenge. Cerebral microvascular endothelial cells are regarded as some of the most important parts of the blood‒brain barrier, and they limit the flow of soluble substances and cells from the blood into the brain. The abundant expression of TfRs on most nerve cells made it possible for nanomaterials to cross the blood–brain barrier (Figure S5, Supporting Information). With the help of TfR aptamer, a large number of nanoparticles could be selectively transported into the brain environment via nanoparticle-specific targeting mediated by the TfR on bEnd.3 cells. Therefore, RhB-labeled nanoparticles were incubated with bEnd.3 cells for 2 and 6 h, and the localization of nanoparticles in the cells was observed by CLSM. As shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information, the cellular uptake of TR-ZC was much greater than that of ZC and R-ZC, which also indicated that TfR-A could enhance targeted cellular uptake. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 4c, after 2 h of incubation the red fluorescence of RhB-nanoparticles mainly colocalized with the green fluorescence of endo/lysosomes as yellow spots in these groups. However, after incubation for 6 h, most of the red signals separated from the green signals in the TR-ZC group, indicating that the nanoparticles had escaped from lysosomes. In contrast, the signals in the ZC and R-ZC groups were still located in endosomes/lysosomes after 6 h of incubation. The overlap coefficient results were shown in Figure 4d. These results indicated that TfR aptamer-TfR-mediated trans endocytosis could be an effective drug-specific delivery pathway that facilitates endo/lysosome escape and makes it possible for more nanoparticles to cross the blood‒brain barrier and be taken by microglial cells. Therefore, after establishment of the BBB model, Cy5.5-labeled nanoparticles were added to the upper culture medium to test their penetration. Specifically, the fluorescence intensity of equal quantities of different nanoparticles in the lower medium reflects their ability to cross the blood‒brain barrier in vitro (Figure S7, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 4e, free ZC showed minimal intensity due to its lack of lipid solubility and poor BBB penetration. Upon coating with RBCm, however, the transport of ZC was slightly enhanced. Notably, the best BBB penetration efficacy was observed for TR-ZRA due to the surface TfR aptamer modification that facilitated cell transportation via binding with TfR on bEnd.3 cells. The penetration in TR-ZC was only slightly enhanced, which may be attributed to the short total observation time and the stationary superior culture medium in the in vitro blood–brain barrier model. Generally, these results suggested that TR-ZRA can escape from bEnd.3 cells and efficiently cross the blood‒brain barrier, enabling further endocytosis by BV2 cells and regulation of microglial dysfunction. 2.4. Anticomplement Activity of Nanoparticles and Aβ Detection by Aβ Aptamer The complement system is a double-edged sword that is neuroprotective but can also be neurotoxic, depending on its starting target and activation level.[33] It has been reported that the levels of C1q, C3, C4, and other complement components in the brains of rats with AD are higher, and these components largely colocalize with Aβ plaques in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and cortex, suggesting that these complement components may be related to neurodegeneration caused by neuroinflammation and synapse loss in the brain.[11] As designed, ZC not only can be used as a drug transport carrier but also has anticomplement activity. The chlorogenic acid of ZC bound to proteins through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding and played a role in inhibiting complement activity. [34] Fifty percent hemolytic inhibition through the classical pathway (CH50) was used to evaluate the anticomplement activities. Guinea pig serum (complement) was diluted to 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320 with PBS and added to the hemolysis system to evaluate titers. As shown in Figure 5a, the hemolysis rate was close to 100% when the dilution of complement was 1:10–1:20, and the system achieved complete hemolysis. Guinea pig serum diluted 1:20 was selected to ensure complete hemolysis and improve the sensitivity of the system. As shown in Figure 5b, in the anticomplement assays, compared with the 1:20 diluted guinea pig serum group and the positive control, the ZC, R-ZC, and TR-ZC groups all displayed much lower hemolysis capacities, with values of 3.25%, 3.42%, and 2.99%, respectively. These results demonstrated that these treatments all possessed strong anticomplement activity, and their complement inhibition rates were up to 96.4%, 96.6%, and 96.8%, respectively. This result signified that the red cell membrane coating on the surface of the ZC did not affect the anticomplement activities of the ZC. Moreover, the anticomplement characteristics of ZC were verified in mice with AD. After nanodrug treatment for a month, Western blot (WB) assay showed that the content of complement components (C3, C4b, C1q) in the brain tissue of TR-ZRA treated group was inhibited (Figure 5c and Figure S8, Supporting Information). Besides, as shown in Figure 5d,e and Figure S9a, Supporting Information, the red fluorescence representing the level of complement C1q around astrocytes (red fluorescence) was significantly reduced in the TR-ZRA group but not in the ZC and ZRA groups. In addition, compared with that in the AD group, the fluorescence intensity of C3 and C4 was decreased in the TR-ZRA group but the complement components of other experimental groups remained activated in the brain, which also reflected the inhibition of complement activity to a certain extent (Figure S9b, Supporting Information). Moreover, GFAP, the indicator of activated astrocytes, was also reduced, which indicated that the inflammation in brain was relieved to some extent (Figure S9c, Supporting Information). These results were slightly inconsistent with the in vitro results, which may be because TR-ZRA, which reached the brain more abundantly under the action of targeting factors, fully reduced complement activity. In short, these experimental results indicated that the chlorogenic acid in the nanoparticles can inhibit the overactivation of complement in the brain environment and protect the nervous system. Nucleic acid aptamers, which are oligonucleotides that have high affinities and specificities for their targets because of their similarities as receptors, have received much attention.[35] It is generally believed that these aptamers form secondary/tertiary structures that provide binding opportunities for their targets. [36] In our design, the aptamer was folded into a secondary hairpin structure. In the absence of Aβ1-42, fluorescence was quenched when the FAM group labeling the 3′ end was close to the BHQ group labeling the 5′ end. The aptamer could bind to Aβ1-42 when Aβ1-42 was present. FAM and BHQ then moved far away from each other, and the green fluorescence was restored (Figure 6a). As shown in Figure 6b, after optimizing the experimental conditions, the relationship between the fluorescence intensity of AAP and the concentration of Aβ1-42 was analyzed. The results showed that the fluorescence signal of AAP increased gradually with increasing Aβ1-42 concentration, which indicated that AAP can indicate the Aβ1-42 concentration in vitro under certain conditions (Figure S10a, Supporting Information). In addition, the same concentrations of Aβ1-42 and BSA were incubated with different concentrations of AAP (0–160 μg mL−1) for 2 h at 37 °C to explore the reactivity of AAP (Figure 6c). Meanwhile, as shown in the Figure S10b, Supporting Information, different Aβ aggregates (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-20) were respectively co-incubated with aptamers at 37 °C for 2 h. The fluorescence intensity detected in Aβ1-42 group was significantly higher than that in the other two groups, indicating that the designed fluorescence aptamers had strong specificity and could bind to the protein sequence of Aβ1-42 for fluorescence recovery. As shown in Figure S10c, Supporting Information, the fluorescence intensity of AAP was both stable in the TBE and 10% FBS, which showed that the fluorescence intensity changed little within 24 h. AAP could also be used to monitor Aβ plaques in brain slices in vitro. We incubated 10 μM AAP with brain sections for 2 h at 37 °C and then observed the localization of Aβ on the brain sections under a fluorescence microscope. As shown in Figure 6d, AAP could specifically bind to Aβ plaques in brain slices from APP/PS1 mice and emit specific green fluorescence. Besides, the fluorescence image of AAP in the mice brain of TR-ZRA group was observed directly, which showed a little obvious green signal compared with AD-PBS group (Figure S10d, Supporting Information). Thus, these results indicated that this assay possesses the advantages of being economical and convenient and provides a new approach for monitoring Aβ in brain tissue in vitro. 2.5. CD22 Downregulation in Microglia and Degradation of Inflammatory Factors After simulating the BBB transport of the nanoparticles, we designed mCherry−CD22shRNA to reduce CD22 expression in BV2 cell. We chose the commercial reagent Lipo8000 as the control. As can be seen from Figure 7a and Figure S11, Supporting Information, the transfection efficiency of TR-ZRA was more excellent in BV2 and the mean fluorescence intensity of the TR-ZRA group was ≈1.56 times that of the ZRA group, which may be due to the action of targeting factors and erythrocytes membrane. There was no significant difference in plasmid delivery in normal and aging microglia (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Next, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were employed to detect the expression of CD22 to determine the silencing efficacy of the nanoparticles. After treatment with Aβ1-42, the expression of CD22 in BV2 cells was elevated. Compared with other groups, TR-ZRA groups showed significant inhibition of CD22, indicating regulatory activity of delivered CD22shRNA. Among them, TR-ZRA combined with targeting factors and erythrocyte membrane achieved higher delivery efficiency and thus had the strongest inhibitory effect on mRNA (Figure 7b) and protein expression of CD22 in BV2 cells (Figure 7c,d). CD22 silencing by the nanoparticles was also demonstrated in mice. After 1 month of treatment, the brain tissue of mice was employed for WB and immunofluorescence assays. The WB results showed that the expression of CD22 in the AD-TR-ZRA group was significantly lower than that in the AD group, indicating that CD22shRNA loaded with ZC effectively inhibited gene expression (Figure 7e,f). In addition, as observed in the immunofluorescence assay, CD22 expression (green) was significantly downregulated in IBA1-labeled microglia (red) after TR-ZRA treatment (Figure 7g). These results all demonstrated the higher silencing efficiency of TR-ZRA, which can probably be attributed to TfR-A’s targetability and efficient transport of ZC. What’s more, the activity of HT22 cells incubating with TR-ZRA was investigated by Live/dead staining. As shown in Figure S13, Supporting Information, there was no significant difference in the fluorescence intensity of dead cells between the PBS and TR-ZRA groups. These results indicate that CD22 silencing does not affect neuronal activity. These results indicate that CD22 silencing could not affect neuronal activity. Moreover, Aβ1-42 can continuously stimulate microglial toxicity under the pathological condition of AD, resulting in the death of microglia and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, in the brain. These proinflammatory factors in turn trigger and exacerbate Aβ aggregation, forming a vicious cycle during the pathological process and ultimately exacerbating AD.[37,38] Therefore, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in BV2 cells were evaluated by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 8a,b, we proved that the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were obviously increased when BV2 cells were cocultured with Aβ1-42 or the commercial transfection reagent Lipo, which might be associated with the toxicity caused by Aβ1-42 or Lipo. The levels of these proinflammatory cytokines remained relatively high after ZC treatment alone, which might be due to the correlation between cellular uptake of the drug and the level of intracellular gene expression in aging BV2 cells. Nevertheless, the levels of these proinflammatory cytokines were decreased in the ZRA- and TR-ZRA-treated groups, which might be related to the CD22 level in BV2 cells. [39] In particular, decreased CD22 levels could facilitate microglial status and promote phagocytosis of Aβ, which would further reduce inflammation levels. In addition, an immunofluorescence assay was adopted to detect typical proinflammatory factors, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 (green), in the cortex and hippocampus (Figure 8c and Figure S14, Supporting Information). The results showed that the levels of these cytokines were significantly reduced, confirming the anti-inflammatory activity of the TR-ZRA nanosystem. Neuroinflammation is mediated not only by the activation of glial cells (such as microglia) and the production of cytokines, chemokines, and ROS but also by the complement system. Aβ activates the NF-κB pathway, leading to increased release of C3, which can bind to C3aR on neurons and microglia, activate microglia, and induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines.[40] C1q binding to Aβ and tau proteins in the AD brain can also cause complement activation, which leads to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD patients.[41,42] Thus, complement levels may decrease, and the associated neuroinflammation may also be relieved after TR-ZRA treatment. Hence, the inflammatory environment in the AD brain was alleviated after TR-ZRA treatment. 2.6. Aβ Degradation and Increased Neuronal Activity Microglia, a crucial line of immune defense in the central nervous system, play an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis in the brain. In the AD brain, activated microglia have an impaired ability to phagocytose Aβ, resulting in Aβ accumulation and further intensifying brain inflammation.[43,44] Therefore, Aβ degradation in BV-2 cells is crucial to improve the AD environment. To simulate the AD environment, BV2 cells were incubated with Aβ1-42 for 12 h to induce an inflammatory state. To investigate the effect of nanoparticles on the phagocytosis of Aβ by BV2 cells, FITC-Aβ1-42 was co-incubated with proinflammatory microglial cells in the absence or presence of different preparations, including ZC, ZRA, and TR-ZRA. After 6 h, colocalization of the FITC-Aβ1-42 oligomer with endo/lysosomes was observed by CLSM. Endo/lysosomes are the main organelles of Aβ degradation in microglia. As shown in Figure 9a and Figure S15, Supporting Information, FITC-Aβ1-42 oligomer and endo/lysosome were mostly colocalized as yellow spots in the TR-ZRA group, indicating that the phagocytosis of Aβ1-42 by BV2 cells was enhanced in the presence of CD22shRNA, while ZC alone did not significantly improve the phagocytosis effect, which was consistent with the hypothesis that the inhibition of CD22 in microglia promotes the elimination of Aβ by microglia. A consistent trend was observed in the brain tissue of AD mice. To observe the capture and degradation of Aβ by microglia in vivo, microglia and Aβ labeled with an anti-IBA1 antibody and anti-Aβ antibody, respectively, were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Compared with observations in WT mice, aggregation of the Aβ green fluorescence signal was obviously observed in AD mice suggesting microglial dysfunction of Aβ phagocytosis in AD mice (Figure 9b and Figure S16a, Supporting Information). In addition, in ZC- and ZRA-treated AD mice, a mass of Aβ plaques and activated microglia were both observed, indicating that these nanoparticles could not reach the brain efficiently enough to encourage microglia to phagocytose Aβ. However, in the TR-ZRA groups, only a few Aβ plaques were observed, and the area of activated microglia decreased in the brain (Figure S16b,c, Supporting Information). These phenomena suggested that after treatment with nanoparticles, the expression of CD22 in microglia was downregulated, which could enhance the dysfunction of healthy microglia, alleviate activated microglial infiltration and promote phagocytosis of Aβ in the brain tissue of AD mice. In conclusion, TR-ZRA, compared with the other treatments, significantly ameliorated Aβ clearance and microglial dysfunction in the brain tissue. It is generally considered that aggregated Aβ1-42 can lead to cytotoxicity.[45] It has been proven that TR-ZRA can downregulate CD22 in microglia, which could improve the ability of BV2 cells to phagocytose Aβ and reduce the toxicity of Aβ to neurons. We performed live/dead staining to investigate the effect of the nanoparticles on Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. BV2 cells were treated with Aβ1-42 in the absence or presence of nanoparticles. After 24–48 h, the culture medium of BV2 cells was removed and incubated with HT22 cells for 24 h to evaluate cell activity. As shown in Figure 9c and Figure S17, Supporting Information, there were a number of dead cells after incubation with Aβ1-42 alone for 24 h. In addition, free ZC or CD22shRNA had little effect due to their poor cellular uptake and Aβ clearance. Nevertheless, the number of dead cells decreased significantly after treatment with TR-ZRA medium, which means that the cells’ functions had been improved. This indicated that the TR-ZRA nanoparticles could reduce Aβ-induced cytotoxicity and promote cell proliferation. Similarly, both HE staining and Nissl staining showed improvements in neuron health after TR-ZRA treatment. As shown in Figure 9d, the nucleoli became clearer, the cells were arranged neatly, and the intracellular Nissl bodies were more abundant, indicating that the neurons were repaired effectively. 2.7. Biodistribution, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Improved Memory Capability In Vivo To evaluate the therapeutic effect of the nanoparticles in vivo, 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice were intravenously injected every 5 days for a month (Figure 10a). To observe the distribution of nanoparticles in vivo, we injected Cy5.5-labeled nanoparticles intravenously into mice. As expected, after intravenous administration, fluorescence images showed that TR-ZRA group showed a strong fluorescence signal in the brain tissue in vivo 72 h after injection (Figure 10b). Besides, we observed the circulation of RhB labeled nanoparticles in mice. As shown in the Figure S18, Supporting Information, free ZC was rapidly cleared from the mouse after injection through the tail vein with a brief half-life. In contrast, for R-ZC, a significant increase in half-life was observed. It should also be noted that the amount of nanoparticles in the TR-ZC group also showed a rapid decrease in the amount of circulating in vivo with the shorter half-life, but the amount in vivo was still relatively higher than that of free ZC. This result may be related to the loading of targeted factors on the nanoparticles after coating, which made most of the nanoparticles concentrate in the brain. This is mainly attributed to the TfR-A aptamer and erythrocyte membrane modification on the nanoparticles, which helped TR-ZRA target endothelial cells in the mouse brain and prolong the circulation in vivo, respectively. 72 h after injection, these mice were sacrificed by the cervical dislocation method. Their brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney tissues were collected for fluorescence imaging in vitro, and the results were consistent with the previous results. As shown in Figure 10c, the ZC and ZRA groups showed a small amount of aggregation in the brain, liver, and kidney, while the accumulation of TR-ZRA in the brain was significantly higher than that in the other groups. Compared to ZC and ZRA, TR-ZRA showed 2.0/1.24-fold-enhanced Cy5.5 signals respectively 72 h after injection, indicating a stronger ability to target and penetrate the BBB (Figure 10d). These results indicated that TR-ZRA had a great targeting effect to brain tissue in vivo. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can clearly display anatomical structures with high resolution, distinguish gray matter from white matter, and measure the area and volume of hippocampal structures in the brain, which means that MRI studies have been important for the clinical identification of AD. After a month of treatment, the brains of WT and AD mice were imaged by MRI. As shown in Figure 10e,f, a reduction in hippocampal region volume was observed in AD mice (17.985 mm3) relative to healthy WT mice (21.8 mm3), which was consistent with previous reports.[46,47] However, after TR-ZRA treatment for a month, there was a slight upward trend in hippocampal volume (18.29 mm3), which might also be related to the amount of drug reaching the brain and the duration of treatment. This demonstrated that therapeutic components, such as chlorogenic acid and RNAi, have the potential to protect neurons, alleviate neuroinflammation and remove more Aβ. On the other hand, the Morris water maze (MWM) experiment is an experiment in which mice are forced to swim and learn to find hidden platforms in the water. It is mainly used to test experimental animals’ learning and memory ability in the context of sensing spatial position and direction. Therefore, the MWM experiment was employed to compare the spatial learning and memory abilities of the mice after a month of treatment. As shown in Figure 10g, the typical swimming track route and the number of target platform passes in each group of mice were recorded. On the test day, the platform was removed, and AD mice treated with PBS had severe memory deficits and displayed no significant improvement after 5 days of spatial learning (Figure S19, Supporting Information). However, AD mice treated with TR-ZRA displayed substantially shorter escape latencies to target, with a 58.7% decrease compared with the PBS-treated group (Figure 10h). In addition, compared with the other groups, the TR-ZRA group crossed the platform more times (1.7 times) and spent more time (22.1%) in the target quadrant (Figure 10i,j). These behavioral experimental results indicate that TR-ZRA could alleviate memory impairment in AD mice to a certain extent. Moreover, when all treatments were finished, the major organs of the mice were analyzed by HE staining (Figure S20, Supporting Information). The nanoparticles did not cause any pathologic changes in the major organs in these mice, indicating clear biocompatibility in vivo after 4 weeks of treatment via intravenous injection.",4646,17.pdf

Here, we design a dual-targeted Prussian blue nanoformulation (PTCN) that can cross the blood-brain barrier and target amyloid beta aggregates further exert antioxidant effects. An adjustable gradient dosing strategy with PTCN is used for the ﬁrst time to design the preventive and therapeutic trials based on the severity of oxidative stress at different AD stages. The results show that PTCN could effectively ameliorate AD-related pathological processes, improve the cognitive decline, and rescue hippocampal atrophy of APP/PS1 mice in both preventive and therapeutic trials.

52,A dual-targeted multifunctional nanoformulation for potential prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100160,introduction,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive decline. However, most clinical drugs end in failure in AD treatment. Oxidative stress (OS), which refers mainly to oxidative damage induced by excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays as i g n iﬁcant role in AD.1,2 The brain is highly susceptible to oxidative attacks,3,4 and the body’s own antioxidant system normally defends against oxidative attacks to ensure low ROS levels. Under pathological conditions, endogenous antioxidants are extremely vulnerable to damage and interfer-ence, which weakens antioxidant functions in the brain. The produced ROS accumulate continuously and cannot be effectively eliminated before result-ing in irreversible OS, which interacts with other pathogenic mechanisms during AD and eventually leads to cognitive impairments.5– 7 Therefore, devel-opment of exogenous antioxidants that can combat OS is very important for AD treatment. Many developed exogenous molecular antioxidants exhibit poor perfor-mance in cognitive function improvement for several potential reasons.8,9 Firstly, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) blocks access to the brain.10,11 Secondly, some antioxidants that entered the brain diffuse and cannot effectively concentrate in the pathological areas of AD, resulting in insufﬁcient working concentration.12 Nanoantioxidants can target lesions through surface modi-ﬁcation and have been developed to treat diseases associated with OS, including AD.13,14 Notably, Prussian blue (PB)-associated nanoparticles (NPs) have been reported to be effective in removing ROS,15,16 which have been generally considered to be biosafe because the major component, PB, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).17 In addition, due to the simple preparation process and good reproducibility, PB NPs have considerable potential as exogenous antioxidants for use in AD treatment. Designing a ﬂexible and adjustable treatment program based on the occurrence and development of AD remains a major challenge. Clinical AD is usually divided into three stages (early stage, mild; middle stage, moderate; and late stage, severe).18 Currently, most research focuses on the middle and late stages of AD, lacking intervention strategies for the early stage or even the whole disease process. OS has been proposed to be one of the causes of AD and worsens with disease progression,19– 21 while other pathological molecules have also been found to exhibit different changes in different stages.22– 24 Therefore, ﬂexible and adjustable antioxidant treatment based on the different degrees of OS in different AD stages would help alleviate other pathologies and enable personalized treatment of AD. Herein, a dual-targeted PB@PEG-TF/CR NPs (PTCN) was assembled from traditional biomaterials and administrated using an antioxidation-guided adjustable dosing strategy for potential prevention and therapy of AD. The PB NPs in PTCN can exert antioxidant effects to scavenge ROS, and surface modiﬁcation with transferrin (TF) and Congo red (CR) enables to traverse the BBB and target amyloid beta (Ab) aggregates, respectively.25– 27 The designed antioxidation-guided adjustable dosing strategy with PTCN can effectively attenuate OS in the hippocampus, thereby ameliorating other path-ological processes and ultimately improving the cognitive functions and rescuing hippocampal atrophy for both preventive and therapeutic trials of APP/PS1 mice. Altogether, this work reveals the potential of PTCN to be developed as a promising drug and healthcare product for clinical personal-ized treatment of AD, realizing the early prevention, mild remission, and late treatment of AD.",527,18.pdf
53,A dual-targeted multifunctional nanoformulation for potential prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100160,result,"Synthesis and characterization of PTCN PTCN was synthesized by simultaneous surface modiﬁcation of carboxyl-ated PEGylated PB NPs (PB@PEG NPs) with TF and CR (Figure S1). Trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that PTCN exhibited a clear spherical shape and good uniformity (Figure 1A). The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of PTCN (198± 18.27 nm,/C015.97 ± 0.28 mV) (Figure S2) were larger than those of PB@PEG NPs (88.79± 4.50 nm, /C035.83± 0.23 mV) (Figure S3). Moreover, PTCN exhibited a TF characteristic peak at 270 nm and CR characteristic peaks at both 350 and 500 nm in UV-vis-NIR spectra (Figure 1B). These results indicated that PB@PEG NPs were successfully modiﬁed with TF and CR. Notably, the hydrodynamic diameter of PTCN showed no signiﬁcant changes for 14 days, indicating its excellent stability for further application (Figure S4). Next, we veriﬁed two important functions of PTCN, including crossing of the BBB and targeting of Ab aggregates in the brain. TF modiﬁcation has been widely demonstrated to help NPs cross the BBB via TF receptor-medi-ated endocytosis.26 To demonstrate TF-mediated BBB crossing function of PTCN, a compact monolayer of mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) was implanted into transwellﬁlters. Transendothelial electrical resistance values during the experiments were all above 180U$cm2, indicating the membrane integrity (Figure 1C ) .A f t e r1 2hi n c u b a t i o no fN P s ,7 . 2 %o f PTCN penetrated through the bEnd.3 monolayers, which was obviously higher than 0.8% of PB@PEG NPs (Figure 1D). After excess free TF was pre-incubated to block TF receptor-mediated endocytosis, the penetration ef-ﬁciency of PTCN was reduced to 3.5%, indicating that TF receptor-mediated endocytosis played a key role in the penetration process of PTCN. Then, on the basis of removing the endogenous Fe content in the untreated control group, the efﬁciency of PTCN entering the brain was evaluated by quantitative analysis of the increased Fe content in the brain. The results showed that the brain utilization of PTCN was approximately 5.9% at 3 h post-injection, reached the peak at 12 h post-injection,and retained 24 h after injection, while that of NPs without TF modiﬁcation was almost zero (Figure 1E). In addition to brain utilization, the mass fraction of Fe in the brain was calculated; the re-sults showed that PTCN increased the brain average Fe content by 90% 3 h after injection, which was signiﬁcantly higher than the control group (Fig-ure 1E). Furthermore, the presence of PTCN in hippocampal tissues of APP/PS1 mice at 3 h post-injection was further conﬁrmed by biological TEM. Unmodiﬁed PB@PEG NPs were found in blood vessels but not in the hippocampus, demonstrating that PB@PEG NPs without TF modiﬁcation cannot pass through the BBB into the brain (Figure S5). As expected, PTCN was observed not only in blood vessels but also in the hippocampus. In particular, we not only observed the presence of PTCN on the luminal side of endothelial cells but also the efﬂux of PTCN on the ablumenal side of the BBB, intuitively showing that PTCN can penetrate to the hippocampus from the blood vessels. These results strongly demonstrate that TF-modiﬁed PTCN can effectively cross the BBB, enter the brain, and enrich in the hippocampus of mice. What’s more, it has been reported that CR can be speciﬁcally bound to Ab aggregates by unique hydrogen bonds and that the resulting CR-Ab complex greatly enhances the redﬂuorescence of CR,27 which is typically weak. To verify this speciﬁcb i n d i n go fP T C Nw i t hAb aggregates, theﬂuorescence in-tensities of PTCN and CR combined with Ab aggregates were measured and compared with those of free CR and Ab aggregates alone. After binding with Ab aggregates, both PTCN and CR showed signiﬁcantly heightenedﬂuores-cence intensities, and theﬂuorescence intensity of PTCN combined with 100 mMA b aggregates was approximately 1.5 times stronger than that of PTCN alone (Figure S6). Under an invertedﬂuorescence microscope, only these complexes were clearly observed and had greatly enhanced redﬂuo-rescence (Figure S7). Furthermore, thein vitro ﬂuorescence of the PTCN-Ab complex was also evaluated by anin vivoimaging system. Theﬂuores-cence enhancement of the PTCN-Ab complex was not signiﬁcantly less than that of the CR-Ab complex (Figures 1Fa n d1 G ) .T h e nin vivo ﬂuores-cence imaging was performed on APP/PS1 mice with high levels of Abag-gregates in the brain, and demonstrated that only PTCN-treated APP/PS1 mice showed strongﬂuorescence signals in the brain region, but not in other organs (Figures 1H and 1I), indicating thatﬂuorescence was only visible when the CR on PTCN bound to Ab in the brain. All these results conﬁrm that PTCN can pass through the BBB and speciﬁcally combine with Ab aggregates. ROS-scavenging ability of PTCN The ROS-scavenging ability of PTCN is essential for its effective antioxi-dant activity in the treatment of AD. Therefore, we investigated the ability of PTCN to act like multiple enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD), as well as its hydroxyl radical scavenging (HRS) activity.25,28 These types of activity are key to removal of ROS. First, SOD-like activity was evaluated via assessment of O2$– scav-enging. Excessive O2$– was generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and detected by formazan formation using a WST-8 assay kit. The O2$– inhibition rate gradually increased with PTCN concentration (Figure 1J), indicating good SOD-like activity of PTCN. Second, since O2$– can be dismu-tated spontaneously or catalyzed by SOD to form H2O2, which is another important ROS, H2O2 scavenging was used to evaluate CAT-like activity and POD-like activity. CAT-like activity was investigated via assessment of H2O2 decomposition to produce O2. After PTCN was added into 30% H2O2 solution, the amount of bubbles increased with PTCN concentration, while PTCN alone did not exhibit bubbles (Figure S8). Quantitative analysis of dis-solved oxygen showed that PTCN catalyzed production of O2 from H2O2 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Figure 1K). Furthermore, POD-like activity was investigated by catalyzing the reaction of H2O2 with the nat-ural substrate 3,5,30,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). PTCN treatment resulted in the characteristic absorbance of the products of H2O2-mediated TMB oxidation at 650 nm, and the effect increased with the PTCN concentration (Figure 1I). These results conﬁrmed the good CAT-like activity and POD-like activity of PTCN. Finally, HRS activity was evaluated via assessment of scav-enging of$OH, which is considered to be an initiator of lipid peroxidation. A TiO2/UV system was chosen to generate$OH, which was trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and detected by electron spin resonance. The signal intensity of DMPO/$OH was progressively reduced with increasing PTCN concentrations, suggesting adirect scavenging effect of PTCN on$OH (Figure S9). These results reveal that all the enzyme-like activities of PTCN exhibit concentration dependence and that PTCN is an effective antioxidant with ROS-scavenging activity. It is generally believed that iron-based NPs can react with H2O2 to cause Fenton reaction and produce$O H ,t h u sm e d i a t i n gb i o t o x i c i t y .29 Therefore, the assessment of whether PTCN can undergo Fenton reaction was crucial for the correct evaluation of ROS-scavenging activity and the potential biosafety of PTCN. As shown in Figure S10,t h eF e S O4 and H2O2 system has been considered a classic Fenton reaction model, and the produced$OH could speciﬁcally react with salicylic acid to form 2,3-dihydrox-ybenzoic acid, exhibiting an obvious UV absorption peak at 510 nm.30 How-ever, there was no absorption peak at 510 nm representing$OH generation observed after replacing FeSO4 with PTCN. Our results demonstrated that PTCN had no Fenton-like activity, which was similar to previous studies.25,31 Furthermore, considering that the chemical stability of PTCN in acidic solu-tions was not negligible for the efﬁciency of antioxidant activity and TF-medi-ated BBB crossing, we further assessed the possible iron release from PTCN as well as the detachment of targeting groups in the lysosomal mimicﬂuid. Acetate buffer, pH 3.6, was used to mimic lysosomal-like acidic condition, and PTCN was incubated with this buffer for 48 h, and then the suspension was centrifuged to obtain precipitate and supernatant. After replacing FeSO4 in the Fenton reaction model with the supernatant and precipitate of PTCN, no absorption peak at 510 nm was observed, and the characteristic absorp-tion peak of PB at 700 nm was still observed in the precipitation (Figure S10), demonstrating that the structure of PB as the core component of PTCN was not affected and that no iron was released from the PTCN in the lysosomal mimic ﬂuid. In addition, the characteristic peaks of TF, CR, and PB were still retained in the precipitate, but not found in the supernatant (Figure S11), indi-cating that targeting groups were not detached from PTCN in the lysosomal mimic ﬂuid. Antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of PTCN in PC12 cells To test whether ROS scavenging by PTCN could provide neuroprotection, we evaluated the effect of PTCN on the viability of PC12 cells under H2O2 oxidative shock.32 Cytotoxicity tests wereﬁr s tc a r r i e do u to nP T C N .A m o n g the components of PTCN, PB and TF have been approved by the FDA, and CR shows very low cytotoxicity (Figure S12). Cell viability after treatment with PTCN, at all studied concentrations, exceeded 80%, indicating PTCN’sl o w cytotoxicity (Figure S13). Then, H2O2 was used for oxidative shock to construct a cell model of OS. Oxidative shock signiﬁcantly reduced cell viability, with greater effects at higher H2O2 concentrations (Figure 2A). To assess the therapeutic effects of PTCN on cells under oxidative shock, cells were ﬁrst treated with H2O2 and then with PTCN. Cell viability was obviously lower in H2O2-treated cells than in untreated control cells, and the reduction was exacerbated with increasing H2O2 concentrations (Figure 2B). PTCN posttreatment greatly rescued the cell viability, resulting in even higher viability in the posttreatment group than in the control group (Figure 2B), which may have been attributable to the oxygen produced through H2O2 decomposition. To assess the preventive effects of PTCN on oxidative shock in cells, cells were treated with PTCN and then with H2O2. PTCN pretreatment also greatly enhanced cell viability, as the viability was greater in pretreated cells subjected to oxidative shock than in the cells subjected to oxidative shock alone, and the effect increased with increasing PTCN concentration (Figure 2C). These results indicate that PTCN posttreatment and pretreat-ment can effectively rescue cells and prevent the cell death caused by H2O2 oxidative shock, respectively. Then, the effects of PTCN posttreatment and pretreatment on cellular ROS levels and apoptosis under H2O2 oxidative shock were further studied. DCFH-DA staining was performed to measure cellular ROS levels. Unlike the control treatment and PTCN alone, H2O2 treatment caused excess ROS production in cells and resulted in shrunken cellsand decreased numbers of synapses (Figures 2D and 2E). PTCN posttreatment and pretreatment restored the morphology of cells and synapses, while reducing the elevations in ROS levels caused by H2O2 oxidative shock (Figures 2Da n dS14). These results were further demonstrated byﬂow cytometric quantitativeﬂuorescence anal-ysis (Figures 2Ea n dS15). Dual staining with Calcein-AM and propidium io-dide was performed to mark live and dead cells. The results showed that cells were destroyed after H2O2 oxidative shock, while PTCN posttreatment and pretreatment prevented the cells from being damaged (Figure S16). More-over, ﬂow cytometric quantitative apoptosis analysis demonstrated that PTCN posttreatment signiﬁcantly improved the survival rate from 54.6% (un-der H2O2 oxidative shock) to 83.4%; similarly, PTCN pretreatment increased the survival rate to 84.6% (Figure 2F). These results suggest that PTCN pro-vides excellent neuroprotection against oxidative shock for both preventive and therapeutic treatments. Behavioral and hippocampal volume assessment for evaluation of the efﬁcacy of PTCN for AD prevention and therapyin vivo Beforein vivotreatments, the biosafety of PTCN was demonstrated by he-matoxylin and eosin staining (Figure S17) and routine blood analysis (Table S1). Next, we quantitatively analyzed Fe content in the blood of APP/PS1 mice after intravenous injection of PTCN using ICP-MS. As shown inFig-ure S18, we observed high blood Fe content at 0.5 h post-injection and a decrease of only 33% at 48 h post-injection, suggesting that PTCN composed mainly of Fe might have longer blood circulation. On the basis of the brain uti-lization and blood Fe content of PTCN, we designed a gradient dosing strat-egy for the preventive and therapeutic trials with APP/PS1 mice according to the severity of OS in different AD stages (Figures 3Aa n dS19). For the preven-tive trial, APP/PS1 mice at the age of 10 weeks were treated with a low dose of PTCN until 16 weeks and then with a medium dose until 22 weeks, while, for the therapeutic trial, APP/PPS1 mice at the age of 25 weeks were treated with a high dose until 31 weeks. Cognitive behaviors were assessed with a Morris water maze (MWM) test (Figures 3B and 3F). To exclude the possible difference in sensorimotor func-tions between each group, the swimming speed of each group wasﬁrst calculated and no signiﬁcant difference was found among the three groups in both preventive and therapeutic trials (Figure S20). In both the preventive and therapeutic trials, the escape latency of PTCN-treated APP/PS1 mice was signiﬁcantly shorter than that of untreated APP/PS1 mice (Figures 3C and 3G). Remarkably, both PTCN-treated APP/PS1 mice and wild-type (WT) mice showed a preference for the target quadrant, while untreated APP/PS1 mice rarely swam across it (Figures 3D and 3H). Similarly, PTCN treatment signiﬁcantly increased the number of crossings of APP/PS1 mice over the platform in both the preventive and therapeutic trials (Figures 3E and 3I). Then, we evaluated hippocampal volume changes by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since hippocampal atrophy is a recognized biolog-ical marker of AD.33– 35 In both the preventive and therapeutic trials, there were no differences in hippocampal volumes between PTCN-treated APP/ PS1 mice and WT mice, while the volumes in untreated APP/PS1 mice were much smaller than those in WT mice (Figures 3J, 3K, andS21). Overall, these results suggest that, as AD progresses, cognitive impairment gradually worsens, and the impairment is accompanied by pronounced hippocampal atrophy; however, PTCN treatment through an adjustable gradient dosing strategy in the early and late stages of AD can effectively ameliorate cognitive impairments and hippocampal atrophy. Ascertainment of the pathological mechanisms targeted by PTCN antioxidant treatment To further explore the pathological mechanisms targeted by PTCN antiox-idant treatment, pathological changes in the mouse hippocampus were detected monthly during both preventive (Figure 4A) and therapeutic trials (Figure 5A) by western blot analysis. First, lipid peroxidation and DNA oxida-tive damage represented by 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxyguano-sine (8-OHG), respectively, were analyzed to evaluate the alleviation of OS by PTCN. The 4-HNE assay results showed that 4-HNE appeared at 10 weeks in APP/PS1 mice and that the levels gradually increased (Figure 4A); however, the levels were slightly reduced after PTCN treatment in the preventive trial (Figure 4B). Notably, the levels of 4-HNE were higher in the older APP/PS1 mice than in the younger mice (Figure 5A) and were signiﬁcantly reduced by PTCN treatment in the therapeutic trial (Figure 5B). The 8-OHG results showed that, during the preventive trial, a difference in 8-OHG level between APP/PS1 mice and WT mice appeared at 10 weeks, but the difference was gradually eliminated by PTCN treatment (Figures 4A and 4B). During the ther-apeutic trial, the 8-OHG level in APP/PS1 mice was quite high and was also greatly reduced by PTCN treatment to reach the same level as that in WT mice (Figures 5A and 5B). These results indicated that lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidative damage occurred at the beginning of the AD process and were gradually aggravated. PTCN treatment more effectively alleviated DNA oxidative damage than lipid peroxidation in the early stage of AD, while it alleviated both in the late stage of AD. Next, we investigated other AD-related pathological changes that have been reported to interact with OS, including Ab aggregates,36 mitochon-drial dysfunction,37,38 inﬂammation,39 synaptic damage,40 and neuronal apoptosis.41 PTCN treatment slightly but nonsigniﬁcantly reduced Ab aggre-gates (Figures 4A, 4B,5A, and 5B) in APP/PS1 mice. Given the apparent im-provements in cognitive behavior and hippocampal volume, Ab is very likely not the primary cause of cognitive impairments in AD, which is consistent with the fact that most clinical drugs for Ab have failed. Obvious increases in dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) levels and decreases in mitofusin 2 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV levels were observed from 10 to 32 weeks in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction (Figures 4Aa n d5A). PTCN treatment regulated the levels of mitochondrial function markers to close to normal levels, except for DRP1 (Figures 4Ca n d5C). The continuous activation of astrocytes and microglia as well as the increased levels of inﬂammatory cytokines in APP/PS1 mice indicated severe inﬂammation(Figures 4Aa n d5A). Notably, PTCN treatment markedly inhibited microglial activation and reduced inﬂammatory cytokine levels in the preventive trial but only slightly inhibited microglial activation and reduced inﬂammatory cytokine levels in the therapeutic trial (Figures 4D, 4E, 5D and 5E). Marked synaptic damage represented by decreased levels of synapsin 1 and postsynaptic density protein 95 was observed in APP/PS1 mice (Figures 4Aa n d5A). As expected, continued deterioration was restrained by PTCN treatment in both the preventive and therapeutic trials (Figures 4Fa n d5F). Neuronal apoptosis was abnormal at 10 weeks in APP/PS1 mice, as characterized by increased levels of P53 and caspase-3 and decreased levels of BCL-2 (Figures 4Aa n d5A). In the preventive trial, P53 and caspase-3 levels were downregulated nonsigniﬁcantly, while BCL-2l e v e l sw e r es i g n iﬁcantly upregulated after PTCN treatment (Figure 4G). In the therapeutic trial, the upregulation of BCL-2 as well as downregulation of P53 and caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly observed after PTCN treatment (Fig-ure 5G). So the mechanisms by which PTCN treatment attenuated neuronal death in the preventive trial and the therapeutic trial were considered to be different. Overall, PTCN counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction and synap-tic damage during the entire process of AD. In the early stage of AD, PTCN also signiﬁcantly inhibited inﬂammation and mildly inhibited neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, in the late stage of AD, PTCN weakly reduced inﬂam-mation but signiﬁcantly enhanced apoptosis inhibition. These results demonstrate that PTCN administration via a gradient dosing strategy can effectively and continuously attenuate oxidative damage throughout different AD stages, thus attenuating other AD-related pathological mecha-nisms to varying degrees. Theseﬁndings suggest that PTCN is a promising multitarget drug for both preventive and therapeutic treatments of AD.",3051,18.pdf
54,Diagnosis and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease Targeting the Amyloid Beta (Aβ,2025,https://doi.org/10.36838/v7i2.3,abstract,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health challenge, with its prevalence expected to rise dramatically in the coming years. The amyloid hypothesis suggests that amyloid beta (Aβ) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD, causing neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of AD, with emphasis on the role of Aβ. Diagnostic criteria for AD have evolved to include clinical biomarkers such as brain amyloid markers detected by positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Emerging research suggests that retinal hyperspectral imaging may be a promising non-invasive biomarker of brain Aβ status. While current therapeutic options for AD are primarily focused on symptomatic relief, there is growing interest in disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) aimed at modulating Aβ pathology to alter the disease trajectory. Aducanumab, the first FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy for AD, represents a significant breakthrough in this regard. Other monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ, such as Donanemab, Lecanemab, and Gantenerumab, are currently being studied in clinical trials. The integration of novel diagnostic approaches and disease-modifying therapies targeting Aβ pathology holds the promise of improving patient outcomes and reducing the societal burden of AD.",197,19.pdf
55,Diagnosis and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease Targeting the Amyloid Beta (Aβ,2025,https://doi.org/10.36838/v7i2.3,introduction,"Alzheimer’s disease (named after the German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a complex neurological disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. As of 2020, there are approximately 50 million AD patients worldwide, which is expected to double every 20 years to reach 152 million by 2050. AD also imposes a significant economic burden, with annual global costs estimated at 1 trillion USD. The multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s disease, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, complicates its prevention and diagnosis. Regarding the currently unclear pathogenesis of AD, two hypotheses have been proposed: the cholinergic hypothesis and the amyloid hypothesis.1 The ‘amyloid hypothesis’ states that amyloid beta (Aβ), a polypeptide derived from incorrect proteolytic cleavage in the brain, plays an important role in the origin and progression of the neurodegenerative disease. Pathologically, AD is associated with Aβ deposition, subsequent formation of amyloid plaques outside neurons, and the intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Both abnormalities have been observed to induce neuronal apoptosis and ultimately lead to dementia,2,3 although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Aβ deposition is typically followed by synaptic dysfunction, tau protein abnormality in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain structural changes, and cognitive decline.3,4 The accumulation of Aβ is asymptomatic and begins in the early stages of AD. 2 Recognizing Aβ as a potential biomarker for AD, many studies have been conducted to distinguish AD from normal individuals and to predict the progression or onset of AD by monitoring Aβ. The use of biomarkers for early diagnosis in preclinical stages or mild cognitive impairment holds promise to prevent or delay the progression of AD.3,5 Current advances in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using Aβ-selective tracers have great utility in confirming the clinical diagnosis of the disease.6 Since there is a substantial delay between the onset of cognitive impairment and the diagnosis of AD typically,7,8 there is a strong need for practical, non-invasive, and cost-effective biomarkers to identify individuals at risk for AD.9 Current therapeutic options for AD are limited to medications that provide modest symptomatic improvement. As the amyloid beta(Aβ) is central to pathogenesis, Aβ-targeted immunotherapy has become a focus of attention as a putative disease-modifying treatment for AD.10 This review provides an overview of recent research findings on brain Aβ biomarkers and Aβ-directed immunotherapies in the context of AD diagnosis and treatment.

57,Mechanism of quercetin therapeutic targets for Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02248-5,abstract,"Quercetin has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic activities, suggesting therapeutic potential against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this study, potential molecular targets of quercetin were first identified using the Swiss Target Prediction platform and pathogenic targets of T2DM and AD were identified using online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM), DisGeNET, TTD, DrugBank, and GeneCards databases. The 95 targets shared among quercetin, T2DM, and AD were used to establish a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, top 25 core genes, and protein functional modules using MCODE. Metascape was then used for gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. A protein functional module with best score was obtained from the PPI network using CytoHubba, and 6 high-probability quercetin targets (AKT1, JUN, MAPK, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR) were confirmed by docking simulations. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out according to the molecular docking results. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the major shared mechanisms for T2DM and AD include “AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications,” “pathways in cancer,” and “MAPK signaling pathway” (the key pathway). We speculate that quercetin may have therapeutic applications in T2DM and AD by targeting MAPK signaling, providing a theoretical foundation for future clinical research.",206,20.pdf
58,Mechanism of quercetin therapeutic targets for Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02248-5,introduction,"According to the 2017 global burden of disease study, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are the sixth and tenth leading causes of premature death worldwide1, and many studies have found strong epidemiological, pathological, and clinical associations between T2DM and AD2. The incidence of AD is about twofold greater in T2DM patients than in non-diabetic individuals, while a disproportionate number of AD patients have a history of early or clinical diabetes. Diabetes and AD also share numerous common risk factors, including metabolic disease (obesity), cardiovascular disease, older age, and progressive insulin resistance2, as well as common pathogenic processes such as chronic hyperglycemia, tissue amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and toxicity, cellular oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. Indeed, the term “type 3 diabetes” has been proposed to describe AD based on the hypothesis that AD-associated dementia is caused in part by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin-like growth factor signaling in the brain3. It is believed that endocrine and metabolic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose due to insulin resistance and death of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β-cells can lead to chronic cardiovascular diseases and ultimately to AD. Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the accumulation of Aβ in the brain parenchyma (termed senile plaques, SPs) and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the intermediate filament protein tau within neurons, forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The presence of these inclusions results in synaptic loss, particularly in neocortex and hippocampus, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to neuronal dysfunction and death4. Tau protein and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) deposits are also found in the pancreatic islets of T2DM patients. Moreover, pharmacological studies have shown that some traditional hypoglycemic drugs can slow the progression of AD4. While there is strong evidence for an association between T2DM and AD at multiple levels, the seminal molecular mechanisms linking these disorders remain unknown. One potential strategy for identifying these molecular linkage pathways is to screen for common drug targets, which would also provide new possibilities for the treatment of T2DM and AD. Quercetin (3, 3′, 4′, 5, 7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a natural polyhydroxyflavonoid found in the flowers, leaves, and fruits of edible plants such as onion, apple, lettuce, and cabbage4. In addition, many Chinese herbal medicines such as Sophora japonica, Ginkgo biloba leaves, Hypericum perforatum, and cortex moutan are enriched in quercetin5. Numerous studies have documented bioactivities of quercetin relevant to T2DM and AD pathology, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic effects. Quercetin has also been shown to reduce blood glucose concentration and preserve islet function, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell numbers in diabetic model rats and mice6,7. At present, there is no broadly effective drug treatment to delay AD onset, slow progression, or improve outcome8, and the few approved mediations can only transiently improve symptoms9. Also, many synthetic drugs with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and (or) hypolipidemic activities induce adverse events that preclude clinical use. The use of natural substances to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and metabolic diseases such as T2DM is a promising alternative as such agents are often easily and inexpensively isolated and have well documented biomechanisms and safety profiles. Yao . conducted a cross-sectional study of nearly 20,000 people10. The results show that there is a significant negative correlation between dietary quercetin intake and the prevalence of T2DM in Chinese population, which suggests that dietary quercetin intake may play a positive role in the prevention and treatment of T2DM, such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, blood sugar and blood lipid. At the same time, it is supported by experiments7, Supplementation of quercetin can reduce the blood glucose concentration and promote islet in diabetic rats. β Cell recovery and increased insulin release. Quercetin has insulin sensitizing effect. Long term low-dose dietary supplementation can reduce insulin resistance (IR) 6 in diabetic mice. Quercetin and its glycosides have extensive neuroprotective effects against AD, and its mechanism mainly includes interference β-the formation and deposition of starch protein can inhibit the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein to intervene the disease development process of AD. It can play a protective role on nerve cells through anti-inflammatory response, antioxidant stress and inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, it also has estrogen like effect on nerve cells. In recent years, the estrogen like neuroprotective effect of quercetin has attracted more and more attention. Epidemiology found that the probability of ad in postmenopausal women is much higher than that in men, suggesting that estrogen reduction is a risk factor for AD, and estrogen replacement therapy may prevent and delay the occurrence of AD. Quercetin has also shown anti-dementia and neuroprotective efficacies in models of dementia/AD and ischemia–reperfusion injury by mitigating neuronal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and by improving calcium homeostasis, growth factor signaling, and neuroplasticity, ultimately preventing neuronal apoptosis11–15. Further, a number of large double-blind clinical studies have demonstrated that quercetin can reduce the composite end-point of death in patients with T2DM and AD. In the present study, we used a systematic bioinformatics approach (network pharmacology) and molecular docking simulations to identify quercetin-binding targets that may also be potential therapeutic targets for AD and T2DM.",837,20.pdf
59,Mechanism of quercetin therapeutic targets for Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02248-5,result,"Candidate quercetin targets for T2DM and AD treatment. After screening the literature and online databases, we identified 263 candidate gene products potentially targeted by quercetin. Screening for T2DM pathogenic targets retrieved 30 genes from OMIM, 175 from TTD, one from DisGeNET (with relevance score > 0.1), 266 from DrugBank, and 1108 from GeneCards (relevance score > 1). For AD, we retrieved 9 gene products from OMIM, 143 from TTD, 218 from DisGeNET, 67 from DrugBank, and 2712 from GeneCards. After removing duplicates, 1294 T2DM-related and 2865 AD-related genes were included in subsequent analyses. To obtain quercetin targets with relevance to T2DM and AD pathology and treatment, we constructed a Venn diagram, and a total of 95 overlapping targets were obtained (Fig. 2). PPI network of quercetin targets for T2DM and AD treatment. To estimate the contributions of these candidate common targets to disease and reveal the interactive effects, all 95 were imported into the STRING database with highest confidence set at 0.9 to obtain a PPI network. The PPI network results were saved in TSV text format and imported into Cytoscape3.6.0 for network topology analysis to identify the top 25 targets (arranged in descending order of relevance as a concentric circle in Fig. 3A). The PPI network (Fig. 3B) includes 273 edges among the 95 nodes (circles), where edge thickness represents the interaction strength. To further refine the list of quercetin targets relevant to T2DM and AD treatment, we conduct cluster analysis on the PPI network based on shared mechanisms using MCODE. This analysis yielded a function module of five key nodal proteins (Fig. 3C). It is generally believed that proteins in such functional modules are more closely related and may interact to perform specific biological functions. Therefore, these proteins may have important regulatory effects on T2DM and AD. Possible molecular targets of quercetin and associated regulatory signaling pathways relevant to T2DM and AD treatment. We further conducted GO functional analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis27–29 to elucidate the biological effects of quercetin targets and related signaling pathways relevant to T2DM and AD treatment. The top 10 GO items was selected based on p values (Fig. 4). Similarly, the top 20 KEGG pathway items were selected based on p values (Fig. 5A) and arranged according to category (Fig. 5B). The common targets were enriched in molecules with GO molecular function terms “cytokine receptor binding, ” “serine hydrolase activity, ” “oxidoreductase activity, ” “protein kinase binding, ” and “antioxidant activity, ” biological processes terms “positive regulation of cell apoptosis” (GO:0097190, GO:0010942, GO:0008285), “regulation of inflammatory response” (GO:0050727), “regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process” (GO:0072593), “cellular response to external stimulus” (GO:0071496), and “regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity” (GO:0071900), and cellular components terms “membrane raft, ” “external side of plasma membrane, ” “extracellular matrix, ” “vesicle lumen, ” “endoplasmic reticulum lumen, ” “cell body, ” “receptor, ” “perinuclear region of cytoplasm, ” “actin-based cell projection, ” and “apical part of cell. ” According to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, most of these common targets are involved in “MAPK signaling pathway, ” “TNF signaling pathway, ” “ AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, ” “pathways in cancer, ” “proteoglycans in cancer, ” “interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, ” “hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling pathway, ” “PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ” “EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, ” “Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, ” “NF-kappa B signaling pathway, ” “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ” “VEGF signaling pathway, ” and (or) “ Alzheimer’s disease. ” Thus, the common targets of quercetin, T2DM, and AD are strongly enriched in “MAPK signaling pathway” components as indicated by four of the MCODE nodes (Fig. 3C) and two of the top 10 GO molecular function items. In addition, most of the biological processes items are associated with MAPK activity, such as “kinase activity regulation, ” “cell proliferation, ” and “apoptosis, ” suggesting that the MAPK signaling pathway is the core quercetin target relevant to T2DM and AD treatment. Component-target-pathway network construction. A component-target-pathway network was constructed based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using Cytoscape3.6.0 (Fig. 6) in which the importance of a given node is indicated by the number of connections to other nodes. The average degree of importance (average number of connection to a given node) was 8.64, and there were 11 targets with degrees higher than 8.64: MAPK1 (degree = 18), AKT1 (degree = 15), PIK3R1 (degree = 14), IL6 (degree = 13), PRKCB (degree = 12), TNF (degree = 12), VEGFA (degree = 11), EGFR (degree = 11), CASP3 (degree = 10), BCL2 (degree = 9), and IL1B (degree = 9). Since MAPK1, AKT1, and EGFR were also included in the best scoring protein functional module, we speculate that these may be the key targets of quercetin for T2DM and AD treatment. Molecular docking results analysis. Finally, the interactions with core proteins in the PPI, MCODE, and component-target-pathway networks were verified by molecular docking simulations. The most likely and stable molecular interactions are generally those with lower energy after binding. Six core molecules were tested in docking simulations (Table 1 and Fig. 7), and all showed good binding affinity with an average free energy change of − 6.47 kcal/mol. For the quercetin–MAPK1 docking model, the small molecule ligand dapagliflozin potentially fit into the interface pocket formed by interacting amino acid residues in the protein. As shown in Fig. 7, a hydrogen bond was formed between quercetin and VAL302, HIS297, HIS139, and LYS205 near the active site of MAPK1. Molecular dynamics simulation results. After molecular docking, three proteins with good binding were selected according to the docking results, and the sander module in amber was used for 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation to analyze the stability of the system. The binding energy data of quercetin molecule and target protein were obtained by mm/GBSA calculation. After 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation, the structures of MAPK1 and TNF proteins are relatively stable, and JUN protein has certain structural changes. It is speculated that it is mainly due to the combination of JUN and DNA double strand in the original crystal structure to form a complex. This simulation only studies the combination of JUN and quercetin molecules, and deletes the DNA double strand, resulting in certain structural changes in the region where JUN binds to DNA. On the whole, the binding of quercetin to the three proteins was relatively stable, and remained at the predicted binding site of molecular docking in the process of molecular dynamics simulation. Only certain conformational changes were observed in TNF system. The binding energies of quercetin molecule and three target proteins were further calculated by mm/GBSA method. The results showed that the binding energy between quercetin and TNF was the strongest, in fact MAPK1, followed by JUN. below is the binding energy (Table 2) and molecular dynamics simulation diagram (Fig. 8).",1130,20.pdf
60,Multiomics Identification of Potential Targets for Alzheimer Disease and Antrocin as a Therapeutic Candidate,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13101555,abstract,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia and affects nearly 50 million people worldwide. Early stage diagnosis of AD is challenging, and there is presently no effective treatment for AD. The specific genetic alterations and pathological mechanisms of the development and progression of dementia remain poorly understood. Therefore, identifying essential genes and molecular pathways that are associated with this disease’s pathogenesis will help uncover potential treatments. In an attempt to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AD, we integrated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from six microarray datasets of AD patients and controls. We identified ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A (ATP6V1A), BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4), TOR signaling pathway regulator-like (TIPRL), and the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOMM70) as upregulated DEGs common to the five datasets. Our analyses revealed that these genes exhibited brain-specific gene co-expression clustering with OPA1, ITFG1, OXCT1, ATP2A2, MAPK1, CDK14, MAP2K4, YWHAB, PARK2, CMAS, HSPA12A, and RGS17. Taking the mean relative expression levels of this geneset in different brain regions into account, we found that the frontal cortex (BA9) exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher expression levels of these DEGs, while the hippocampus exhibited the lowest levels. These DEGs are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation processes, and various pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, our blood–brain barrier (BBB) predictions using the support vector machine (SVM) and LiCABEDS algorithm and molecular docking analysis suggested that antrocin is permeable to the BBB and exhibits robust ligand–receptor interactions with high binding affinities to CAMK4, TOMM70, and T1PRL. Our results also revealed good predictions for ADMET properties, drug-likeness, adherence to Lipinski’s rules, and no alerts for pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) Conclusions: These results suggest a new molecular signature for AD parthenogenesis and antrocin as a potential therapeutic agent.

61,Multiomics Identification of Potential Targets for Alzheimer Disease and Antrocin as a Therapeutic Candidate,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13101555,introduction,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is characterized by functional impairment, progressive cognitive dysfunction, and memory loss, is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia in aging populations, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide [1]. Worldwide prevalence rates range from 1.0% at 60 years of age to 30–50% by 85 years of age [2,3]. The etiology of AD is multifactorial and involves complex interactions between genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors; however, about 70% of the risk is believed to be genetic [4]. The pathology of AD is irreversible, and early stage diagnosis is paramount to halting the progression of the disease and avoiding deterioration [5,6]. Major clinical manifestations of AD and other dementias are mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD). However, the early detection of AD, SCD, MCI, and other dementias is still challenging [7,8]. The current diagnostic tools have several limitations and are unable to detect the disease in its early stages [9]. In addition, there is currently no effective treatment for AD, and presently available drugs do not modify the disease because they are unable to halt its progression [10]. The specific genetic alterations and pathological mechanisms of the development and progression of dementia remain poorly understood [11], and research in identifying more-important genes and molecular pathways associated with AD pathogenesis will help uncover potential treatments. Gene expression microarrays are widely used to comprehensively measure the genome-wide expression profiles of clinical samples, aiding in the identification of disease-related genes [12]. Previous studies have investigated gene expression changes in the brain tissues of patients with AD and other neurodegenerative dementias [13–18]. The public availability of the results from those studies offers the possibility of analyzing the transcriptomic data to identify potential drug targets and to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies. Natural products, particularly medicinal plants, represent the sources of the lead compounds for therapeutic development [19,20]. They are perceived as safer and offer fewer chances of drug resistance than most conventional therapies, which are limited by their undesirable side effects and drug resistance. Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) is a unique fungal species that is found exclusively in Taiwan and is traditionally used by indigenous herbalists to treat various diseases [21]. Among the many phytochemicals identified in AC, antrocin is a sesquiterpene lactone with established anti-neoplastic and immune-modulating functions [22]. Our previous data indicated that antrocin suppresses several biological signaling pathways, including the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/paxillin phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/c-Fos/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β/nuclear factor (NF)-κB, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT3), β-catenin/Notch1/Akt, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) [23–27]. In addition, the activation of apoptotic markers including Fas, DR5, Bax, caspase–3, –8, and –9 were also implicated in the pharmacological activities of antrocin; however, whether antrocin can modulate the gene alterations associated with AD remains unclear. We analyzed five AD microarray datasets and identified ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 as upregulated DEGs that are common in all five datasets (Figure 1). These genes covered a wide range of biological pathways related to brain function and disabilities. Furthermore, our in silico blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability and molecular docking analysis suggested that antrocin is permeable to the BBB and exhibited robust ligand–receptor interactions with high binding affinities to CAMK4, TOMM70, and T1PRL, suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic agent for AD.",557,21.pdf
62,Multiomics Identification of Potential Targets for Alzheimer Disease and Antrocin as a Therapeutic Candidate,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13101555,result,"3. Results 3.1. Deregulated Expressions of ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 Associated with the Pathology of Neurodegenerative Dementia The flow chart of the study design for the in silico identification of the potential targets for Alzheimer’s disease and antrocin as a therapeutic candidate is shown in Figure 1. To retrieve the genes whose expression levels were significantly altered in AD brains compared to non-AD brains, we analyzed the transcriptomic data of multiple cohorts from microarray datasets (Table 1). The DEG distributions for each dataset are shown in a volcano plot (Figure 2A). The overexpressed DEGs were identified from each of the datasets and were based on an adjusted p < 0.05 when comparing the AD patients and the control subjects from each dataset (Figure 2B−D). Furthermore, we integrated the overexpressed DEGs from each dataset to identify overlapping and the most implicated DEGs in AD pathology. Five significantly overexpressed DEGs were identified: ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A (ATP6V1A), BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4), TOR signaling pathway regulator-like (TIPRL), and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOMM70) (Figure 2C). 3.2. ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 Localization and Differential Expressions in Brain Regions To characterize the intracellular localization of the proteins, we acquired the indirect immunofluorescence data of distributions of the proteins within the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and microtubules of A-431 and A549 cells. We found that that ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 were colocalized with the markers of different subcellular localizations: ATP6V1A (cytosol and nucleoplasm), BNIP3 (cytosol), CAMK4 (nucleoplasm), TIPRL (vesicles and cytosol), and TOMM70 (mitochondria) (Figure 3A). In addition, we examined the expression levels of the DEGs in different regions of the brain. Taking the mean relative expression levels of these genes in different brain regions into account, we found that the frontal cortex (BA9) exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher DEG expression levels. In contrast, the hippocampus exhibited the lowest ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 expression levels compared to the other parts of the brain that were analyzed (Figure 3B, Table 2). 3.3. MicroRNA (miR) Regulatory Network and Brain-Specific Gene Interactions of ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 We conducted a tissue-specific gene co-expression analysis and found that each of the DEGs exhibited brain-specific gene co-expression clustering with 986 clustering nodes and 1212 clustering edges (Figure 4A). Specifically, we observed higher clustering co-expression with optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), integrin alpha FG-GAP repeat containing 1 (ITFG1), 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1), ATPase, Ca++ transporting, cardiac muscle, slow twitch 2 (ATP2A2), MAPK1, cyclin dependent kinase 14 (CDK14), MAP2K4, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein beta (YWHAB), parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PARK2), cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (CMAS), heat shock protein family A member 12A (HSPA12A), and regulator of G protein signaling 17 (RGS17). Furthermore, the PPI interaction network yielded 45 nodes and 435 edges, with an average local clustering coefficient of 0.813 and PPI enrichment p-value of <1.0 × 10−16. The PPI network revealed that TOMM70A and ATP6V1A exhibited very high protein family-specific clustering interactions while BNIP3, CAMK4, and TIPRL formed a very minimal cluster (Figure 4B). We queried the miRNA targets of the DEGs to gain further insight into their pathological role. We found that DEGs are targeted by several miR-regulatory networks (Figure 4C) that are significantly associated with the pathogenesis of several CNS diseases including Parkinson’s disease, Down syndrome, inflammation, cerebral infarction, and several other diseases (Figure 5). 3.4. ATP6V1A/BNIP3 and CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 Are Associated with Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Inflammatory Processes, and Various Pathways Involved in AD Pathogenesis To better understand the most common biological processes and pathways altered by dementia generation and progression, we analyzed disease associations, KEGG pathways, and the ontological enrichment of DEGs. Our results revealed the enrichment of fatty acid biosynthesis, ferroptosis, long-term potentiation, amphetamine addiction, adipocytokine signaling, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling, synaptic vesicle cycling, and peroxisome as major pathways associated with the DEGs (Figure 6A), while enriched molecular functions in the signatures were mainly associated with ATPase and calcium-dependent protein kinase activities (Figure 6B). In addition, biological processes, including the regulation of myeloid leukocyte differentiation, dendritic cell cytokine production, myeloid dendritic cell differentiation, cellular response to oxygen levels, and the mitochondrial protein catabolic process, were significantly enriched (Table 3). The gene–disease analysis further revealed that the ATP6V1A/BNIP3 and CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 signatures were associated with several brain-related disorders, including developmental disabilities, schizophrenia, intellectual disabilities, abnormal cerebral white matter morphology, and mental retardation (Figure 6C). Collectively, the findings from this study suggest that ATP6V1A/BNIP3 and CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory processes, and various pathways involved in AD pathogenesis. 3.5. In Silico Pharmacokinetics, BBB Permeability and Acute Toxicity of Antrocin The preclinical evaluation of drug PKs can aid in the drug development process by providing a rationale for the selection of efficacious drug doses and treatment schedules [52]. The BBB is an important factor that limits the effectiveness of most chemotherapies against AD. Herein, we evaluated the BBB permeation ability (Figure 7) of antrocin, and our results revealed a BBB permeability score of 0.038 (Figure 7, Table 4) on a BBB permeant threshold of 0.02, suggesting that antrocin is BBB permeant and thus would be valuable for AD treatment. Our results also revealed good predictions for ADMET properties, drug-likeness, adherence to Lipinski’s rules, no PAINS alerts, and that it is a non-inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (Table 5). QSAR modeling of acute toxicity in rats revealed that antrocin had LD50 values of 618, 26, 804.3, 517.3 g/kg body weight for the i.p., i.v., o.p, and s.c. administrative routes, respectively (Table 4), suggesting that the compound has a high safety profile, especially when administered orally. In addition, antrocin demonstrated high environmental safety, as measured by the bioaccumulation factor, Daphnia magna, fathead minnow, and Tetrahymena pyriformis. 3.6. Molecular Docking Profiles of Antrocin with ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 Our molecular docking analysis revealed that antrocin exhibited strong interactions with the crystal structures of CAMK4 (PDB:2W4O), BNIP3 (PDB:2J5D), TIPRL (PDB:5WOW), TOMM70 (PDB:3FP3), and ATP6V1A (PDB:6XBY) and demonstrated the respective binding affinities of −6.70, −5.80, −6.60, −6.80, and −5.90 kcal/mol. Our analysis of interactions between the target gene and antrocin revealed that antrocin interacted with the gene targets through several hydrogen bonds, π-alkyl, van der Waals forces (Table 6), and several hydrophobic contacts (Table 7). Antrocin bound to CAMK4 with three hydrogen bonds, including THR291, HIS156, and PRO220, with the respective binding distances of 2.72, 1.92, and 3.65 Å. In addition, the antrocin–CAMK4 complex was further stabilized by several van der Waals forces that were formed around the backbone of antrocin with the amino acid residues of MET224, GLU221, THR290, PHE292, and ALA153 in the binding cavity of CAMK4. However, only two hydrophobic contacts (PRO220A and HIS156A) existed between antrocin and the binding cavity of CAMK4 (Figure 8). Antrocin was bound with TIPRL with three hydrogen bonds, including THR208, SER173, and PHE254, with the respective binding distances of 2.03, 2.97, and 3.78 Å, with several π-alkyl, van der Waals forces, and various hydrophobic contacts (Figure 9). No conventional hydrogen bonds were observed between antrocin and BNIP3, while only a single hydrogen bond was observed between the ligand (antrocin) and the receptors: TOMM70 (SER271, 2.40 Å) and ATP6V1A (HIS96, 2.16 Å). In addition, several van der Waals forces and hydrophobic contacts were also observed between antrocin and the receptors: BNIP3, TOMM70, and ATP6V1A (Figure 10).",1226,21.pdf

64,Targeting the post-synaptic proteome has therapeutic potential for psychosis in Alzheimer Disease,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-04961-5,introduction,"Psychotic symptoms affect ~40 –60% of individuals with Alzheimer Disease (AD) 1. AD subjects with psychosis (AD + P) experience greater cognitive dysfunction early in disease progression prior to psychosis onset2,3 and more rapid cognitive decline compared to AD subjects without psychosis (AD-P)1–4. Current treatments for psychosis in AD with anti-psychotics have limited efﬁcacy, do not mitigate the more rapid cognitive decline, and confer excess mortality 5. In addition, AD + P is associated with worse outcomes than AD-P, including higher rates of aggression 6, caregiver distress 7, functional decline8, institutionalization9, and mortality 10. Thus, there is strong motivation to identify the biology underlying psychosis in AD in hopes of developing a targeted, more ef ﬁcacious intervention. The risk for psychosis in AD is to a large extent genetically determined, with an estimated heritability of 60%, indicative of a distinct biologic vulnerability4,11,12. Because it has long been recognized that synapse loss is the strongest neuropathologic correlate of cognitive decline in AD13,14, it has been hypothesized that the vulnerability to AD + P arises from greater synaptic impairment in AD+ P than AD-P. Prior studies that compared AD + P to AD-P subjects on a number of correlates of synapse integrity, including gray matter volumes, cerebral glucose utili-zation or blood ﬂow, or gray matter concentrations of the membrane breakdown products, glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine, have found support for this hypothesis across neocortical, but not medial temporal regions (reviewed in ref. 15). Most recently, we examined gray matter levels of a limited panel of 190 synaptic proteins in individuals with AD + P and found reductions in canonical postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins relative to AD-P subjects 16. These dif-ferences exceeded those which could be accounted for by any dif ferences in neuropathology burden between the groups16,o rb y reductions in the corresponding mRNA transcripts due to greater excitatory neuron loss in AD+ P17. None of these prior studies have directly examined the PSD in AD + P. We therefore conducted a proteomic analysis of PSD fractions from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of a large group of individuals with AD+ P and AD- P. To facilitate interpretation of differences between AD + P and AD-P we also included a reference group of cognitively normal elderly subjects. We found a global shift to reduced levels of PSD proteins in AD+ P subjects relative to both AD-P and cognitively normal subjects. There was a global shift towards lower levels in PSDs from AD+ P relative to AD-P subjects, including lower levels of a network of kinases, proteins regulating Rho GTPases, and proteins regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Using computational systems pharmacology we identi ﬁed several currently approved drugs predicted to reverse the PSD protein level differences between AD+ P and AD-P. Five days of exposure to one of these drugs, maraviroc, led to a net reversal of the PSD protein signature in adult mice, nominating it as a novel potential treatment for AD+ P.",486,22.pdf
65,Targeting the post-synaptic proteome has therapeutic potential for psychosis in Alzheimer Disease,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-04961-5,result,"PSD abundance in AD with and without psychosis. Prior to evaluating the full cohort, we validated our PSD enrichment in a subset of the AD cases (Fig. S1). To explore whether psychosis status globally affected the PSD yield in AD, weﬁrst evaluated the association of AD+ P with total gray matter yield of PSD protein (Fig. S2). Mean µg PSD/µg of gray matter protein was sig-niﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P relative to both AD-P and elderly cognitively normal subjects. The reduction in PSD yield in AD-P relative to elderly cognitively normal subjects was not signiﬁcant. PSD protein levels in AD with and without psychosis.W en e x t evaluated yield-adjusted PSD protein levels, conservatively limiting our initial analysis to the peptides present in 100% of subjects, comprising 1,613 proteins (Fig.1). There was a signiﬁcant shift in abundance of almost all proteins to lower levels in AD+ Pc o m -pared to AD-P (t=−90.6, df=1612, p <2×1 0−307). We con-ducted additional analyses to conﬁrm the robustness of this global shift. The global reduction was similarly present in the larger set of PSD proteins quantiﬁed using peptides present in≥50% of samples (Fig. S3a). Similarly, the global reduction of PSD protein levels persisted when covarying for excitatory neuron proportion, a measure we previously reported is reduced in AD+ P relative to AD-P17 (Fig. S3b, c). No individual protein level was signiﬁcantly reduced with an adjusted p < 0.05 (Supplementary Data 1). Thus, to characterize the nature of the broader signal of global reduction, we examined the 240 most reduced proteins (those with unadjustedp < 0.05). Functional annotation analysis of these 240 PSD proteins relative to a background of the 1,613 proteins that were quantiﬁed in 100% of subjects revealed strong enrichment for regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical determinant of post-synaptic dendritic spine structure and function (Supplementary Data 2). These included actin binding proteins and regulators of Rho GTPase signaling such as Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain containing Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) and Rho GTPase activating proteins (RhoGAPs). Additionally, there was enrichment for 23 protein serine/threonine kinases (Supplementary Data 2). These 23 kinases, which are important regulators of RhoGEFs, RhoGAPs, and actin binding proteins18, interact within a network that was itself enriched for the remaining 217 PSD proteins with nominally signiﬁcant reduc-tions in AD + P (Fig. 2). In addition to kinases, PH domain containing proteins, and actin binding proteins, the network included PDZ domain containing proteins and microtubule binding proteins, suggestive of disrupted signaling to additional post-synaptic structural elements (Fig. 2b). Choice of a more liberal threshold for peptide inclusion (e.g., present call≥50%) did not substantially alter the functional annotation ﬁndings, although now enrichment for histone proteins also emerged (Supplementary Data 3). Comparison of AD + P and AD-P with elderly cognitively normal subjects. While our focus was on the comparison of AD + P relative to AD-P, our dataset provided an opportunity to examine how the PSD is altered in these groups relative to our reference group of elderly cognitively normal subjects. Both AD groups were characterized by a signiﬁcant shift towards lower PSD protein levels compared to cognitively normal reference group, with greater reductions in AD + P than in AD-P (Figure S4a–c). As a result, 836/1613 (51.8%) proteins had an adjusted p < 0.05 in AD+ P in comparison to the reference group, whereas the corresponding number was 2/1613 (0.001%) proteins for the AD-P group (Supplementary Data 4). The pro-tein whose abundance was most altered between the AD and comparison subjects was APP, due solely to the increased levels of two peptides found within the Aβ sequence (RHDSGYEVHHQK and KLVFFAEDVGSNK, Supplementary Data 4 and noted as Aβ in Fig. S4c). Overall, the protein alterations present in the two AD groups relative to elderly cognitively normal subjects were highly correlated (Fig. S4c). As a consequence, both groups showed enrichment of differentially expressed proteins involved in pro-tein translation and of glycoproteins. Nevertheless, functional annotation of the proteins that differentiated AD+ P or AD-P from reference subjects revealed some differential patterns of enrichment. PSD proteins that differentiated AD+ P from elderly cognitively normal subjects included enrichment for proteins involved in calcium signaling, synaptic function, and cytoskeletal proteins. PSD proteins that differentiated AD-P from elderly cognitively normal subjects were enriched for proteins involved in protein quality control, ion channels, and small GTPases (Sup-plementary Data 5). We also undertook to contrast the PSD signature of AD±P relative to elderly cognitively normal subjects to the most extensive prior examination of the functional enrichment of proteins in total gray matter homogenates of individuals with AD and elderly controls subjects, reported in19. This contrast is summarized in Fig. S5. The differentially expressed proteins in the PSDs of both AD +P and AD-P shared with the overall gray matter homogenate enrichment for ribosomal proteins and glycoproteins. Other gray matter functional enrichments shared with either AD +P (Synapse, Mitochondria) or AD-P (Cell-ECM interactions, Ubi-quitination) may indicate that some of the overall signal detected in AD homogenate derives primarily from subgroups of individuals with or without psychosis. Finally, enrichments detected only in the PSD preparations (e.g. impacting Calcium signaling, ion transport, and the cytoskeleton) may reﬂect pathologic cascades that are most prominent within PSDs and not as readily detected in the multicellular, multicompartmental, gray matter homogenate. As such, these functions may represent postsynaptic-speciﬁc targets for intervention for cognitive impairment more generally. Relationship to genetic risk for AD with psychosis. We recently reported genome-wide gene-based tests of association with psy-chosis in AD11. A total of 239 of the 240 PSD proteins that were nominally signiﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P had available corre-sponding gene-based tests of association (Supplementary Data 6, and Supplemental Materials). Of these 239 genes whose proteins were assayed, 11 genes which were nominally altered at the protein level in AD+ P also exhibited at least nominal evidence of genetic association with AD+ P relative to AD-P. Notable among these were the actin binding protein genes SYNPO, SYNE1, ALDOA, and VPS16. Also included were the kinase PRKCI, and the GAPTBC1D10B. Predicted drug activity against the AD+ P PSD protein net-work. We next sought to identify existing pharmacotherapies with potential abilities to target the disrupted PSD signature of AD + P. We identiﬁed 50 gene knockout datasets in which the resulting changes to the transcriptome were correlated with the PSD protein signature of AD+ P (Supplementary Data 7). We identiﬁed 46 drugs targeting these genes, 7 of which showed the desired effect (inhibitor/antagonist or positive regulator) on the targeted gene (Table1). To further assess, computationally, the potential post-treatment effect of the nominated drugs on PSD protein levels in AD + P, two additional analyses were performed. First, the expression signatures due to knockdown of the upstream-genes were correlated with only the 240 PSD pro-teins nominally signiﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P to ensure that the correlation between the knockdown signature and AD+ P persisted when examining the most dysregulated proteins. This analysis identiﬁed thatMTOR had a correlation with the top 240 proteins that were opposite (negative) to its overall correlation with the 1613 proteins, excluding it, and its positive regulator, pimecrolimus, from further consideration. Second, we undertook to validate the gene signatures of the remaining candidate drugs. Of these, leronlimab, ibalizumab, and epigallocatechin gallate were not found in the LINCS database for evaluation of their induced transcriptome expression signatures, and procaine was not tested in CNS cells. Two of the remaining three medications, fostamatinib and maraviroc demonstrated transcriptome expression signatures that were negatively corre-lated with the AD+ P PSD protein signature (Signed Jaccard Indexes of −0.0025 and −0.0009, respectively, Supplementary Data 8). Effect of maraviroc on the PSD proteome. We looked to con-ﬁrm our prediction for one of the above drugs, maraviroc, by testing its effects on the PSD proteome in mice. We administered either 50 mg/kg maraviroc dissolved in a vehicle solution of 18% ethanol in normal saline or an equivalent volume of vehicle solution alone to three-month-old C57Bl/6 J WT mice for 5 days. We successfully quantiﬁed 1370 of the 1613 proteins that com-prised our PSD signature of AD+ P, including 201 of the 240 PSD proteins that were nominally signi ﬁcantly reduced in AD + P. Maraviroc treatment had a net effect of increasing PSD protein abundance, with a more marked effect in the subset of 201 proteins most disrupted in AD+ P (Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 9). The Signed Jaccard Index was−0.01186 for maraviroc’s effect on the AD+ P PSD proteome signature. Discussion We hypothesized that AD+ P arises from a more severe synap-topathy than that which is present in AD-P, based on multiple studies that have compared indirect measures of synapse integrity both in vivo and in postmortem tissue, between AD+ P and AD-P groups 15. In the current report we provide a direct comparison of the PSD proteomes between AD + P and AD-P subjects, ﬁnding a shift to reduced levels of multiple proteins in the PSD of AD + P. Relative to AD-P, PSDs from AD+ P subjects had lower levels of protein kinases which participate in a network that is also enriched for proteins with nominally signiﬁcantly reduced levels in AD + P and for functions implicated in signaling to post-synaptic structural elements. The PSD protein reductions in AD + P relative to AD-P were not accounted for by the altered burden of neuropathologies or the greater reduction in excitatory neurons that we have previously reported in AD+ P relative to AD-P. We were then able computationally identify several novel drug treatments predicted to reverse the PSD proteome signature of AD + P, and conﬁrm that at least one of them, maraviroc, could reverse this signature in mouse cortex after short-term systemic administration. Given the prominent role post-synaptic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton plays in the maintenance and plasticity of dendritic spines18, it is not surprising that the PSD proteome of AD+ P was selectively depleted of proteins enriched for functions asso-ciated with actin regulation. The identiﬁcation of impairments of this signaling network provides an opportunity for identifying compounds that might have speci ﬁc therapeutic bene ﬁts for individuals with AD+ P. We used a novel computational strat-egy, examining the overlap of gene knockout signatures with the AD + P PSD proteome alterations to identify upstream genes amenable to perturbation by existing compounds to potentially reverse the PSD proteome alterations in AD+ P. We were able to conﬁrm this prediction for maraviroc, which generated a net reversal of the PSD proteome reductions present in AD+ Pi na mouse model. Of note, our measure of net drug effect, the Signed Jaccard Index, showed a substantially larger effect in the PSD proteome ( −0.01186) than that which was calculated using mRNA alterations induced by maraviroc in cultured neurons (−0.0009). The Signed Jaccard Index for the PSD proteome effect was similar to to the mean Signed Jaccard Index of−0.03264 that we reported for drugs indicated for treatment of CNS disease 20. While our computational prediction was conﬁrmed for mar-aviroc, several caveats persist. Our validation was conducted in adult wildtype mice. Further tests in mouse models expressing AD-associated pathologies are warranted. Although there is no deﬁnitive mouse model for psychosis in AD21, the PSD proteome signature of at least some models of Aβ overproduction overlap with that of AD+ P16. Even if maraviroc’s effects are further conﬁrmed in AD models, a number of limitations may arise when repurposing a drug developed for treating other conditions. For example, any medication used will be applied to frail elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities, so preferred agents would be documented to be well-tolerated in such a population. Maraviroc, which was developed for chronic treatment of HIV infection, may well meet this tolerability benchmark, as might one of the other medications we identiﬁed, fostamatinib, which was developed for chronic use in populations with serious auto-immune disease22,23. Finally, we note that our conﬁrmation for maraviroc need not hold true for the other identiﬁed compounds, which will require independent validation in intact neural model systems to evaluate their effects on the PSD. Nevertheless, our strategy identiﬁed several genes that could represent novel targets for addressing the synaptic impairments in AD+ P. For example, actin rod formation in neurons, which is promoted by agonism of the C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5), the target of maraviroc, has been increasingly recognized as a component of Alzheimer’s neuropathology that induces PSD loss24,25. Likewise, treatment with maraviroc improved cognition in a small study of individuals with HIV-associated neurocogni-tive disorder 26. Aurora Kinase B (AURKB), the target by which fostamatinib was identiﬁed as a drug of potential beneﬁt for AD + P, has recently been shown to play a role in promoting neurite formation during early neuronal development27 and to promote axonal repair after injury in post-mitotic neurons28. Additionally, we identiﬁed reductions in levels of group of protein kinases that interact with a network that also includes other altered PSD proteins which serve to regulate the cytoske-leton. The roles of many of these kinases in the synaptic plasticity processes that regulate the maintenance of dendritic spines is well established (e.g. CAMK2A29, LIMK130, typical31 and atypical32 PRKCs, TRIO33). Of interest, one of the atypical PRKCs, PRKCI, while not itself established as having a role in spine maintenance, was among the genes identiﬁed as nominally signiﬁcantly asso-ciated with AD+ P (Supplementary Data 6). We also identiﬁed TBK1, a kinase that when disrupted causes frontotemporal dementia/ALS and induces dendritic spine loss in animal models34. Albeit, whether TBK1 has a normative role in spine maintenance is not established. It is likely that not just PSD protein levels of these kinases, but their phosphorylation-dependent activation, and the extent of phosphorylation of their downstream targets, are altered in the PSD of AD + P relative to AD-P. Thus, an important future direction will be to delineate the phosphoproteome signature of the AD+ P PSD. Such an investigation may both help to nominate candidate therapies directly targeting the altered kinases and may provide another metric to assess the therapeutic potential of other drug candidates. We report theﬁrst study, to our knowledge, to directly inter-rogate the PSD in AD+ P. The abundance of numerous PSD proteins was reduced in AD + P relative to both AD-P and comparison subjects. Examination of the PSD proteome signature of AD+ P, relative to AD-P, revealed lower levels of an inter-acting set of protein kinases, regulators of Rho GTPases, and other protein regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. We were able to use the PSD protein signature of AD + P to computationally nominate several novel potential pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AD+ P, and provide initial experimental validation that administration of one of the nominated drugs, maraviroc, to adult mice yielded a net reversal of the PSD protein signature of AD + P. Future studies are required to evaluate the ability of maraviroc and the other identiﬁed drugs to reverse the AD+ P PSD proteome signature in animal models of AD-related pathologies and to delineate the phosphoproteome signature of the AD+ P PSD.",2493,22.pdf

Consistently, donanemab, a therapeutic antibody raised against Aβ3pE-42, has been shown to be effective in recent clinical trials. Although the primary Aβ produced physiologically is Aβ1-40/42, an explanation for how and why this physiological Aβ is converted to the pathological form remains elusive. Here, we present experimental evidence that accounts for the aging-associated Aβ3pE-42 deposition: Aβ3pE-42 was metabolically more stable than other Aβx-42 variants; deficiency of neprilysin, the major Aβ-degrading enzyme, induced a relatively selective deposition of Aβ3pE-42 in both APP transgenic and App knock-in mouse brains; Aβ3pE-42 deposition always colocalized with Pittsburgh compound B–positive cored plaques in APP transgenic mouse brains; and under aberrant conditions, such as a significant reduction in neprilysin activity, aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like were up-regulated in the progression of aging, and a proportion of Aβ1-42 may be processed to Aβ3pE-42.

67,"Metabolic resistance of Aβ3pE-42, a target epitope of the anti-Alzheimer therapeutic antibody, donanemab",2024,https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202402650,introduction,"Senile plaques, which are one of the key pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are composed of amyloidβ peptides (Aβs) with a variety of secondary and tertiary structures because of post-translational modifications (Saido , 1995, 1996). This heterogeneity appears to affect catabolism and aggregation rates, resulting in structural changes in plaques. It has been reported repeatedly that most of Aβ in the brains of aged humans and in Down syndrome starts with pyroglutamate (pE) at position 3 and ends at position 42 (Aβ3pE-42) (Harigaya , 1995; Saido , 1995, 1996; Iwatsubo , 1996; Lemere , 1996; Kawarabayashi , 2001; Frost , 2013). In contrast, transgenic (Tg) mice over-expressing human APP with pathogenic mutations primarily accumulate Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 (Sturchler-Pierrat , 1997; Kawarabayashi , 2001). We reassessed this observation in the brains of AD patients quantitatively using a panel of antibodies capable of distinguishing among amino-terminal variants or among carboxyl-terminal variants of Aβ and verified that the predominant Aβ variant in the brains of AD patients is indeed Aβ3pE-42 (>40% of total Aβ)(Fig S1). There is, however, some discrepancy among different reports regarding the quantity of Aβ variants, which vary depending on the methods employed. For instance, the group led by Michel Goedert, who used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and LC-MS/MS to resolve the cryo-EM structure of Aβ42 filaments from human brains, recently indicated that Aβ3pE-42 was a minor variant in the brains of AD patients and App knock-in (KI) mice (Yang , 2022). This inconsistency can be accounted for by the unique physicochemical nature of Aβ3pE-42, which is seldom recovered from reversed-phase HPLC under normal conditions (Table S1). However, the use of a heated (50°C) basic solvent containing betaine and limited proteolysis using lysyl endopeptidase allows full recovery in HPLC and detection by mass spectrometry, respectively. These observations explain the relatively low estimation of Aβ3pE-42 levels in some prior studies as well (Glenner & Wong, 1984, 2012; Wong , 1985; Mori , 1992). Consistently, Güntert  (2006) successfully detected Aβ3pE-42 in the human brain by mass spectrometry after sufficient proteolytic digestion. It is notable that a therapeutic antibody raised against this variant, donanemab, has been shown to be effective in recent clinical trials (Demattos , 2012; Sims , 2023). The selective deposition of this physiologically rare Aβ variant in the human brain appears to be attributed to its presumed metabolic stability and aggregation propensity because pyroglutamyl peptide is resistant to major aminopeptidases except for pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (Mori , 1992). In accordance with this, an immediate aminopeptidase-sensitive precursor of Aβ3pE-42, Aβ3E-42, is a very minor component in AD brain (Fig S1) (Table S2). However, our observations of in vivo Aβ1-42 catabolism demonstrated that specific endoproteolysis mediated by neprilysin (NEP), but not aminopeptidase, is the major rate-limiting step with Aβ10-37 as a catabolic intermediate (Iwata , 2000). Thus, it is unclear about the mechanisms underlying generation of Aβ3pE-42. In addition, the presence of Aβ variants with different amino-terminal structures in the AD brains may be explained by the assumption that they have different life spans. The present study aims to examine whether the amino-terminal structure of Aβx-42 influences its catabolic rate in vivo based on the diversity of its amino-terminal structure observed in the AD brain (Fig S1). The study also serves as an initial attempt to address the question “What determines the life spans of extracellular peptides, such as Aβs, in the brain?” For this purpose, we synthesized amino-terminal variants of Aβ internally radiolabeled with 3H at residues 2, 4, 9, and 17 and with 14C at 20, 29, 34, 40, and 42 (Fig S2) and analyzed their catabolic rates in the rat hippocampal tissue according to a previously reported method (Iwata , 2000). Furthermore, to elucidate possible pathways of Aβ3pE-40/42 generation, we analyzed amyloid pathologies in the brains of APP-Tg (Sturchler-Pierrat , 1997) and App KI mice (Saito , 2014) using various experimental paradigms, such as quantitative Western blot (WB) analysis, ELISA, mass spectrometry, and image analysis for immunohistochemistry and positron emission tomography (PET) of amyloid. We found that a deficiency of NEP, the major Aβ-degrading enzyme, up-regulated the compensatory pathway, where aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like (QPCTL) are involved, resulting in the formation and relatively selective accumulation of Aβ3pE-42 in the brains of both APP-Tg and App KI mice.",730,23.pdf
68,"Metabolic resistance of Aβ3pE-42, a target epitope of the anti-Alzheimer therapeutic antibody, donanemab",2024,https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202402650,result,"Catabolism of Aβx-42 variants in vivo The synthesized variants included Aβ1D(L-Asp)-42, Aβ1rD(D-Asp)-42, Aβ1AcD(acetyl-Asp)-42, Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, Aβ3pE-42, Aβ4F-42, and Aβ17L-42 (Fig S2). The results demonstrate that subtle differences in the amino-terminal structure have a profound influence on the way Aβ is catabolized (Figs 1A–F and S3, Table 1). First, Aβ3pE-42 was much more resistant to in vivo catabolism than Aβ1-42; most of it remained uncatabolized even 60 min after administration into the hippocampus, whereas Aβ1-42 was almost fully degraded within 30 min. This observation is consistent with the presumption attributing the selective deposition of Aβ3pE-42 in the human brain to its metabolic stability (Saido , 1995). In contrast, Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, and Aβ4F-42 were catabolized even more rapidly than Aβ1-42. These results clearly indicate the presence of structural determinants of life span in the amino-terminal sequence of Aβ. Again, these truncated Aβ peptides without pyroglutamate are consistently seen as minor components deposited in the senile human brain (Fig S1)(Saido , 1996). The catabolic stability of these Aβ variants therefore correlates well with their tendencies to be pathologically deposited in the human brain. The Aβ17L-42 (p3 fragment) appeared to have a longer in vivo half-life than Aβ1-42, but the difference was not statistically significant (Table 1). These observations also indicate that the loss of the first two amino acid residues, DA, is not the cause of the metabolic stability of Aβ3pE-42. Loss of the α-amino group and R-configuration of the first amino acid did not affect the metabolic rates, because Aβ1AcD-42 and Aβ1rD-42 were degraded at a rate similar to that of Aβ1-42 (Table 1 and Fig S3). The specific structure of Aβ3pE-42 seems to generate an anti-catabolism signal, as discussed below. The consistently facilitated catabolism of Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, and Aβ4F-42 also indicates that the amino-terminal aspartic residue of Aβ1-42 is involved in the regulation of the catabolic rate, generating an anti-catabolism signal that is milder than that of Aβ3pE-42. Because the rate-limiting step of Aβ1-42 degradation is catalyzed by NEP (Iwata , 2000, 2001), the conversion of Aβ1-42 to Aβ3pE-42 is likely to decelerate this process. The facilitation of catabolism by removal of aspartate from Aβ1-42, however, may possibly be accounted for by two distinct mechanisms: one is conversion to better substrates for NEP, and the other is participation of alternative catabolic pathway(s) with respect to Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, and Aβ4F-42. In any case, NEP may contribute to catabolism, because a catabolic intermediate similar to Aβ10-37 detected during Aβ1-42 degradation (Iwata , 2000) was observed (Fig 1, green arrowheads). A detailed analysis of the peptide fragments generated during the in vivo catabolism is required to clarify this notion. Effect of Mme deficiency on N1D- and N3pE-positive amyloid plaque deposition in the APP-Tg mouse brain We subsequently examined the effect of Mme (gene nomenclature of NEP) deficiency on deposition of amyloid plaques immunoreactive to various anti-Aβ antibodies including N1D and N3pE in the brains of APP-Tg mice (Fig 2A and B). Mme deficiency modestly increased N1D-positive amyloid plaques but induced a drastic increase in N3pE-positive plaques, particularly at and after 18 mo of age. Other immunostaining and thioflavin staining patterns were almost similar to that of N1D immunostaining. Large plaques were detected in the sections immunostained for N1D (Fig 2A) and plaque size distribution for both N1D- and N3pE-positive amyloid plaques. Interestingly, we found that plaque size was roughly divided into three clusters: smaller/cored plaques (≤300 μm2), intermediate plaques (1,500–4,500 μm2), and larger plaques (>20,000 μm2)(Figs 2C and S4). The numbers of both N1D- and N3pE-positive amyloid plaques presented (Fig 2B) with a distinct size distribution: N3pE immunoreactivity tended to be present in smaller/cored plaques (≤300 μm2) and intermediate plaques (1,500–4,500 μm2), whereas N1D was present in larger plaques (>20,000 μm2) in addition to the clusters of smaller/cored plaques and intermediate plaques. The relative increase in total N3pE-positive area by Mme deficiency was significantly larger than that of N1D-positive area (Fig 2D). Given that NEP expression invariably declines with age (Iwata , 2002; Wang , 2003; Russo , 2005; Hellstrom-Lindahl , 2008), it is notable that even heterozygous Mme deficiency, presenting an ~50% reduction in NEP activity (Iwata , 2001), thus resulted in a relative increase in the ratio of Aβ3pE-40/42 to Aβ1-40/42 (Fig 2D). We then analyzed the detergent-insoluble/formic acid–soluble fractions of these mouse brains by mass spectrometry after the digestion of the samples by lysyl endopeptidase (Figs 3A and B and S5 and Table S3). We detected not only Aβ1-16 but also Aβ3pE-16 in the brains of Mme−/−APP-Tg mice (Fig 3B). Interestingly, this fraction contained trace quantities of Aβ2-16 and Aβ3-16, which are precursors of Aβ3pE-x. Next, we further analyzed amounts of Aβs present in the soluble fraction and accumulated in the insoluble fraction of the brains of APP-Tg mice using Western blot (WB) analysis (Figs 4A–C and S6) and ELISA (Fig 4D), which showed that changes in amounts of Aβ immunoreactive to the anti-Aβ antibodies basically showed similar patterns as that obtained using immunohistochemistry: Mme deficiency prominently increased the amounts of Aβ3pE-x from middle age, but a difference in the amount of Aβ1-x between the two genotypes was not observed with the progression of age. In contrast, the amount of Aβ3pE-x in both genotypes kept increasing until 24 mo of age (Fig 4B and C), resulting in an increased ratio of Aβ3pE-40/42 to Aβ1-40/42 (Fig 4D, rightmost graph). Notably, detectable amounts of Aβ3pE-40/42 were present both in the soluble and in the insoluble fractions (the order level of pmol/g), although they were considerably less than that of Aβ1-40/42. Colocalization of Aβ3pE-42 with cored plaques in the Mme−/−APP-Tg mouse brain was examined using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), which is known to selectively bind to cored plaques (Maeda , 2007; Ikonomovic , 2008)(Fig 5). Aβ3pE-42–positive signals corresponding to PiB-binding sites were detected preferentially in the core of amyloid plaques, whereas Aβ1-42–positive signals were observed in larger amyloid plaques (Fig 5A) and the PiB binding was increased in Mme−/−APP-Tg mice in a manner colocalizing with N3pE-positive cored plaques in a significant way (Fig 5B, left panel, and Fig 5C). PET analysis also showed an increase of in vivo binding of PiB in the Mme−/−APP-Tg mice in an age-dependent manner (Fig 5B, right panel, and Fig 5D). Furthermore, we found that Aβ3pE-40/42, but not Aβ1-40/42, colocalized well with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is known to be involved in Aβ aggregation (Nilsson , 2004), in the cores of amyloid plaques (Fig S7A). Intensities of ApoE-positive signals in the amyloid plaques and levels of ApoE and α1-antichymotrypsin in the soluble fraction were significantly elevated by the Mme deficiency in the 24-mo-old APP-Tg mice (Fig S7B and C). These observations consistently indicated that Mme deficiency increases the cored plaque–associated Aβ3pE-42. Generation and analysis of AppNL-(ΔDA)-F and AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F knock-in mouse lines We next aimed to reproduce Aβ3pE-42 pathology in mouse models, for which two knock-in mouse lines were generated: AppNL-(ΔDA)-F and AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F (Fig 6A). This strategy was based on our previous experimental results showing that primary neurons expressing APP cDNA with the first two amino acid residues of Aβ deleted (NL[ΔDA]E) produced Aβ3E-40/42 and that those in which E had been replaced by Q (NL[ΔDA]Q) produced Aβ3pE-40/42 (Shirotani , 2002). First, using the AppNL-F line of App KI mice we confirmed the effects of Mme deficiency as obtained with APP-Tg mice. Incidentally, Mme deficiency not only accelerated the deposition of both Aβ1-42 and Aβ3pE-42 in the AppNL-F line, but also increased the ratio of Aβ3pE-42 to Aβ1-42 (Fig 6B). When we analyzed new lines of App KI mice, we were indeed able to detect a trace amount (~1 fmol/g) of Aβ3pE-42 only in the brains of AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F mice at 2 mo of age (Fig S8). Despite our expectation, neither the AppNL-(ΔDA)-F nor the AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F lines exhibited any visible Aβ pathology at all, even after aging (i.e., 18 mo or more) (Fig 6C). Notably, biochemical quantification indicated that the AppNL-F line deposited more Aβ3pE-42 than the AppNL-(ΔDA)-F and AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F lines (Fig 6D), consistently indicating that Aβ3E-42 and Aβ3Q-42 are much more short-lived than Aβ1-42 after production in vivo. In any case, both histochemical and biochemical analyses of APP-Tg (Figs 2, 4, and 5) and AppNL-F line of App KI mice (Figs 6B and S9A) consistently indicated that deposition of Aβ3pE-42 takes place much later than that of Aβ1-42. The biochemical quantity of Aβ3pE-42 accounts for only 0.1% of total Aβ42 in the insoluble fraction of 24-mo-old AppNL-F mouse brains (Fig S9B and C). Changes in expression levels of exopeptidases and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferases involved in AβN3pE generation by Mme deficiency We assumed that a potential pathway where aminopeptidases and dipeptidyl peptidases may be involved (Fig S10) could compensate for physiological Aβ degradation decreased by Mme deficiency. Our findings show that aminopeptidase A (APN), aminopeptidase N (APN), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which were immunopurified from the membrane fraction of mouse brains, displayed Aβ-degrading activity (Fig 7A). Among them, DPP4 exhibited the highest activity. Protein contents were in the order of APN > APA > DPP4, but DPP4 had the highest specific activity (Fig 7C), suggesting that it plays a significant role in truncating amino-terminal amino acids (DA). Our results showed that the expression levels of APN, DPP4, and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like (QPCTL) were up-regulated by Mme deficiency, whereas the expression level of thyrotropin-releasing hormone–degrading enzyme, a pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase, was decreased (Fig 7D and E).",1565,23.pdf

Methods A 2-sample mendelian randomization study design was applied to examine the association between genetic variation in the targets of 4 antidiabetic drug classes and AD risk. Genetic summary statistics for blood glucose were analyzed using UK Biobank data of 326,885 participants, whereas summary statistics for AD were retrieved from previous genome-wide association studies comprising 24,087 clinically diagnosed AD cases and 55,058 controls. Positive control analysis on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and obesity-related traits was conducted to validate the selection of instrumental variables. Results In the positive control analysis, genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with higher insulin secretion, a lower risk of T2DM, and an increment in body mass index, waist circumference, and hip circumference, consistent with drug mechanistic actions and previous trial evidence. In the primary analysis, genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with a lower risk of AD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.19– 0.72, p = 0.0034). These results for sulfonylureas were largely unchanged in the sensitivity analysis using a genetic variant,rs757110, that has been validated to modulate the target proteins of sulfonylureas (OR = 0.35 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.15– 0.82, p = 0.016). An association between genetic variations in the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue target and a lower risk of AD was also observed (OR = 0.32 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.13– 0.79, p = 0.014). However, this result should be interpreted with caution because the positive control analyses for GLP-1 analogues did not comply with a weight-loss effect as shown in previous clinical trials. Results regarding other drug classes were inconclusive. Discussion Genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with a lower risk of AD, and future studies are warranted to clarify the underlying mechanistic pathways between sulfonylureas and AD.",337,25.pdf
70,Genetic Variation in Targets of Antidiabetic Drugs and Alzheimer Disease Risk,2022,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000200771,introduction,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, characterized by aberrant protein aggregation and neuronal loss in the brain that leads to cognitive decline, memory loss, and ultimately death. However, currently, only a few agents or drugs that can improve symptoms have been approved for AD, whereas their neuroprotective effects remain uncertain. Developing new drugs for AD is imperative but also extremely challenging with more than 400 candidates recently failed in phase III trials. Drug repurposing or repositioning, where approved drugs are tested for a novel indication, has been proposed as a more rapid and cost-effective strategy to identify potential AD treatments because approved drugs possess well-documented information for mechanism of actions and comprehensive safety profiles. AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are 2 of the most prevalent diseases in the aged population. A meta-analysis of 1,746,777 participants reported a 53% higher risk of developing AD in patients with T2DM. Besides, AD has been proposed as “type 3 diabetes” with insulin resistance and impaired glucose control in the brain. Antidiabetic drugs, based on their original intention of enhancing insulin signaling and regulating glucose metabolism, have been highlighted as repurposing candidates for AD. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted in patients with early or mild-to-moderate AD to investigate the disease-modifying effects of antidiabetic drugs, but the evidence to date was inconclusive. Given the long prodromal phase of AD, clinical trials targeting early or mild-to-moderate AD have been considered belated, whereas primary intervention in preclinical AD or even earlier may offer the best opportunity of therapeutic success. However, such primary prevention trials are challenging because they require considerably large sample sizes and long-duration intervention. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical tool using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to make causal inference between exposure(s) and outcome(s). Because genetic variants are assigned randomly at conception and before disease onset, MR is considered as a“natural” RCT, which can minimize confounding and reverse causation. Particularly for the genetic variants within the genes that encode drug target proteins, such variants may influence the expression of genes, modulate the function of encoded proteins, and thereby closely proxy drug mechanism actions. In the spirit of natural RCTs, MR studies leveraging such druggable variants are useful in identifying drug repurposing opportunities and predicting side effects. An MR study used a variant on the HMGCR gene to proxy statin use and found that genetically mimicked statin use was associated with a higher risk of T2DM, consistent with the evidence from an RCT of 129,170 participants. Apart from controlling for confounding and reverse causality, MR also provides the possibility to emulate primary prevention trials that comprise large sample sizes (recent genetic discoveries are usually based on hundreds of thousands of participants) and long intervention duration (genetically instrumented exposure occurs before the outcome and is lifelong). Hence, we conducted an MR study to examine the effects of genetic variation in antidiabetic drug targets on AD risk.",486,25.pdf
71,Genetic Variation in Targets of Antidiabetic Drugs and Alzheimer Disease Risk,2022,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000200771,result,"Positive Control Analyses As shown in Figure 2, panel A, genetic variation in the targets of TZD, sulfonylureas, insulin analogues, and GLP-1 analogues was associated with a decreased risk of T2DM. When looking into insulin secretion and insulin resistance (Figure 2, panels B and C), genetic variation in the targets of sulfonylureas and GLP-1 analogues was associated with increased insulin secretion, whereas insulin/insulin analogues and TZD were associated with decreased insulin resistance, consistent with the drug mechanism of actions. For obesity-related traits (Figure 2, panels D– F), the estimates for TZD and sulfonylureas suggested increment in BMI, WC, and HIP, consistent with evidence from the meta-analysis of clinical trials. However, the estimates for insulin/insulin analogues and GLP-1 analogues were varying across the 3 obesity-related traits. Effects of Genetic Variation in Antidiabetic Drug Targets on AD Risk The results from our primary analysis using a GWAS dataset that contains 24,087 clinically diagnosed late-onset AD cases are shown in Figure 3. Generally, genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with a reduced risk of AD at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.19– 0.72, p = 0.0034). The association was consistent in the analysis using the validated proxy,rs757110 (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.15– 0.82, p = 0.016). Meanwhile, the estimates for sulfonylureas in the weighted median method (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.17– 0.84) and MR-Egger regression (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.05– 3.79) also confirmed a reduced risk of AD, although with a wider CI as the MR-Egger regression produces larger standard errors than the conventional IVW method (eTable 4, links.lww.com/WNL/C91). Besides, a suggestive association between genetic variation in the GLP-1 analogue target and lower risk of AD was observed across different MR methods (Figure 3 and eTable 4, links.lww.com/WNL/C91, IVW: OR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.13– 0.79, p = 0.014; weighted median: OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.11– 1.07, p = 0.066; MR-Egger: OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.05– 2.52, p = 0.49). For all the estimates, no heterogeneity within IVs or substantial pleiotropy was detected (Figure 3, p for heterogeneity >0.05,p for pleiotropy >0.05). In the sensitivity analysis using a GWAS dataset comprising 71,880 AD/AD-by-proxy cases (eFigure 2, links.lww.com/WNL/C91), genetic variation in the targets of sulfonylureas and GLP-1 analogues showed protective effects (sulfonylureas: OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.58– 1.05; GLP-1 analogues: OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.37– 0.77), although the effect sizes attenuated toward the null possibly because of the dilution effects by AD-by-proxy cases. Considering the possible uncertainty arising from instrumenting each drug class with a relatively small number of IVs, we conducted a sensitivity analysis retaining more partially independent IVs by clumping the variants with relaxing R2. The estimates for sulfonylureas and GLP-1 analogues stabilized throughout the R2 ranging from 0.001 to 0.50; meanwhile, the standard error decreased with more IVs being included. However, the estimates insulin analogue and TZD varied across different R2 and included the null (Figure 4). Colocalization Analysis for Sulfonylureas and GLP-1 Analogues Colocalization analysis was performed for sulfonylureas and GLP-1 analogues within the drug target encoding genes (±2,500 base pairs ofKCNJ11 and ABCC8 for sulfonylureas and ofGLP1R for GLP-1 analogues). The results are shown in eTable 5, links.lww.com/WNL/C91. Generally, we did not observe strong evidence suggesting colocalization between blood glucose and AD within the 2 gene regions for sulfonylureas (probability for sharing 1 common causal variant: 2.5% in KCNJ11 and 3.9% inABCC8); however, when looking into the regional association plots (eFigure 3, links.lww.com/WNL/C91), a trend of colocalization was noted. For GLP-1 analogues, we did not find any evidence of either sharing a common variant or a distinct trend of colocalization withinGLP1R (eTable 5 and eFigure 4, links.lww.com/WNL/C91).

Based on this integrative workflow, we identified 77 druggable modifiers of tau phosphorylation (pTau). One of the upstream modulators of pTau, HDAC6, was screened with 5,632 drugs in a tau-specific assay, resulting in the identification of 20 repurposing candidates. Four compounds and their known targets were found to have a link to AD-specific genes.

73,A hybrid approach unveils drug repurposing candidates targeting an Alzheimer pathophysiology mechanism,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100433,introduction,"Aging societies face a rapidly growing number of people suffering from AD, resulting in an enormous socioeconomic burden.1 Billions of dollars are invested to address this problem, but despite all efforts to find effective therapeutics, treatment options are sparse and have largely failed to achieve satisfying results in the fight against AD. More than 100 candidate compounds were abandoned in development or showed disappointing results in clinical trials (CTs), leaving only a limited number of remedies that are currently approved and used for symptomatic treatment of AD.2 THE BIGGER PICTURE Owing to current setbacks in the discovery and development of novel treatments tackling Alzheimer disease (AD), a re-evaluation of research and development (R&D) strategies is underway. Here, we present a holistic pharmacological approach that combines drug-target information with knowledge graphs that represent essential pathophysiology mechanisms. The resulting Human Brain Pharmacome (HBP) embeds hundreds of relevant drug-target interactions in the context of disease mechanisms governing AD. We demonstrate how such a tool can be used to aid AD research by identifying already-approved drugs that have the potential to treat the disease, thereby bypassing the expensive and time-consuming task of researching and developing a new drug. In our study, we identified new drug-target combinations and provided mechanistic explanations that help to improve our understanding of AD pathology and support future development of effective therapeutic strategies. Development/Pre-production: Data science output has been rolled out/validated across multiple domains/problems Patterns 3, 100433, March 11, 2022a 2022 The Authors. 1 This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). ll OPEN ACCESS Why do CTs in AD treatment continue to fail? An incomplete understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, erroneous selection of target and drug candidates, shortcomings of pre-clinical animal models, wrong drug dosage regimens, and false recruiting of best responders are some of the reasons why these clinical studies have so far failed.3,4 Novel therapeutic avenues must be established, and achieving this requires a re-evaluation of the strategies currently used. Drug repurposing, the process of identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, has grown in popularity in recent years and has been shown to be quite successful.5,6 This strategy, also referred to as drug repositioning, offers an enormous advantage: substances that have already been well examined and approved with a wide spectrum of data, including safety and efficiency profiles, can be critically evaluated in a new disease context. Drug repurposing maximizes the therapeutic application of drugs while minimizing the risk of failure, leading to a reduced period of time by which they are ready for the market with a new indication context.7 Repositioning of drugs can be driven by structuralin silicoanalyses (e.g., molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, or cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) or X-ray structural determination)8 or by the experimental domain (in vitro biochemical and cellular assays, high-throughput screening, in vivo animal tests),9,10 or approached through a combination of both fields.11 Generally, drug repurposing strategies are drug, target, or disease centric depending on the research focus or pharmaceutical interest.12 In a drug-centric approach, a drug is connected to a formerly unknown target (off-target) and its target-associated indications, whereas in a target-centric approach, the drug-target relationship is known (on-target) and linked to a new therapeutic context. New avenues of drug repurposing are being explored, including signature-based approaches that focus on evidence-driven identification of new repurposing compounds,13 which is in line with our mechanism-oriented strategy. In the repurposing approach described here, we are not restricted to a single approach, therefore allowing greater flexibility in terms of repositioning candidate identification. We combined knowledge mined from a variety of sources with focused experimental screening data of selected drug candidates into our drug-target-mechanism-oriented data model, the Human Brain Pharmacome (HBP). Information retrieval and extraction were applied in a reciprocal manner for the enrichment of targets, ligands, chemical similarity, or assays in the HBP. The enrichment of our computational model was complemented by information extracted from the patent literature as well as quantitative information extracted from tables in published articles. Dedicated mining strategies enabled us to use this information for drug/target prospective and retrospective validation as well as for assay refinement. The dynamic nature of literature and the continuous research efforts in AD prompted us to develop and implement processes for progressive updates of the knowledge graph with several internal checks to ensure that novel and even controversial findings were added back to the HBP with full provenance of the information source. Here, we demonstrate our approach in an AD-biomarker-centric search strategy. The HBP model includes a highly granular representation of mechanistic underpinnings of tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of abnormal microtubule-associated tau protein (MAPT) in the brain in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).14,15 Phosphorylation of MAPT (pTau), and thus creation of insoluble aggregates, is considered one of the key regulatory factors that drives AD pathology, and its abundance is used as a predictive biomarker of AD.16 Based on our work in the pTau context, we implemented a generalizable workflow (Figure 1; Video S1) for the identification of new druggable targets in relation to AD-specific pathophysiology processes. In ourin silico-driven knowledge mining approach, we focused on mechanisms related to post-translational modifications. Starting with pTau as the root node (primary target, see methods), we sought to answer the following questions in the context of this AD pathological hallmark: 1) Are there druggable targets (secondary targets, see methods) that modulate pTau? 2) Which of the targets identified in (1) are putative repurposing targets based on qualitative and quantitative data analysis? 3) Which repurposing compounds are highly active in our pTau-focused experimental setting? 4) Can we validate unknown drug-target pairs in the context of AD therapeutics?",939,26.pdf
74,A hybrid approach unveils drug repurposing candidates targeting an Alzheimer pathophysiology mechanism,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100433,result,"The HBP We created a drug- and mechanism-oriented model, the HBP, that covers a broad spectrum of biological processes relevant in the pathophysiological context of AD (Figures 2A and 2B). By augmenting it with metadata, quantitative data, and contextual information, we have created a comprehensive framework forin silico identification of druggable mechanisms and a broad information base for evaluating potential therapeutic targets and agents. Identification of druggable modulators of pTau Using our secondary target selection pipeline (see methods), we identified 77 druggable targets (cited in 155 documents) that also have an upstream causal interaction with pTau (Figures 2A and 2C; Data S1). Our initial list contained proteins from several different gene families: MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, MAPK9, MAPK10, MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13, and MAPK14 (mitogen-activated protein kinases); PPP1CA, PPP2CA, PPP2CB, PPP3CA, and PPP5C (protein phosphatase catalytic subunits); PPP2R1A and PPP2R2A (protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunits); S100A1 and S100B (S100 calcium binding proteins); CDK1, CDK2, CDK5, and CDK5R1 (cyclin dependent kinases); CAMK2A and CAMK2B (calmodulin dependent protein kinases); and ABL1 and ABL2 (Abl family tyrosine kinases). Cross-validation of protein-protein-interaction data from several resources (IntAct, BioGRID, Pathway Commons, STRING, https://bikmi.pharmacome.scaiview.com/) confirmed 54 of these targets as direct interactors of pTau (Data S2). Qualitative and quantitative data analysis reveal putative repurposing targets One of our primary goals was to find new or repurposed compounds for treating pTau in the context of AD. To this end, we performed a statistical analysis of the secondary target metadata to identify the best candidate for additional screening (Data S1). First, we determined the number of BioAssays available for each secondary target to evaluate which of our candidate proteins had the most screening data available. These calculations are indicative of the number of known drug-target interactions as confirmed by several independent studies and serve as better values to evaluate protein/compound associations as opposed to looking purely at drugs that are approved and on the market. Our search resulted in a list of the top five ranked proteins: HDAC6, ABL1, CDK2, MAPK14, and SRC with 1,938, 1,929, 1,518, 1,490, and 1,363 BioAssay mentions, respectively. We then calculated the ratio of these counts to the number of available drugs for each protein, thereby determining which candidates had the greatest opportunity for drug repurposing exploration. Based on the information mined from DrugBank, HDAC6 had the highest BioAssay-to-known-drug ratio of the top five candidates with 1,938 available assays at the time of writing and only six approved drugs on the market, thus making it a prime candidate for testing potential new therapeutic compounds. Additionally, among the top five ranked proteins, HDAC6 had the fewest mentions within the parsed corpus of patents. Furthermore, research into the current clinical trial landscape revealed that there is only one trial in the recruiting phase in context of both AD and an approved HDAC6 selective compound (NCT03056495; Data S1). Therefore, assay availability, the lack of market-available or patented drugs, and the sparse clinical focus strongly argue in favor of HDAC6 as a suitable target candidate to demonstrate our repurposing selection workflow. Secondary-target candidate selection: HDAC6 Research into HDAC6 revealed that it was previously the focus of cancer research 20 owing to its role in chromatin remodeling, cell motility, and gene regulation.21 However, HDAC6 activity has also been shown to influence the structure of microtubules, thus making it an enticing candidate in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.22,23 Interestingly, the HBP revealed a new potential intervention pathway: HDAC6 was shown to have a direct influence on acetylation of pTau.19 According to Carlomagno ., HDAC6 mediated deacetylation of tau at certain sites (such as K321; Figure 3A), which also allow for phosphorylation of the tau protein (pTau).24 One such study reported that HDAC6 activity at K280 and K281 positively correlated with the pTau protein abundance,25 while another group demonstrated that a direct acetylation of MAPT was shown to favor the generation of pathological pTau aggregates.26 The study mentioned first suggests that the inhibition of HDAC6 and thereby the acetylation of K280 and K281, should lead to a decrease in harmful pTau aggregation by indirectly preventing phosphorylation from taking place at key residues. We have adapted this information in our hypothesis (Figure 2C). Though the dynamics of the post-translational modifications of MAPT, their mutual influence, and the downstream effects on the formation of pathological tau tangles are not fully understood, especially in a human context, HDAC6 does appear to have a central role in which disease-relevant signal cascades in AD are integrated. Experimental validation of HDAC6 and candidate compounds As classical HDAC6 assays often use consensus sequences derived from histone substrates, we sought to use a more specific readout for our experimental validation step. We therefore developed a substrate derived from amino acid (AA) sites 278–281 of the human tau protein, which was shown to be directly linked to pathological tau aggregation.26 This peptide, Ile-Asn-(dimethyl) Lys-(ac)Lys was used for the development of our in-house Figure 1. Generalized workflow for identifying novel therapeutic strategies (1) A knowledge-based ‘‘cause-and-effect’’ disease model (here: Alzheimer disease) is initiated using manually curated information as well as standardized data from reputable repositories (see ‘‘The HBP’’ in results). (2) An entry point (primary target; here: pTau) associated with a pathophysiology mechanism of interest is selected, and upstream regulators (secondary interactors) modulating key elements of this mechanism are identified (see ‘‘Identification of druggable modulators of pTau’’ in results). (3) The secondary interactors are ranked according to chosen criteria, and the top hits are selected for further evaluation (see ‘‘Qualitative and quantitative data analysis reveal putative repurposing targets’’ and ‘‘Secondary-target candidate selection: HDAC6 ’’ in results). (4) Suitable biochemical and cellular assays are chosen for testing the activities of a library of compounds against top secondary interactors (see ‘‘Experimental validation of HDAC6 and candidate compounds’’ in results). (5) Experimental results are quantitatively analyzed to identify new repurposing drugs and compounds for each given secondary interactor (see ‘‘Mapping of identified HDAC6 inhibitors to the HBP’’ in results). (6) Novel target/compound combinations are designed and used to gain new insights for future experiments. (7) Earmarked combinations and screening data are mapped to the knowledge graph to enhance future queries (see ‘‘General applicability of the HBP’’ in results). From here, an entry point of interest can be selected to reinitiate the pipeline. HDAC6 assay (Figures 3A and 3B) and validated against two un-specific standard inhibitors, vorinostat (SAHA) and trichostatin A. These inhibitors had half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of 3.1 nM and 2 nM respectively, concentrations that are similar to those found in a histone-based HDAC6 assay (6.2 nM and 3.8 nM, respectively).28 This result not only reflects the overlapping specificity of the two catalytic HDAC6 domains,29 but also demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and the direct involvement of HDAC6 at K281 deacetylation of human tau. To identify promising HDAC6 inhibitors that can modulate its activity on human tau, we screened a collection of drugs to identify those with the greatest effect on tau peptide deacetylation. A B C Figure 2. Cause-and-effect model generation, enrichment, and identification of druggable modulators of pTau (A) Workflow illustrating the stepwise formation of a data-enriched cause-and-effect model, subsequent knowledge mining, and target analysis. (B) Beginning with the entire Human Brain PHARMACOME, a primary target is selected (pTau) and its cause-and-effect context (tau subgraph, magnified square) is defined. (C) Illustration of a drug-HDAC6-MAPT relational network17,18 in BiKMi, available at https://bikmi.pharmacome.scaiview.com/ left). The graph can be generated by applying the path query: From: ‘‘6675804’’, To: ‘‘MAPT’’, Depth 2-2. The ""Depth"" limits the size of the network by specifying the number of edge steps searched for between the ‘‘From’’ and ‘‘To’’ entities. Each node (box) represents a specific subject/object (according to BEL). Each edge (line) is a unique source of evidence. The graphical representations from BiKMi are simplified representations of BEL subgraphs. Because it was listed as one of the druggable secondary targets, HDAC6 was further investigated using this tool. This network provided evidence (evidence boxes not shown) that HDAC6 is known to deacetylate tau19 (edge highlighted with ‘‘a’’), which correlates with tau phosphorylation17 (edge highlighted with ‘‘b’’). As the network (left) indicates, pharmacological HDAC6 inhibition (edge highlighted with ‘‘c’’) resulted in reduced tau phosphorylation17 (edge highlighted with ‘‘d’’). Based on these known relationships, we hypothesized (right) that inhibition of HDAC6 (indicated by ‘‘c’’) blocks (crossed out edge) the tau deacetylation process (indicated by ‘‘a’’), which leads in turn to a decrease in pTau (effect indicated by ‘‘d,’’ dotted arrow; reduction of pTau is indicated in red) by indirectly preventing phosphorylation at key residues through remaining acetylation (green). The edges (left and right) marked with the same lowercase letter correspond to each other. In total, 5,632 compounds were screened on 16 plates with a z0 exceeding 0.5 on all plates. The average signal intensity of all data points was 1.4% inhibition, indicating no systematic errors were present within the screening, with a standard deviation of 0.35. Interestingly, 65% of the 279 active molecules from the primary screening were confirmed as hits, with a hit being defined as a compound showing at least 75% inhibition. Such a confirmation rate is reasonable for this type of complex and coupled enzymatic assay. To validate the 183 confirmed active compounds, a second HDAC6 screening was conducted in addition to dose response studies (Figure 3D). This assay employing a shorter, less specific peptide derived from histone H3 resulted in 104 compounds inhibiting to at least 75%. From these, 23 molecules were found to be specific for the histone H3 substrate, and 81 inhibited the conversion of both substrates. As a result, 102 compounds from the tau-based screening were specific for this substrate and subjected to dose response studies (Figures 3C and 3D). In the following step, their activities were confirmed, and the 20 molecules that specifically were found to be the most active in inhibiting tau-based substrate conversion and had favorable physicochemical properties (Figure 3; Table S3) were selected. Suitable properties included drug likeliness, taking into account molecular weight (MW), solubility, and rule of five criteria,30 as well as likeliness for central nervous system (CNS) penetration (topological polar surface area [TPSA] below 100) and having fewer than 8 rotatable bonds, although certain molecules were still included even if one of the rules was violated (Table S4). These compounds were further validated using western blots against pTau (Figures 3E and 3F). The reduced phosphorylation of tau further demonstrated the applicability of HDAC6 inhibitors in the context of tau hyperphosphorylation and may represent promising avenues for AD therapy. Mapping identified HDAC6 inhibitors to the HBP The compounds found to inhibit HDAC6 activity were queried against the ChEMBL database to determine any additional drug targets for these molecules (Figure 4A). During data collection, we made sure that two parameters were controlled: pCHEMBL >6 and confidence level >7 were used. A pCHEMBL value of more than 6 signifies that all measurementss of inhibition are less than 1mM (pIC 50 = negative log 6 [IC50 in mM]). The confidence level corresponds to the ChEMBL confidence score (see https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/frequently-asked-questions/chembl-data-questions).With these two parameters, we were able to control the quality of the data sampled as well as the potency of the interactions surveyed. Of the 20 compounds, 17 were found to interact with targets other than HDAC6. Using information collected from the GWAS Catalog,31 a list of known, disease-associated genes was compiled based on identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (p < 10/C07) and compared against the compound targets. Only four of the drugs—quercetin (ChEMBL: CHEMBL50), GW441756X (ChEMBL:CHEMBL1516890), Debio 1347 (ChEMBL:CHEMBL3907479), and indirubin-3 0-monoxime (ChEMBL:CHEMBL216543)—targeted proteins that were found to be associated with AD (Figure 4B; Data S3). It was not surprising that quercetin and GW441756X would have additional targets of interest, as these compounds were found to interact with the greatest number of molecules from those in our list (80 and 62, respectively). Interestingly, of the eight overlapping hits from the AD association analysis, three were found to be targeted by multiple drugs in our list. CDK1 and CSNK2A1 are both targets of quercetin and GW441756X, while GSK3B was also found to be modulated by these compounds as well as indirubin-3 0-monoxime. Based on the information collected from the GWAS Catalog, we were able to calculate what percentage of each compound’s target list was associated with AD (Figure 4C). We found that indirubin-30-monoxime had the highest score, with 33.3% of its targets being associated with AD, while Debio-1347 had the second highest score at 14.7%. This suggests that indirubin-3 0-monoxime would have the greatest chance of repurposing due to its strong focus on AD-related targets. To extract additional information on the candidate compounds in relation to the primary (pTau)/secondary (HDAC6) targets, queries consisting of concepts and keywords were generated and executed using https://pharmacome.scaiview.com/ (Figure 4D; Data S4). Debio-1347 was not found in the context of HDAC6, MAPT, or AD, whereas quercetin has clear connections to these molecules (230 and 1,416 mentions, respectively) and AD (1,679 mentions). Meanwhile, both indirubin-3 0-monoxime and GW441756X were found to be mentioned in publications in association with MAPT (13 and 4 mentions, respectively) and AD (6 and 7 mentions, respectively). Next, we searched both ClinicalTrials.gov and patent literature for recent information on the candidate compounds and any ongoing investigations into their therapeutic uses. Again, among these four compounds, only quercetin has been used in a clinical trial performed in the context of AD (a total of 4 trials were found). A patent search via dedicated concept queries and analysis of disease-related topics (Medical Subject Headings [MeSH]) extended the coverage of the elucidated contextual information. For Debio-1347 and GW441756X compounds, cancer-related terms dominated the results, with a relevance score (Kullback-Leibler divergence) of 6.12 for ‘‘small cell lung carcinoma’’ (Debio-1347) and 5.98 for ‘‘glioblastoma’’ (GW441756X), whereas indirubin-3 0-monoxime appeared in an inflammatory context first (‘‘prostatitis’’ relevance score: 3.67), followed by ‘‘hemangiosarcoma’’ (relevance score: 3.65). For quercetin, a broad range of disease context information could be identified (Figures S4 and S5; Data S4). All four compounds were mentioned together with the MeSH terms ‘‘arthritis,’’ ‘‘asthma,’’ ‘‘colitis,’’ ‘‘fibrosis,’’ ‘‘hemangiosarcoma,’’ ‘‘multiple myeloma,’’ ‘‘psoriasis,’’ ‘‘stomach neoplasm,’’ and ‘‘wounds and injuries.’’ Only patents containing the compounds quercetin and indirubin-3 0-monoxime specifically contained MeSH terms in the context of neurodegenerative disorders (quercetin: ‘‘Alzheimer disease,’’ ‘‘Parkinson disease,’’ ‘‘nervous system diseases’’; both: ‘‘plaque, amyloid’’). Because of their relevance to AD (Figure 4B), these four selected compounds and their identified targets were mapped to the HBP to improve the performance of subsequent iterations of the pipeline. A new node was created for any drug or protein that did not already exist within the network, and generated edges were annotated with the parsed interaction information. In summary, our computational analysis identified repurposing candidate compounds based on their proximity to protein targets and biological pathways relevant to AD pathology. Among those, indirubin-3 0-monoxime had the highest score based on the ratio of AD-relevant genes and pathways it targets, suggesting that it would serve as a suitable, focused therapeutic, while minimizing potential side effects due to off-target interactions. Furthermore, cellular characterization of AD-relevant cell types and evidence collected from literature that include this compound revealed the mechanism by which it can positively regulate AD, thereby strengthening it as a potential repurposing candidate and further validating our pipeline. General applicability of the HBP With the HBP, we have created a computational model that links drugs, their targets, and highly associated mechanisms. This complex framework of interactions spans multiple modalities and consists of biological processes complemented by highly granular representations of biological mechanisms. Though this model focuses primarily on AD, it can also be used to explore other diseases that share pathological aspects with AD. The HBP is enriched with qualitative and quantitative data, thus facilitating the ability to filter data using a variety of metadata, the development of specific assays, and the assessment of experimental data. Though our pipeline was initiated using a modified protein, it is not limited to this type of entity. A primary target can also be a biological process in the form of a single entity or an entire subgraph. A drug could also serve as the starting point forin silico processing and in vitro validation (or vice versa). The flexibility of this workflow enables far-reaching possibilities in terms of potential biological questions and hypothesis generation. For example, assume that a biological process, such as autophagy, is the entry point (primary target) of our workflow. Pathological autophagic processes play an essential role across diseases32 as in AD.33 Therefore, this primary target would allow one to start from thein vitro perspective and answer the following question: Which repurposing compounds have a regulatory effect on autophagy? In a subsequent step, one could determine where the compound-specific targets (secondary targets) are located in the graph. These targets could be in a relationship with autophagy itself or affect a process or another protein target that are elements of the autophagic process. This information can be used to hypothesize potential mechanisms of action in the autophagy context, which in turn could be tested via appropriate in vitro assays. In theory, the HBP could provide possible explanations for how compounds work in the autophagy context. In summary, our network and the associated hybrid workflow offer a wide range of opportunities to answer open questions in the search for appropriate approaches to new therapeutic treatments, extending beyond the context of AD.",2877,26.pdf

Though they are originated from barbituric acid, which is actually pharmaceutically inactive one but its derivatives were practically verified drug moiety [1-3]. On the account of this pharmacological potential, they are widely used in variety of disease treatment. Apart from this application, they found as intermediates in organic synthesis [4] and the synthesis of other bioactive molecules like pigment, vitamin B12, etc. [5,6]. With all these applications barbituric acid derivatives attract much attention of researchers. However, the reported methods of synthesis have encountered some limitations, such as long time to complete reaction, reduced yields, extreme reaction conditions, the requirement of high price catalysts and needs special kind of apparatus. So, to overcome the stated restrictions, the finding of an altered and proficient process for the production of 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-barbituric acid derivatives is of foremost concern. In the past decade, green synthesis of nanoparticles has evolved as an important branch of nanotechnology because of its potential application in the biomedical, magnetics, energy science and aerospace industries [7]. Due to Lewis acid nature of gold, it has gained tremendous attention in organic synthesis [8]. The nanosized gold particles shows excellent catalytic activity than its bulk structure [9,10]. Gold nanoparticles has found significant catalyst in nearly all organic reactions, particularly benzannulation [11], oxidation reaction [12], reduction of aromatic amine [13], C-C Ullman coupling reaction [14], Biginelli reaction [15], etc. Numerous studies have reported the synthesis protocols for AuNPs [16-20], out of those physical method microwave-based synthesis was one of the recent approaches for green synthesis [21,22]. In synthesis and assembly strategies of nanoparticles, precursors from liquids, solids or gas phase are used applying physical and chemical deposition approach [23]. The green synthesis of gold nanoparticles involves three main steps viz. selection of solvent medium, selection of environmental benign reducing agent and selection of the non-toxic substances [24,25]. Alzheimer’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Parkinson’s disease are common form of dementia. These dementias considered under tauopathy; it is a neurodegenerative diseases class caused by misfolding of the TAU protein. It is estimated that more than 45 million people worldwide are living with dementia and this number is expected to increase to more than 130 million people by 2050 [26]. Consequently, understanding the physiological and pathological roles of tau in health and disease is important to identify new therapeutic targets In present study, 1,3-dimethyl benzilydene barbituric acid derivatives were synthesized by using green and cost-effective gold nanoparticles fabricated from gold smith effluent as a low-cost and abundant source using autoclave microwave composite treatment to get uniform distribution of nanoparticles. D-glucose is used as the reducing reagent and starch as the capping reagent for gold nanoparticles synthesis. Furthermore, we checked the molecular docking study of barbituric acid derivative against TAU protein as an anti-alzheimer drug target.",472,28.pdf

In alkaline condition, glucose oxidizes itself by reducing gold solution in water. This reaction was performed in autoclave at 15 lb/inch pressure for 15 min at 121 ºC. Comparative gold nanoparticle synthesis was analyzed by observing the absorbance at 523 nm. Fig. 1 shows gold nanoparticles synthesis at various time duration. Increase in autoclave treatment time showed increase in absorbance at 523 nm. Maximum absorbance is observed at 15 min autoclave treatment time. Further increase in autoclave treatment time did not show significant increase in absorbance. SEM images confirmed the synthesis of nanoparticles (Fig. 2). After the successful synthesis of gold nanoparticles, we have proposed its application as a catalyst in Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 1,3-dimethyl barbituric acid, which having active methylene group with aromatic aldehyde that produce 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-barbituric acid. Owing to improve yield of resulted product of model reaction (Table-1). We optimized different reaction parameters like temperature, solvent and amount of catalyst. After evaluating efficiency of catalyst, we have also monitored the amount of catalyst in order to get maximum yield. Use of 0.4 mol % of catalyst gave high yield with less time. Selection of solvent and temperature is also important parameters of reaction. Where we have been found methanol was best solvent with respect to yield and reaction time and 100 ºC offer best results for the model reaction. With this optimized reaction conditions further, we have synthesized wide range of derivatives of 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-barbituric acid using structurally diverse aromatic aldehydes (Table-2). The recovery and reusability are major advantages of gold nanopaticles as heterogeneous catalyst after taking part in reaction. The catalyst was employed in reaction, washed with acetone and kept in the oven at 80 ºC. This regenerated activating catalyst results similar yield up to 4th cycle, which proved there is no further loss in its catalytic activity (Fig. 3). Molecular docking studies: Docking protocol was verified by docking with reference molecule donepezil in the vicinity of the same active site of TAU protein. Selected conformations were analyzed using Pymol and Discovery Studio softwares. All derivatives showed better binding affinity than existing reference octopamine (Table-3). Compound 3f molecule showed highest binding affinity with lowest energy -8.7 kcal/mol and compound 3b showed lowest binding affinity with energy -6.9 kcal/mol. ADME analysis was performed using Swiss ADME tool. ADME study predict that compounds 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f and 3g molecules will pass through central nervous system as all are not substrate of P-glycoprotein. It further predicts 3b, 3c and 3d will pass through blood brain barrier, but 3d molecule shows highest binding affinity with lowest energy -8.3 kcal/mol (Fig. 4). All the molecules showed maximum 55%, oral bioavailability, chemical stability at acidic pH less than 2, have good passive absorption (> 70%) against intestinal barrier with 100% passive absorption with trans-cellular route.

79,Genomics and Drug Research Approach in Identifying Potential Drug Target Highlighting Alzheimer Disease,2024,https://doi.org/10.52403/gijhsr.20240115,introduction,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a most common disease, predominately found in elder age group, which is a form of dementia caused by plaques and tangles. AD is considered as neurodegenerative disease that cause degeneration or loss of neurons in the brain and get shrunk. It is a serious problem which affects the ability to remember, imagine or learn. Nowadays every third person is facing this AD problems, which resulted our research objective to explore more on this disease, its type, causes, treatment and precautions. It depends on two factors, plaques (abnormal clusters of protein fragments) and tangles (made up of twisted strands of another protein). In a bi-lipid cell membrane APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) is present which helps in the growth and repair of neuron. APP is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the brain and metabolized in a rapid and highly complex manner by a series of sequential proteases, including the intramembranous γ-secretase complex, which process other key regulatory molecules. Half part of APP protein is inside the cell and half of it is present outside of the cell. Alpha secretase is a type of enzyme which cuts the APP protein at some particular points.[1] There is another enzyme known as gamma secretase which is also used to divide the APP protein into two parts. These sections were cut by the alpha and gamma secretase enzyme which are soluble in water that causes APP protein to be dissolved and new APP protein can be developed but when stimulation of beta secretase takes place it cannot be dissolved in water due to side cut which forms plaque. This plaque can obstruct the signals between neurons which produce inflammation leads to degeneration of neurons. Tau protein can be found in neurons and one of its key roles is to support the microtubule highway system. In AD, tau proteins changes and become abnormally hyperphosphorylated which stop supporting microtubules. Instead, the tau protein binds with other tau proteins, forming long protein threads within the neuron. These threads become protein tangles and interfere with the neuron’s ability to function. The proteolysis of APP protein by β- and γ-secretase activities [2] also incur with past research with identification of APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) which is the major β-secretase responsible for plaque formation in the brain. [3-6] BACE1 is present in most of body tissues including brain highlighted it as important enzyme protein used as a biomarker for AD.[7-9] With current advancement in bioinformatics and drug discovery research has opened new areas for exploring the treatment of AD with the help of system biology. In this research, we discovered target receptor BACE1 as potential drug target for AD, it inhibits Aβ production.[10] Bioactive compounds were extracted from plants which act as potent herbal medicine and helps to form a complex which can be used as drug for the treatment of AD. Further, docking studies were carried out in which BACE1 is best docked with chromen-4-one followed by some other bioactive compounds with positive potential result. To cross validate our docking research hypothesis we conducted computational based molecular dynamic (MD) simulation analysis to find potential drug compounds for futurist research.",526,29.pdf

Dysregulation of Sirt1 contributes to amyloid-beta accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation—hallmarks of AD pathology. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to develop small molecules that enhance Sirt1 activity, offering a novel therapeutic approach. By targeting Sirt1, these molecules can potentially mitigate AD progression, providing a promising strategy for developing effective treatments. In this present work, a pharmacophore containing six features has been designed using the Sirt1 macromolecule crystal structure using the Discovery Studio 2.0 software and validated by the Gunery-Henery (GH) Scoring method. The GH scores have been found in the acceptable range. Further, validated pharmacophores have been used for exploring the plant-derived database to retrieve the novel hits employing various parameters viz fit value, Lipinski rule of five violation, feature mapping, in silico pharmacokinetics and toxicological studies. After the virtual screening process, 24-24 molecules from the ZINC and FDA-approved database have been retrieved which have been further subjected to molecular docking to determine the binding interactions with the Sirt1 enzyme's active binding sites using the LibDock module in DS 2.0 software. Based on binding energy and binding interactions 2-2 molecules from the ZINC database and FDA-approved database have been selected for the molecular dynamic simulation.

82,Identification of Sirtuin 1-Targeted Anti-Alzheimer Agents Using Structure-Based Drug Design and Multi-Database Screening,2024,https://doi.org/10.56042/ijc.v63i12.13637,introduction,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive cognitive decline, memory impairment, and behavioural changes1,2. It is marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain3. Despite extensive research, there is still no cure for AD, and current treatments only offer limited symptomatic relief. Consequently, there is a pressing need for novel therapeutic approaches to address the disease's underlying causes and halt its progression4,5. Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) is a member of the Sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases and has garnered significant attention due to its involvement in regulating various cellular processes, including ageing, metabolism, and stress responses6. In the context of neurodegeneration, SIRT1 is particularly noteworthy for its potential neuroprotective effects7. SIRT1 exerts its beneficial effects by deacetylating and modulating the activity of several key proteins and transcription factors involved in neuronal survival, inflammation, and metabolic regulation. These properties make SIRT1 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in AD8. Research has demonstrated that SIRT1 activation can positively influence several pathological processes associated with AD 9. For instance, SIRT1 activation has been shown to reduce the production of Aβ peptides, one of the primary culprits in AD pathology10. This is achieved through the deacetylation and activation of retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ), which subsequently increases the expression of ADAM10, an enzyme that promotes the non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) 11. Additionally, SIRT1 can modulate tau pathology by deacetylating and stabilizing microtubules, thus reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. These findings suggest that SIRT1 activation could mitigate key pathological features of AD and confer neuroprotection11. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in modern medicinal chemistry that involves designing molecules with specific interactions based on the three-dimensional structure of a target protein12. The resolved crystal structure of SIRT1 provides critical insights into its active site and binding pockets, facilitating the design of small molecules that can specifically bind to and modulate SIRT1 activity13. This rational approach allows for the identification and optimization of compounds that enhance SIRT1 activity, offering a promising pathway for developing new therapeutic agents for AD. In the SBDD process, computational techniques such as molecular docking and virtual screening are employed to identify potential SIRT1 activators from extensive libraries of compounds13. These initial hits are then subject to medicinal chemistry efforts to optimize their binding affinity, specificity, and pharmacokinetic properties. The goal is to create molecules that are not only potent SIRT1 activators but also possess favourable characteristics for brain delivery and stability. We intended to find novel modulators using online available databases as prospective therapies targeted to SIRT1 in AD based on the views discussed above. By using the sirt1 structural protein with nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD) interaction as a template structure, we conducted in silico research that considered the construction of a receptor-based pharmacophore model for virtual screening. Following using the created pharmacophore model to virtually screen from the database, the obtained compounds were further filtered for their drug-likeness using Lipinski's Veber's and ADMET filters. An investigation was conducted to determine the binding relationship between the drug-like compounds that were obtained and the sirt1 structural protein with NAD domain pocket residues. In addition, the compounds that were acquired from docking research with the tubulin structural protein were put through significant molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine whether or not they remained stable for a period of fifty nanoseconds. In addition, the compounds that exhibited binding interactions with critical residues of the tubulin structural protein, which were comparable to those shown in the crystallographic structure of the sirt1 structural protein –NAD, were docked with the mutant structure that was produced.",605,31.pdf
83,Identification of Sirtuin 1-Targeted Anti-Alzheimer Agents Using Structure-Based Drug Design and Multi-Database Screening,2024,https://doi.org/10.56042/ijc.v63i12.13637,result,"Result and Discussion Generation and validation of receptor-ligand pharmacophore model Using Discovery Studio 2.0 software, six feature pharmacophore were developed which included two hydrogen bond acceptors, two hydrophobic and two hydrogen donors as shown in Fig. 1. This six-feature-based pharmacophore was validated using the Gunery Henery scoring method. The database included 90 decoy compounds and 13 inhibitors that were known to have sirt1. To assess the model's capability to differentiate between active and decoy compounds, the pharmacophore model was used as a 3D query to explore the internal decoy database. The following metrics were computed: total hits (Ht), active hits (Ha), percentage yield of actives, percentage ratio of actives, and GH score. A GH score between 0.7 - 0.8 implies a very commendable model. The observed value for the pharmacophore model was 0.752, as seen in Table 1. The verified findings demonstrate that the model was very effective for database screening. Drug-like compounds retrieved from virtual screening A highly reliable pharmacophore was employed to explore the test compounds database and 1,64,919 compounds from the Zinc database and 1,168 in the FDA-approved database were retrieved. Afterwards, using various filtration parameters including fit values, and feature mapping 167 and 1128 compounds were separated respectively. In addition, Ro5, veber's filters, and in silico pharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters also sorted the compounds (Table S1 and S2) and found 24-24 compounds from the ZINC and FDA-approved databases as shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Molecular docking Following the retrieval of compounds from the ZINC and FDA-approved databases, the molecular docking technique was used to investigate the binding interactions of the compounds that were recovered with the active binding sites of the Sirt1 enzyme domain. The efficiency of the AutoDock Vina technique was assessed before docking these compounds. This was accomplished by re-docking the co-crystallized ligand, NAD, into the Sirt1-binding pocket. Pyrx software was used for this evaluation. The purpose of this re-docking procedure is to act as a validation phase, which ensures that the docking algorithm properly reproduces the known binding mode of the co-crystallized ligand. This, in turn, confirms the dependability of the docking methodology for the following study of the flavonoid compounds. For this reason, we carried out docking of 24-24 compounds derived from ZINC and FDA-approved databases to evaluate the manner in which these compounds interact with the particular residues that are located in the catalytic site of the Sirt1 enzyme. All of the compounds that were retrieved were able to bind themselves to the Sirt1 enzyme with a high docking score, which was higher than the score for the reference compound. It was shown that these chemicals interact with the essential amino acid residues that are found in the Sirt1 protein. The amino acid residues Gln294, Phe297, Tyr280, His363, Gln345, Glu467, Asn465, Asp272, and Asp471 are shown in the Sirt1 crystal structure. For effective binding interactions, it is essential to have Phe273, Ala262, Ser441, Ser442, Arg466, Cys482, Phe414, Val266, and Arg274. The compounds that were recovered showed evidence of binding to the required amino acids, which indicates that they have the qualities needed to interact with the Sirt1 enzyme19,20. This is supported by Table 4, Table 5, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Molecular dynamic simulation MD simulation is used to explore the binding stability of protein-ligand docking complexes. The MD simulation also provides information regarding intermolecular interaction within a reference time. Herein, the complexes docking file of selected two NCI and two plant-based compounds with Sirt1 protein were analysed by utilising MD simulation approaches to confirm the stability and intermolecular interactions between protein and molecules against 100 ns time intervals21. In MD modelling, RMSD was evaluated between the initial and final simulated trajectories, and crucial features including binding interactions and conformation characteristics of the complex were also evaluated. For the enzyme-ligand complex (4i5i) involving ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide, the average RMSD values were found as 2.87, 3.08, 3.03 and 3.10 Å respectively as shown in Fig. 4. These values suggest efficient binding of the ligands with the sirt1 enzyme22,23. The lower RMSD values indicate a relatively stable and consistent binding of these ligands within the enzyme’s active site across the simulation time frame. Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), is an important feature that has to be considered when evaluating the structural flexibility of proteins during MD. In addition to assisting in the evaluation of the influence that ligand binding has on the stability of proteins, it offers knowledge on the fluctuations of certain amino acid residues. For this investigation, we compute RMSF values to investigate the fluctuations that occur within the protein residues when they are attached to ligands. The protein's structural stability might be disrupted if the RMSF value is more than three angstroms, which indicates that there is a possibility of higher amino acid fluctuations following ligand binding. On the other hand, a value of RMSF that is less than three angstroms indicates that there are fewer variations in amino acids, which indicates that the protein is more stable and resistant to structural alterations. The values of the RMSF for the complexes that were chosen for this investigation varied from 0.4 to 3 Å, which indicates that there were moderate variations in the amino acid residues. In terms of the ligands that the protein bound, the average RMSF values were as follows: 1.78, 1.49, 1.70, and 1.60 Å for ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide correspondingly as shown in Fig. 5. Collectively, these RMSF values provide an indication of the complexes' stability as well as their flexibility while the MD simulations were being performed. Compound ZINC000000864920 showed hydrogen bonding interactions with Tyr280, Arg282, Asp286, Gln294, Glu315, Gln345 and Asp348, hydrophobic interactions with Asp286, Glu315, Gln320, Asn346 and Asp348 amino acid residues with active binding active sites of sirt1 enzyme. Similarly, ZINC000096361333 showed hydrogen bonding interactions with Gly261, Ala262, Gly263, Ser266, Phe273, Tyr280, Gln294, Gln345, Asn346, His363, Phe414, Ser442 and Glu467; hydrophobic interactions with Arg274 and Lys444 amino acid residues of sirt1 macromolecules as shown in Fig. 6. Interestingly, Folic acid compound showed hydrogen bond interactions with Ala262, Gly263, Val266, Ser267, Arg274, Asp292, Gln294, Gln345, Gly440, Ser441, Ser442, Leu443, Lys444, Asn465, Arg466, Asp481 and Cyt482 and Bicalutamide showed hydrogen bond interactions with Ala262, Gly263, Val266, Asp272, Phe273, Arg274, Tyr280, His363, Val412, Gly440 and Asn465 amino acid residues of sirt1 active binding sites. Folic acid and Bicalutamide compounds also formed hydrophobic interactions with Ala262, Phe273, Phe297 and Phe414 amino acid residues of sir1 enzyme active binding cavities as shown in Fig. 6. Moreover, to evaluate the protein complexes to solvent molecules and their structural stability, several surface area measurements, such as SASA and rGyr, were analysed. The results revealed that the SASA values for ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide were 13282-14624 Å, 13575-15578 Å, 13523-14792 Å, and 13271-14791 Å, respectively. Additionally, the rGyr values for ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide were 20.09, 19.81, 19.9, and 22.85 Å, respectively. In the field of drug discovery research, the use of Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) techniques has resulted in the establishment of new standards for the identification of promising chemical compounds that target particular receptors. There is no denying the fact that CADD techniques make a major contribution to the improvement of the drug development pipeline. Through molecular docking, MM-GBSA calculations, and MD simulation investigations, it has been shown that the four compounds that have been offered have a promising affinity for Sirt1 20. At the same time, to evaluate the potential of these compounds against sirt1, multiple experimental verifications must be carried out. An efficient way to determine whether or not the molecules have a strong affinity for one another is the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) test. A kinetic study is an appropriate method to investigate the processes that are responsible for the binding and unbinding of these molecules. Based on the results of the experiments, more optimization of the molecules may be required to enhance their therapeutic potential and maximize their effectiveness.",1325,31.pdf

TREM2 regulates microglial states and functions such as phagocytosis. The most prominent TREM signaling adapter is DAP12, encoded by TYROBP. Understanding functional changes of this complex, and downstream effectors such as SHIP1, PLCG2 and the Scr family kinases Lyn and Hck, is required to evaluate a broad range of therapeutic hypotheses and drug targets for prioritization and enablement. The lack of available, well validated, and openly distributed experimental tools can limit early drug discovery efforts. Therefore, the IUSM Purdue TREAT-AD Center has generated and validated TREM2 activating antibodies to enable the advancement of drug targets in the TREM2/DAP12 signaling pathway. Method: To establish and validate anti-TREM2 agonist antibodies, heavy and light chain variable sequences were identified from multiple publications including patent applications. Antibodies were formatted as either human IgG1, Fc null mutant IgG1 or antibody transport vehicle (ATV) Fc null mutant IgG1. They were expressed in mammalian ExpiCHO cells and tested ex vivo for agonism based on their ability to activate AKT and Syk phosphorylation in THP1 cells and TREM2/DAP12 overexpressing cells respectively. The strongest agonistic candidate was scaled, purified, and further characterized biophysically and functionally. Result: Several agonistic antibodies were identified. AL2p31 antibody showed binding specificity to human versus murine TREM2. Biophysical characterization using biolayer interferometry showed that binding kinetic parameters (KD, Kon, and Koff) were not significantly affected in LALAPG null mutant Fc background. AL2p31 specifically induced Syk phosphorylation in comparison to an isotype control. Analysis of antibodies formatted as bispecific IgG1 targeting both TREM2 and the human transferrin receptor (hTfR), confirmed that RS9-F6 can bind both human and murine TREM2 and revealed the ATV 35-21-16 variant sequence as a binder for the hTfR. Conclusion: The mission of the IUSM Purdue TREAT-AD Center is to enable and advance the next generation of drug targets for the treatment of AD.
