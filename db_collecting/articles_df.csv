Amyloid β -protein (A β ) is reported to activate NLRP3 inﬂammasomes and drive
pyroptosis, which is subsequently involved in the pathogen esis of neurodegenerative
diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To date, the pat hogenesis of AD is
unfortunately insufﬁciently elucidated. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore
whether Salidroside (Sal) treatment could beneﬁt AD by impr oving pyroptosis. Firstly, two
animal models of AD, induced, respectively, by A β 1-42 and D-galactose (D-gal)/AlCl 3,
have been created to assist our appreciation of AD pathophys iology. We then
conﬁrmed that pyroptosis is related to the pathogenesis of A D, and Sal can slow the
progression of AD by inhibiting pyroptosis. Subsequently, we established the D-gal
and Nigericin-induced PC12 cells injury model in vitro to verify Sal blocks pyroptosis
mainly by targeting the NLRP3 inﬂammasome. For in vivo studies, we observed
that A β accumulation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, neurons of hippo campal damage,
and cognitive dysfunction in AD mice, caused by bilateral in jection of A β 1-42 into
the hippocampus and treatments with D-gal combine AlCl 3. Besides, accumulated
Aβ promotes NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation, which leads to the a ctivation and
release of a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β ). Notably, both A β
accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau decreased an d inhibited pyroptosis by
downregulating the expression of IL-1 β and IL-18, which can be attributed to the
treatment of Sal. We further found that Sal can reverse the in creased protein expression
of TLR4, MyD88, NF- κ B, P-NF-κ B, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved Caspase-1, cleaved GSDMD,
IL-1β , and IL-18 in vitro . The underlying mechanism may be through inhibiting
TLR4/NF-κ B/NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway. Our study highlight s the importance
of NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis in AD, and how the administration of
pharmacological doses of Sal can inhibit NLRP3 inﬂammasome -mediated pyroptosis
and ameliorate AD. Thus, we conclude that NLRP3 inﬂammasome -mediated pyroptosis
plays a signiﬁcant role in AD and Sal could be a therapeutic dr ug for AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerat ive
disorder characterized by memory loss and language
deterioration, and its incidence rate ranks ﬁrst globally
(
Alzheimer’s Association, 2021). The World Alzheimer Report
2021 reported that 50 million people worldwide have dementia.
Every 3 s, someone in the world develops dementia. It is
estimated that those suﬀering from dementia will grow from
55 to 139 million people during the period 2019–2050 (
World
Alzheimer Report 2021, 2021 ).
β -Amyloid (A β ) deposits, Tau proteins hyperphosphorylated,
and neuroinﬂammation are neuropathological hallmarks in AD
(
Emre et al., 2021 ). According to the hypothesis of A β , on
the one hand, the aggregation of A β can initiate a cascade of
reactions, including triggering hyperphosphorylation of Tau to
form neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinﬂammation, an d
neuronal degeneration, contributing to the onset of AD ( Zhou
and Fukushima, 2020 ). On the other hand, the activation
and proliferation of astrocytes and microglia caused by A β
accumulation ( Terrill-Usery et al., 2014 ) leads to the continuous
exposure of neurons to pro-inﬂammatory mediators and results
in neuronal dysfunction or death (
Heneka et al., 2014 ). Thus,
the vital pathological features of AD outlined above can caus e
diﬀerent degrees of neuronal loss and brain atrophy ( Zhuang
et al., 2019 ). Therefore, death neuronal is a root reason for AD
and other neurodegenerative diseases ( Hambright et al., 2017 ).
Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates pyroptosis may ser ve
as the predominant form of neuronal death in AD following
apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis (
Fricker et al., 2018; Shen
et al., 2021 ).
Pyroptosis is a programmed cell death mediated by
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) ( Shi et al., 2017 ), characterized by
swelling, rupture of the cell membrane, drive to release pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines, and intracellular contents, and th en
triggering the inﬂammatory response (
Yu et al., 2021 ). Pyroptosis
occurs when activated caspase-1 or caspase-4/5/11 cleaves th e
protein GSDMD, releasing the GSDMD-N subunit to form cell
membrane pores (
Kovacs and Miao, 2017 ), which has been
tightly linked to AD pathogenesis. Suppressed pyroptosis may
be a protective measure for neurons (
Zhao et al., 2019 ). Studies
have suggested that the inﬂammasome was involved in the onse t
of AD through triggering pyroptosis ( Dempsey et al., 2017 ).
Among all inﬂammasomes, including nod-like receptor protein
1 (NLRP1), nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), the nuclear
eﬀector protein 4 (NLRC4), and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2),
extensive studies have focused on the NLRP3 inﬂammasome.

NLRP3 inﬂammasome comprises three main components:
receptor protein NLRP3, the adaptor protein apoptosis-
associated speck-like protein (ASC), and the eﬀector protein
caspase-1 (
Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016 ). It is initiated by a
variety of stimuli, namely, microbial infection PAMPs (such
as viral DNA, microbes, and the components of the bacterial
cell wall) and DAMPs (such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
uric acid (UA) crystals, Aluminum adjuvant, and A β peptide)
(
Huang et al., 2021 ). Numerous research studies have examined
how NLRP3 inﬂammasome is involved in AD pathogenesis
through meditating pyroptosis. A study by
Daniels et al.
(2016) demonstrated that Fenamate NSAIDs improved the
microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation and memory loss in
3×TgAD mice by indirectly inhibiting the activation of NLRP3
inﬂammasome. Then,
Chiu et al. (2021) found that SG-Tang
could act as a neuroprotective agent against A β aggregation and
neuroinﬂammation by regulating the NLRP1/NLRP3 pathway.
Subsequently,
Kuwar et al. (2021) suggested that loaded A β can
be reduced signiﬁcantly, alleviate neuroinﬂammation, impr ove
hippocampal neuronal activity, and relieve cognitive functio n in
APP/PS1 mice via inhibiting NLRP3 inﬂammasome with JC124.
Even though limited studies have probed the role and underlyi ng
mechanism of NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis
in AD, the mechanisms of how NLRP3 inﬂammasome drive
pyroptosis need further study.
So far, clinical treatment of AD therapeutics has been
dominated by the use of western medicine, that is to say,
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, NMDA receptor
(NMDAR) antagonists, amyloid production or secretion
inhibitors, and inﬂammation inhibitors (
Orlov, 2019 ).
Nevertheless, these drugs only partially relieve symptoms
for a short time but cannot delay the progression of AD. To our
relief, recent studies have reported that phytopharmaceutica ls,
Salidroside can improve neuron impairments and cognitive
deﬁcits in AD (
Xie et al., 2020 ).
Rhodiola rosea L., a small genus of the Crassulaceae family,
has a long history of wide use as a botanical medicine in Europe,
Asia, and the US (
Zhong et al., 2018 ). With the continuous
development and improvement of scientiﬁc research technolog y,
many studies have examined the chemical constituents of
Rhodiola plants at home and abroad. The main pharmacological
active ingredients isolated from various Rhodiola are sali droside
and its aglycone (tyrosol), rosavin or rosavidine, pyridine , and
rhodiosin and rhodionin, etc (
Zhang et al., 2021 ). Among
them, Salidroside is widely studied. Sal (2-(4-hydroxyphen yl)
ethyl-β -D-glucopyranoside) ( Figure 2A) is a phenolic glycoside
compound that is the main active ingredient extracted from
Rhodiola Rose (
Fan et al., 2021 ). It has potent pharmacological
activities, mainly for preventing or treating disorders like
neurodegenerative diseases, cerebral ischemia, fatigue, hypoxia,
diabetes, and cancer (
Grech-Baran et al., 2015 ). Furthermore,
studies have demonstrated that Sal can eﬀectively reduce A β 1-
42 deposition and neuroinﬂammation in the brains of AD mice
(
Xie et al., 2020 ), improve cognitive decline during aging, and
thus exert neuronal protective eﬀects ( Jin et al., 2016 ). In their
study, Xing et al. (2020) found that Sal attenuated pyroptosis by
inhibiting caspase-1 activation, GSDMD cleaving, and reducin g

the interleukin-1 β (IL-1β ) release, ultimately reducing the form
of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, in PD-related studi es
Zhang X. et al. (2020) also demonstrated that Sal has a therapeutic
eﬀect on PD by inhibiting pyroptosis and thus dopamine neuron
death. All in all, the above studies consistently conclude th at Sal
plays a potential neuroprotective role by inhibiting pyroptosis .
Regrettably, the mechanism of how Sal protects neurons in AD
through inhibiting pyroptosis is incomplete and has not been
clariﬁed to date.
This study aimed to investigate the interaction between AD
and NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis via established
Aβ 1-42, D-gal/AlCl 3 mouse models in vivo , and a D-gal,
Nigericin treated PC12 cells damage model in vitro.

Animals
The present study uses male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) with
a bodyweight of 18–22 g, provided by the Nanjing Qinglongshan
Animal Cultivation Farm (Nanjing, China). Animals were rais ed
in an environment with constant temperatures (25 ± 2◦C),
light/dark cycles (12/12 h), and relative humidity (60 ± 10%).
During this period, the animal has free access to food and wate r.
Animals were provided with standard feeding and allowed wate r
and libitum.
All the animal procedures were performed according to the
3 R’s principle (Replacement, Reduction, and Reﬁnement) and
the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Bethesda,
MD, United States). The experimental protocols were approved
by the Animal Ethics Committee of the China Pharmaceutical
University. All eﬀorts were made to minimize the number of
animals used and the distress suﬀered.
Preparation of the A β 1-42 Oligomer
The Aβ 1-42 peptide was treated as previously described (
Xu et al.,
2021) to obtain A β oligomers. Brieﬂy, HFIP-treated A β 1-42 was
resuspended in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) when evaporating the
HFIP to form a peptide ﬁlm. Then, A β 1-42 was incubated at 37 ◦C
for 7 days, and stored at −80◦C (
Xiao et al., 2020 ).
Establishment of the AD Mice Model
The study ﬂow diagram for animal experiments is shown in
Figure 1. The experimental animal design was mainly divided
into two parts. Part I is to investigate the inﬂuence of Sal on t he
AD mice model induced by A β 1-42. Part II is to further explore
the potential mechanism of Sal on D-gal/AlCl 3-induced AD mice
and to inquire about the Sal action mechanism in pyroptosis.
Firstly, an Open-ﬁeld test and Morris water maze were performed
to test the behavioral performance of AD mice. Then, mice
were killed by cervical dislocation to collect hippocampal
tissues and collected for further histologic analysis, inc luding
Immunohistochemical staining, Enzyme Immunoassay Kit, an d
Western blotting analysis.
Aβ 1-42 Mice Model
As reviewed in other studies (
Fu et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020b ),
forty-eight male C57BL/6J mice were randomized into six gro ups
(n = 8): (1) control (DMSO Saline), (2) AD model (A β 1-42), (3)
positive control (A β 1-42+Donepezil (DNP), 1 mg/kg), (4) low-
dose (A β 1-42+Sal, 20 mg/kg), (5) middle-dose (A β 1-42+Sal, 40
mg/kg), and (6) high-dose (A β 1-42+Sal, 80 mg/kg) groups.
Mice were set on a stereotaxic apparatus after being
anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and
located in: Bregma = −2 mm, Sagittal suture = 1.5 mm, and Skull
= − 2 mm. The dura was exposed with the use of a skull drill to
drill. Subsequently, the micro-syringe was inserted into the left
and right hippocampus to inject A β 1-42 Oligomer, inject 5 µ l on
each side for 5 min, and keep 2 min to prevent reﬂux.
D-gal and AlCl3 Mice Model
According to relevant literature (
An et al., 2017; Liang et al.,
2018), the mice were randomly divided into six groups
(n = 10): (1) control (Saline + Pure water); (2) D-gal (150
mg/kg)/AlCl3(20 mg/kg); (3) D-gal/AlCl 3+DNP (1 mg/kg); (4)
D-gal/AlCl3+ Sal (20 mg/kg); (5) D-gal/AlCl 3+ Sal (40 mg/kg);
(6) D-gal/AlCl3+ Sal (80 mg/kg).
After treatment with Sal and DNP for 7 days, D-gal
(intraperitoneal injection, 150 mg/kg/d) and AlCl 3 (intragastric
administration, 20 mg/kg/d) were given in the experimental
group. By contrast, the Sal and DNP group were given not only
D-gal/AlCl3 but also treatment with Sal or DNP. The control
group was given pure water (intragastric administration) an d
intraperitoneal injection of Saline daily. Subsequently, t he Open-
ﬁeld test was used to test autonomous activities and explorati on
capabilities, and the Morris water maze evaluated the spatial
learning and memory ability after administration for 10 wee ks
(
Wang et al., 2019 ).
Behavioral Tests
Open-Field Test
The open-ﬁeld test is mainly used to exclude animal movement
obstacles, detect animal autonomous activities and explora tion
capabilities (
Kraeuter et al., 2019 ). The open-ﬁeld test box

comprises white wooden boards (40 × 40 × 45 cm) divided into
central and peripheral areas. The OFT was carried out in a quiet
environment, as described by
Sun et al. (2020a) . All mice were
adapted to the new experimental environment for 30 min before
the test began. The total distance and time traveled in the ope n
ﬁeld, and the total number of crossings in the central square were
recorded within 5 min. After each test, the feces was cleaned up
using 75% alcohol to eliminate any odor and avoid interferin g
with the exploration activities of other mice.
Morris Water Maze Test
The Morris water maze test was performed to assess learning and
memory ability (
Zhang et al., 2018 ). In this study, the MWM
was conducted in mice, as described by Wang W. Z. et al.
(2021). Mice were placed in a circular pool (120 cm diameter,
40 cm height) ﬁlled with milky white water at room temperature
(25◦C) with the escape platform (8 cm diameter) submerged
∼1 cm below the surface. A video-tracking system recorded the
animals’ movement. Mice were trained four times per day over
ﬁve consecutive days, and each trial lasted for 90 s.
In the place navigation test, mice were manually guided to
the platform stay continued 15 s, when they failed to search th e
platform in persistent 90 s. The phrase escape latency describes
the time it took the mice to ﬁnd the platform by themselves
and stay there for over 15 s. On the sixth day of the MWM, the
spatial probe test was conducted as follows. First, the mice we re
placed in the quadrant opposite the target quadrant without the
platform. Then, the number of times they crossed the platform
in the target quadrant within 90 s, travel time and distance i n the
target quadrant, and the route map of the search for the platfo rm
were recorded. Finally, data were analyzed by one-way ANONY .
Nissl Staining
Nissl staining was also performed as previously described (
Zhu
et al., 2020 ). First, the sections were dehydrated through graded
ethanol solutions (75, 85, 95, and 100%) and stained with 0.5%
cresyl violet (Beyotime, China). Next, excess cresyl viole t was
removed with PBS three times for 5 min then the slice was quick ly
dehydrated in 100% ethanol for 10 s. They were then covered wi th
a mounting medium. Finally, the slices were imaged using a lig ht
microscope (Nikon, Ts2R, Japan), and Image J software was used
to analyze them.
Cell Culture
Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were purchased by the
Chinese Academy Cell Resource Center (Shanghai, China). The
cells were grown in a medium containing 10% fetal bovine seru m
(FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µ g/mL streptomycin in an
incubator (Thermo Scientiﬁc) under 37 ◦C, 5% CO2. The medium
was replaced every 2–3 days. Cells under the logarithmic phase o f
culture were used for experiments. Furthermore, the cells wer e
planted at a speciﬁed density based on each experiment.
Cell Treatment
PC12 cells (2 × 10∧4 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates
and cultured for 24 h. Next, the PC12 cells were pre-treated wit h
Sal (2, 10, 50 µ M) for 2 h and then stimulated with D-gal (15
mg/ml) for 48 h. At last, all the cells were collected for analy ses.
PC12 cells (2 × 10∧4 cells/well) were planted into 6-well
plates and cultured for 24 h. Next, the PC12 cells were pre-treat ed
with NLRP3 agonist Nigericin (10 µ M) or Sal (50 µ M) for 2 h
and then treated with D-gal (15 mg/ml) for 48 h at 37 ◦C, 5%
CO2 incubator. Finally, the cells in all groups were collected for
subsequent analyses.

Cell Viability Assay
PC12 cells treatments were conducted in the 96-well plates,
following
Wang Y. et al. (2021) . Brieﬂy, PC12 cells were planted
into 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10∧4 cells per well
and incubated with D-gal (15 mg/ml) for 48 h in the presence
or absence of Sal (2, 10, 50 µ M), followed by the addition of
CCK-8 solution (Beyotime Biotechnology, Nantong, China) a nd
incubated for 1 h. Ultimately, the OD values of the cells at 450 nm
were monitored using a microplate reader, and the cell viabil ity
was calculated by the formula as follows: Cell viability (%) = (OD
[experiment]-OD [blank])/ (OD [control]-OD [blank]) × 100%.
SiRNA Transfection and Cell Viability Assay
PC12 cells were transfected with a speciﬁc NLRP3 siRNA
(100 nM) or non-binding control siRNA (100 nM) using a siRNA
kit (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufactur er’s
instructions. After transfection for 24 h, the cells were tr eated
with 50 µ M Sal for 24 h and exposed to D-gal or not. The cells
were collected for Western blotting analysis. The cell viab ility
was analyzed using a CCK-8 solution (Beyotime Biotechnolog y,
Nantong, China). The experiment details were performed
following the manufacturer’s instructions. All siNLRP3 sequences
are summarized in Supplementary Table S3.
Immunohistochemistry Staining
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was performed as
described in previous reports (
Chou and Yang, 2021 ), with
minor modiﬁcations. We collected the hippocampus of AD
mice to investigate the action of Sal on the protein of A β 1-
42, inﬂammatory-associated proteins (TLR4/NF- κ B), and
pyroptosis-associated proteins (NLRP3/Caspase-1). Brieﬂy,
the whole brains were dehydrated, followed by immersion
in paraﬃn, and subsequently, slices were cut. The sections
were dewaxed by xylene and hydrated in graded ethanol, then
micro-waved in sodium citrate buﬀer. Next, 3% hydrogen
peroxide was applied to block the endogenous peroxidase for
10 min. Then the slices were incubated with 5% fetal bovine
serum for 1 h at room temperature, before being treated with th e
primary antibodies A β 1-42 (Proteintech, 25524-1-AP , 1: 400),
p-Tau (Abcam, ab109390, 1: 200), NLRP3 (Abcam, ab263899, 1:
200), caspase-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, PA5-99390, 1: 200 ),
and TLR4 (Santa Cruz, sc-293072, 1: 50) at 4 ◦C overnight. The
sections were washed and incubated on the second day with the
goat anti-rabbit IgG (the ﬁrst four primary antibodies) and t he
goat anti-mouse IgG (the last primary antibodies) secondary
antibodies for 30 min. DAB chromogen reagent was used to
develop color with the slices. Lastly, we collected the imag es with
an inverted ﬂuorescent microscope (Nikon, Ts2R, Japan), and
Image J quantiﬁed the image.
Immunoﬂuorescence Staining
The immunoﬂuorescence was performed with some
modiﬁcations, following a previous description by
Zhao
et al. (2021) . In short, after Immunol Staining Fix Solution was
applied to ﬁx the PC12 cells for 30 min it was washed in PBS.
Then 0.2% Triton X-100 (9002-93-1, Sigma, USA) was added for
10 min. After being washed with PBS, cells were blocked with
5% BSA for 1 h. Subsequently, the slices were incubated with
rabbit anti-caspase-1 antibody (1: 400, PA5-99390, Invitro gen,
USA), rabbit anti-NLRP3 antibody (1: 200, ab263899, Abcam,
USA), and mouse anti-TLR4 (Santa Cruz, sc-293072, 1:50),
overnight at 4 ◦C. On the second day, PBS washed the slides
and then incubated them with the secondary antibody (1:400)
corresponding to the primary antibody in a dark room for
2 h at room temperature. PBS was washed again, and the 4 ′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, (Thermo Fisher, WLM, Mass,
United States) was applied to stain the cells for 5 min at room
temperature. Finally, the image was photographed by an inverte d
ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon, Ts2R, Japan) and analyzed by
Image J.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were
applied to determine the concentration of A β 1-42, IL-1 β , and
IL-18 in mouse brain and IL-1 β , IL-18 in PC12 cell supernatant,
following the manufacturer’s instructions (Elabscience, China).
Western Blot Analysis
The hippocampus tissue of AD mice was homogenated in
RIPA buﬀer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF).
Meanwhile, PC12 cells were lysed with lysis buﬀer containing
protease inhibitors. Firstly, the samples were centrifuged at
12,000 rpm/15 min at 4 ◦C. In turn, the protein content was
detected by the BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnolog y,
Nantong, China). Then, Western blotting was performed.
As mentioned by
Shi et al. (2021) , the procedures were as

and prepare the statistical charts. All data were graphed as the
mean ± SEM. Group diﬀerences in the escape latency during the
Morris water maze test were analyzed using the two-way analysi s
of variance (ANOV A). Other data were analyzed by one-way

the diﬀerence between each group. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Sal Improved A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3
Induced Cognitive Dysfunction in Mice
Open-Field Test
An open-ﬁeld test was used to observe the spontaneous
exploration activities of mice. As shown in Figure 2, compared
with the control group, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
the A β 1-42 group in the total distance ( Figure 2B), the average
velocity ( Figure 2D), and the intermediate region motion time
(Figure 2E), indicating that spontaneous exploration activities
defect of A β 1-42-mice group. Above all, the AD mice treatment
by Sal or DNP signiﬁcantly prolonged the intermediate region
motion time and total distance, increasing the average velo city
compared to A β 1-42-mice. The moving track of the mice in
the center and surrounding areas is exhibited in Figure 2C.
Thus, the results suggested that Sal can substantially improv e the
autonomous exploration activities of AD mice.
The athletic capacity and anxiety levels of the mice were
assessed by OFT (
Liu et al., 2021 ). In the OFT, the AD mice
induced by D-gal/AlCl3 had fewer total distances than the control
mice. The Sal or DNP group exhibited a total distance travele d
than the D-gal/AlCl 3 group ( Figure 2B). In terms of the time
spent in intermediate quadrant results, the D-gal/AlCl 3-mice
spent less time in intermediate quadrant than the normal mice
(Figure 2E). However, the time spent in the middle quadrant
was increased in the Sal or DNP group, compared with the D-
gal/AlCl3 group, and the diﬀerence had statistical signiﬁcance.
In addition, the average velocity of the D-gal/AlCl 3-mice was
lower than the control group ( Figure 2D). Conversely, the
average speed has signiﬁcantly increased in the Sal or DNP
group, compared to the D-gal/AlCl 3 group. Therefore, the result
suggested that Sal can improve athletic capacity and anxiety i n
AD mice.
Morris Water Maze
We assessed the learning and memory functions of the AD mice
by MWM. First, two-way ANOV A was conducted to analyze the
escape latency in the place navigation trial. The results show ed
that mice treated with A β 1-42 exhibited prolonged escape latency
compared to controls. In contrast, A β 1-42-mice with Sal or
DNP treatment show shorter escape latency than A β 1-42-mice
(Figure 3A). Second, during the spatial probe trial, the one-way
ANOV A result indicated that performance was generally worse
for the Aβ 1-42 group compared with the control group, including
a decrease of the number of platform crossings ( Figure 3B),
curtailing the time spent in the target quadrant ( Figure 3C),
and reduced the total distance traveled in the target quadra nt
(Figure 3D). Meanwhile, in this test, Sal and DNP groups where
Aβ 1-42 was co-administered with Sal or DNP were signiﬁcantly
better than the A β 1-42 group ( Figures 3B–D). Thus, the results
revealed that Sal could ameliorate the learning and memory
impairments induced by A β 1-42 in AD mice. The moving
track of A β 1-42 induced mice during the place navigation trial
(Figure 3E) and the spatial probe trial ( Figure 3F).
To investigate the eﬀect of Sal on the learning and memory
function of AD mice induced by D-gal/AlCl 3, we tested the mice
in a Morris Water Maze. This result is consistent with previous
reports (
Zhang et al., 2019 ). An increase in escape latency in AD
model mice was observed ( Figure 3A). In contrast, the escape
latency progressively shortened in the Sal or DNP group as tim e
went on. On the sixth day, the number of platform crossings,
the time spent in the target quadrant, total distance traveled in
the D-gal/AlCl3-induced AD mice decreased in the D-gal/AlCl 3-
mice when compared with the control group. Furthermore, the
above-mentioned behavior improved after treatment with Sal or
DNP (Figures 3B–D). These data suggest that Sal can ameliorate
the learning and memory function of D-gal/AlCl 3-induced AD
mice. The moving track of D-gal/AlCl3 induced mice during
the place navigation trial ( Figure 3E) and the spatial probe trial
(Figure 3F).
Sal Mitigated A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3
Induced Hippocampus Neuronal Injury in
Mice
The neuron is believed to play a vital role in learning and memo ry
functions. We, therefore, analyzed the number of neuronal i n
the CA1, CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus by Nissl
staining to investigate the eﬀects of Sal treatment on the neu ronal
morphology change. The neurons in the hippocampus area were
in a larger quantity, arranged in neat rows, and rich in Nissl
Bodies in the control group. In contrast, the neurons were
decreased in quantity, arranged in a disorderedly fashion, w ith
an obscure or disappeared karyopyknosis, or karyolysis, and poor
in Nissl Bodies in the A β 1-42 group ( Figure 4A). The Sal or
DNP-treated groups reversed the above pathological features ,
namely, the neurons were high in quantity, arranged neatly, with
more Nissl Bodies, little karyopyknosis, and karyolysis as se en
in Figure 4A. All in all, these data demonstrated that Sal could
attenuate its neuronal death.
To determine whether Sal protects the neurons from D-
gal/AlCl3-induced damage, we performed Nissl staining to
analyze the shape of neurons in the hippocampus of AD
mice. Nissl staining revealed that D-gal/AlCl 3-mice exhibited
neuronal pyknosis and signiﬁcantly reduced neuronal counts .
Conversely, in the Sal or DNP group, the above mentioned
pathological features were ameliorated, and the density of
neurons also increased signiﬁcantly ( Figure 4A). Together, these
results indicate that Sal ameliorated the damage of neurons
induced by D-gal/AlCl 3.
Sal Decreased A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3
Induced the Increased of A β 1-42 and P-Tau
in Mice
Aggregation of both A β and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein is
a primary hallmark of AD (
Bakota and Brandt, 2016 ). To explore
the eﬀect of Sal on A β 1-42-mice, we examined the expression
of A β and p-Tau in the brain of AD mice by Enzyme-linked
immunoassay kits (ELISA), Immunohistochemical staining, and

data indicates that the AD model was prepared successfully. In

lower compared with A β 1-42-mice ( Figure 4B), suggesting that

Sal treatment was not inferior to DNP. The expression of A β and
P-Tau protein was upregulated in the A β 1-42 group, as indicated
by western blotting while the presentation of A β 1-42, p-Tau
dropped in the DNP group. For comparison, this downregulate
tendency was more pronounced in the Sal group ( Figure 4C).
Furthermore, Immunohistochemical staining showed that A β
and p-Tau positive areas were signiﬁcantly increased in the
hippocampal region of the A β 1-42 group, with a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence compared with the regular group. Increased yellowish -
brown A β plaque deposition and brown P-Tau deposits in the
model group. Conversely, treatment with Sal or DNP marked
reduced the positive area of A β and P-Tau in the hippocampal
region, the yellowish-brown A β plaque deposition and brown
P-Tau deposits are both decreased, with a signiﬁcant diﬀerenc e
compared with the A β 1-42 group ( Figures 5A,B). In short, the
above results demonstrated that Sal could exert therapeutic
eﬀects on AD by directly reducing both deposition of the A β
peptide levels and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau.
To determine whether Sal treatment can decrease the A β
accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in D-gal/AlCl 3-
mice, we ﬁrst carried out analyses by ELISA kits. The results
indicated that the deposition of A β increased in the model group,
which implied that the AD model was established successfully.
Nevertheless, Sal, DNP groups all presented reductions in the
Aβ deposition compared with the D-gal/AlCl 3 group, meaning
Sal has similar eﬃcacy to DNP to exert therapy eﬀect on AD
(Figure 4B). Next, to further conﬁrm the impact of Sal on
the accumulation of A β and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in
AD mice, the relative expression levels of Tau, p-Tau, and A β
in the brain of AD mice were examined by Western blotting
(Figure 4C). The result demonstrated that the expressions of
p-Tau and A β were reduced in the Sal or DNP group, and
the statistical signiﬁcance of the diﬀerences for comparison D-
gal/AlCl3 group. Finally, IHC was performed. As shown in
Figures 5A,B, the yellowish-brown A β plaque deposition and
brown P-Tau deposits are both decreased in the Sal or DNP
group. In summary, these ﬁndings suggest that Sal can improve
the A β loaded and phosphorylation of Tau and subsequent
pathology of D-gal/AlCl 3-mice.
Sal Inhibited A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3
Induced Pyroptosis in Mice
In the present study, ELISA was used to evaluate the
inﬂammatory cytokines, namely, IL-1 β and IL-18. Based on the
ELISA results, the expression level of IL-1 β and IL-18 were
signiﬁcantly elevated in the brain of AD mice induced by A β 1-
42, suggesting that IL-1 β and IL-18 are cytokines that play
crucial roles in pyroptosis and the onset of AD. As Figure 6
shows, the A β 1-42-mice treat applied Sal, the expression of
IL-1β and IL-18 was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the A β 1-42
group ( Figures 6A,B). Subsequently, we further investigated the
expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, that is to say, IL-
1β , IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD by western blotting. Results
demonstrated that the protein level of IL-1 β , IL-18, and cleaved
GSDMD increased in the A β 1-42 group compared with the
regular group ( Figure 6C). In comparison, the Sal group found
a markedly reduced expression level of IL-1 β , IL-18, and
cleaved GSDMD. Notably, GSDMD-N was cleaved by activated
GSDMD, which could motivate the secretion of IL-1 β , IL-18,
and subsequently drive pyroptosis (
He et al., 2015 ). These results
imply that pyroptosis is closely related to AD, and Sal could
prevent pyroptosis in A β 1-42-induced AD mice.
GSDMD is a crucial biomarker of pyroptosis. To explore
the action and mechanism of Sal in pyroptosis, we assessed
both the IL-1 β and IL-18 and the expression of GSDMD
proteins related to the pyroptosis by ELISA kits and Western
blotting analysis. ELISA results indicated that treatment w ith
Sal gradually downregulated the secretion of IL-1 β and IL-18
induced by D-gal/AlCl 3 (Figures 6A,B). Western blot further
conﬁrmed our results. The result showed that the protein leve ls
of IL-1 β . IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD decreased in the Sal group
(Figure 6C). These results demonstrate that pyroptosis may
involve AD onset, and Sal could ameliorate the course of AD
through inhibited pyroptosis.
Sal Attenuated A β 1-42-Induced Pyroptosis
Through Modulation of the
NLRP3/Caspase-1 Signaling Pathways in
Mice
To explore Sal’s action and underlying mechanism in pyroptosis
induced by A β 1-42, we validated it using IHC and western
blotting. The western blotting results suggested that the
expression of the proteins of NLRP3, ASC and cleaved Caspase-
1 levels were increased in the A β 1-42-group ( Figure 7A),
the high expression of these proteins could be inhibited by
administration with Sal. Consistently, the IHC exhibited th at
the increased brown NLRP3, cleaved Caspase-1 deposits were
seen in the hippocampus of AD mice, and the brown deposits
were suppressed with Sal, which indicates Sal can inhibit
NLRP3/Caspase-1 ( Figures 8A,B). Thus, the above data show
that Sal can mitigate pyroptosis by inhibiting the NLRP3/caspase -
1 signaling pathway.

pyroptosis, and in turn, intervenes in the pathogenesis of AD,
we validated the results obtained from the A β 1-42 mice model
using the D-gal/AlCl 3 mice model. As expected, Western blotting
results showed an increase of TLR4, MyD88, p-NF- κ B, NLRP3,
ASC, and Cleaved Caspase-1 protein expression levels in the
model group. Conversely, these protein expressions were reduc ed
in the Sal group ( Figures 7A,B). Furthermore, the result of IHC is
consistent with A β 1-42-mice ( Figures 7C, 8A,B). Normal brain
tissue sections showed no signiﬁcant positive expression und er
high magniﬁcation and increased brown TLR4, NLRP3, cleaved
Caspase-1 deposits were seen in the hippocampus of AD mice,
and small amounts of brown deposits were seen in the Sal
groups. Thus, the above experiments veriﬁed that Sal inhibits
pyroptosis by suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF- κ B/NLRP3 and
NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway.
Sal Protected PC12 Cells Against
D-gal-Induced Cytotoxicity and Improved
Viability
To screen an optimum action concentration of D-gal, we ﬁrst
added D-gal (10, 15, 30, 40, 50 mg/ml) to 96-well culture plate s
and allowed it to act on the PC12 cells for 48 h. As Figure 9
shows, cell viability decreased with the increase of D-gal a ction
concentration, detected by the CCK8 assay ( Figure 9B). Finally,
D-gal (15 mg/ml), was selected as working concentrations fo r the
subsequent experiments.
To explore the action of Sal in D-gal induced cytotoxic and
neuroprotective eﬀects on PC12 cells, assays were performed
using a CCK-8 assay. As shown in Figure 9, after PC12 cells were
exposed to Sal (2, 10, 50 µ M) for 24 h, there were no signiﬁcant
hits for the viability of PC-12 cells ( Figure 9A), suggesting that
Sal did not alter the survival of PC12 cells. Subsequently, 2, 10,
and 50 µ M of Sal were added to the culture media, and cells were
pre-incubated for 2 h. Then, the cells were incubated with D-g al
(15 mg/ml) for 48 h, ﬁnally using CCK-8 for analyses. As shown
in Figure 9C, the percentage of PC12 cells was signiﬁcantly
increased in the Sal-treated group compared to the D-gal grou p.
The result implied that Sal might act to prevent PC12 cells
from damage.
Protective Effects of Sal Against PC12
Cells Damage Induced by D-gal via
Regulating TLR4/NF- κ B/NLRP3/Caspase-1
Signaling Pathway
To explore the underlying mechanisms of D-gal induced PC12
cells damage, ELISA was applied to determine the secretion
of IL-1 β and IL-18. Results indicated that Sal considerably
decreased the expression of IL-18 and IL-1 β in D-gal-induced
PC12 cells, suggesting that Sal can exert mitigated pyroptosi s
via the decreased release of inﬂammatory factors ( Figure 9E).
Meanwhile, Western blotting analysis was used to analyze the
TLR4-related and the NLRP3-related signaling pathway protein
to verify the above hypothesis further. Consistent results we re
obtained. Protein expression was downregulated in the Sal
group, including TLR4, MyD88, p-NF- κ B, NLRP3, ASC, Cleaved
Caspase-1, Cleaved GSDMD, IL-1 β , and IL-18 ( Figures 9F–H).
Furthermore, immunoﬂuorescence assays conﬁrmed that the
expression of TLR4, NLRP3, and cleaved Caspase-1 were
signiﬁcantly reduced by treatment with Sal ( Figure 9I). The
above result is consistent with the previous two AD mice model
results, indicating that Sal could suppress pyroptosis by inhibit ing
TLR4/MyD88/NF-κ B/NLRP3 and NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling
pathways in D-gal-induced PC-12 cells.
Effect of Sal on Nigericin-Induced NLRP3
Activation in PC12 Cells
CCK-8 assays were conducted to screen a suitable concentrat ion
of Nigericin for our experiment. The Nigericin concentratio n
chosen for this screening was 10 µ M (Figure 9D).
As demonstrated for A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 AD mice
models and PC12 cells model, pyroptosis plays a critical role
in the progression of various nervous system diseases (such
as AD, PD, HD, and ALS) (
Voet et al., 2019 ). In the present
experiment, we aimed to explore the mechanism of Sal during
the pathogenesis of AD. To further explore the action of Sal on
NLRP3 activation, Western blotting was used to assess changes in
NLRP3 and its downstream proteins in Nigericin + Sal-treated
PC12 cells. As indicated in the ﬁgure, the level of NLRP3 and
its downstream proteins was noticeably increased in the D-ga l
group compared to the normal group. By contrast, the level
of NLRP3 was decreased in the Sal group compared with the
D-gal group. Interestingly, compared with the Sal group, the
Nigericin group eﬃciently reversed the reduced level of NLRP 3
eﬀectively while increasing the level of ASC, cleaved Caspase-
1, cleaved GSDMD, IL-1 β , and IL-18, a downstream target of
NLRP3 ( Figure 9J). Thus, the above results conﬁrmed that Sal
inhibited pyroptosis mainly through targeting suppression of t he
NLRP3 inﬂammasome.
NLRP3 Is Involved in the Inhibitory Effect of
Sal on D-gal-Induced PC12 Cells
Pyroptosis
We hypothesized that Sal acts against D-gal-induced NLRP3
inﬂammasome activation by downregulating NLRP3. To test
this, we knocked down NLRP3 expression in PC12 cells by
siRNA. Firstly, the Western blot result showed that the sequen ce
1 of NLRP3 siRNA had a better eﬀect in silencing NLRP3
(Figure 10A). As shown in Figure 10B, we found that the

NLRP3 siRNA group or Salidroside signiﬁcantly reversed D-
gal induces upregulation of cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-

mediated pyroptosis plays a central role in AD. At the same
time, compared with the NLRP3 siRNA group, the Salidroside
combined NLRP3 siRNA group failed to change the protein
expression of cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1 β , and IL-18 in
PC12 cells ( Figure 10B). Moreover, NLRP3 siRNA or Salidroside
rescued in cell viability induced by D-gal, and the Salidros ide
combined NLRP3 siRNA group failed to change cell viability
compared with NLRP3 siRNA ( Figure 10C). Collectively, the
above data demonstrate that Salidroside inhibited pyroptosi s by
targeting the NLRP3 inﬂammasome.
DISCUSSION
AD is the most common cause of dementia and the ﬁfth-
largest cause of death globally (
Cortes-Canteli and Iadecola,
2020). Presently, the most signiﬁcant number of AD patients in
the world are in China. It is therefore vital that the potentia l
pathogenesis of AD is elucidated and potential therapeutic
drugs are developed. Previous studies have elucidated that
the pathogenesis of AD may be related to abnormal A β
deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation, cholinergic hypothesis ,
and inﬂammatory response (
Sharma et al., 2019 ). Nonetheless,
the precise mechanism of AD remains ambiguous. Recent
studies have proposed that pyroptosis can trigger AD, leading to
brain lesions and further lured synaptic dysfunction, neuro nal
degeneration, and memory impairment (
El-Sisi et al., 2021 ).
The present study was designed to verify whether: (1) the
NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis contributes to the
pathogenesis of AD; and (2) to examine if Sal can prevent
neurons from damage in A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3-induced AD
mouse models and D-gal-treated PC12 cell models through
inhibited NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis.
To gain insight into AD etiopathogenesis, we established
AD models in vivo and in vitro to ﬁnd the link between
AD and pyroptosis. Related researches have shown that
intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of A β 1-42 peptide can
mimic some of the symptoms of AD, including memory
impairment, oxidative stress, and neuroinﬂammation (
Fu et al.,
2019). Based on this, we established an AD model by injecting
Aβ 1-42 into the bilateral hippocampus, as other articles ( Chen
et al., 2021 ) have outlined. The results were in line with prior
research ( Li et al., 2018 ) ﬁndings for AD mice treated by
Sal, which exhibited reduced escape latency. The number of
crossings and time spent in the target quadrant was increased
and signiﬁcantly reversed A β 1-42-induced cognitive impairment
in AD mice. Consistent with previous studies (
Bassil et al., 2020 ),
our study indicates that A β and p-Tau positive areas increased
in AD mice induced by A β 1-42. The treatment eﬀects of Sal
were consistent with DNP , where both A β and p-Tau positive
areas were reduced, hinting that Sal can play a therapeutic rol e
in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, the number of neurons in the
hippocampus’s CA1, CA3, and DG regions were reduced when
injected with A β 1-42, which is caused by accumulated A β peptide
activating the NLRP3 inﬂammasome and triggering pyroptosis.
As described in a previous study (
Dempsey et al., 2017 ), A β
accumulates in the AD brain to form characteristic plaques
and then activates the NLRP3 inﬂammasome, triggering the
pyroptosis via the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway,
and ﬁnally leading to levels of inﬂammatory factors IL-1 β and IL-
18 becoming elevated. Our result indicates that Sal signiﬁc antly
oﬀset the increase of IL-1 β and IL-18 expression induced by A β 1-
42 and inhibited the expression of the pyroptosis-related protein ,
namely, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved Caspase-1, cleaved GSDMD,
IL-1β , and IL-18, its mechanism may act by inhibiting the
NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathway.
This AD model induced by A β 1-42 with bilateral hippocampal
injection was a short-term model that articulates AD’s
pathogenesis only from the amyloid hypothesis, meaning it
has some limitations. Therefore, to ensure the reliability of
the eﬃcacy of Sal, as outlined in previous research (
Zhang W.
et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021 ), D-gal/AlCl 3 was used to establish a
long-term AD mice model. Meanwhile, the D-gal-induced PC12
cell damage model was established, further validating Sal’ s role in
AD and the exact mechanism of action.
D-gal is a drug that can induce immune system defects,
oxidative stress damage, and neurochemical changes, and th ese
neurochemical changes are similar to normal aging in animals
(
Wang J. et al., 2017 ). The metabolite in the brain of high-level
D-gal was Galactose, and its accumulation in neurons may res ult
in a destroyed balance of cell osmotic pressure and changed
cell morphology, loss of neurons, and even AD occurs (
Wei
et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, it is known that Al is a neurotoxic
agent, and long-term exposure to Al can cause severe damage
to hippocampal cell structures, leading to the development of
neurodegenerative diseases (
Abd-Elhady et al., 2013 ). The AD
mice model induced by D-gal/AlCl 3 replicates the whole aging
process and triggers AD-like symptoms, including cognitive and
memory defects, excessive amyloid protein expression, oxida tive

damage, and inﬂammation ( Zhang W. et al., 2020 ). PC12 was
classiﬁed as the adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line, widely used
to study the pathogenesis and progression of various neurolog ical
diseases, such as AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD), epilepsy, and
ischemia (
Thiel et al., 2015; Loeﬄer et al., 2016; Ivashko-Pachima
and Gozes, 2018; Lahiani et al., 2018 ). Thence, to build a model
closer to a human AD model, we established an AD mouse
model induced by D-gal/AlCl 3. Besides, the D-gal-induced PC12
cell injury model was established to further elucidate role s for
pyroptosis in AD pathogenesis.
As is well-known to us, D-gal combined with AlCl 3 can
induce A β accumulation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and
neuroinﬂammatory responses (
Chiroma et al., 2019 ), leading
to the increased expression of inﬂammatory factors IL-1 β and
IL-18. A β was intracerebral DAMP that can be recognized
by microglia surface PRRs, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like
receptors (NLRs), RAGE, and SRs, activated downstream signal
transduction pathways produce eﬀects (
Salminen et al., 2009 ).
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was a pattern recognition receptor
(PRR) expressed mainly on the surface of microglia ( Liu Y.
et al., 2020 ), associated with the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and
ischemia-reperfusion diseases. TLR4 activation leads to its
downstream recruitment via the upstream adaptor molecule
myeloid diﬀerentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) to activate
NF-κ B and increase levels of several pro-inﬂammatory factors
such as IL-1 β and TNF- α (
Liu M. et al., 2020 ). Activated
NF-κ B translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and
then promotes the secretion of IL-1 β and IL-18, which are
crucial to regulating pyroptosis ( Liu et al., 2017 ). Meanwhile,
multiple studies have shown that NF- κ B is an essential
upstream activator of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome, triggering the
initiation and assembly of inﬂammasome through induction
of NLRP3 expression and promoting the inﬂammatory
cascade response (
Guo et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2020 ). The
assembly of NLRP3 inﬂammasome activated caspase-1, which
further drives the cleavage of GSDMD, generated N-terminal
fragments, and then induced membrane pore formation,
promoted the release of IL-1 β and IL-18, and ﬁnally leads to
FIGURE 11 | Sal ameliorates AD by suppressing NLRP3-mediated pyroptos is. The primary mechanism is described below: (1) Sal direct ly reducing the accumulation
of A β , thus inhibited pyroptosis by blocking the NLRP3 inﬂammasom e activation, mainly through inhibiting NLRP3/caspase-1 si gnaling pathways; (2) Sal indirectly
suppressed pyroptosis through inhibiting TLR4, the mechan ism may via TLR4/NF- κ B/NLRP3 signaling pathways. These results exhibited that in hibiting pyroptosis
through treatment by Sal could be a new approach in the therap eutic treatment of AD.
Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 19 January 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 809433 Cai et al. Salidroside Ameliorates AD by Inhibiting Pyroptosis
pyroptosis ( Kesavardhana and Kanneganti, 2017 ). Our results
demonstrate that D-gal/AlCl 3-mice after Sal treatment had
signiﬁcantly improved learning and memory dysfunction,
reduced A β accumulation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and
downregulated IL-1 β and IL-18 expression. This result
was consistent with the A β 1-42 model mice. Sal has anti-
inﬂammatory and anti-pyroptosis eﬀects in neurodegenerative
diseases (
Wang C. et al., 2017; Zhang X. et al., 2020 ). Here,
we demonstrated that Sal could improve neurodegeneration
induced by D-gal/AlCl 3. Its primary mechanism is inhibiting
TLR4/MyD88/NF-κ B/NLRP3. All studies were combined, the
eﬃcacy of Sal is: (1) that it directly prevents the activation of
the NLRP3 inﬂammasome by suppressing the accumulation
of A β ; and (2), that it downregulated the expression of
inﬂammatory-related proteins, to indirectly inhibit NLRP3
inﬂammasome-dependent pyroptosis.
To further determine whether Sal inhibited pyroptosis by
targeted NLRP3 inﬂammasome, we established a Nigericin-
induced PC12 cell impairment model. It has been reported
that Nigericin was an NLRP3 activator, which can reverse
Metformin’s protective eﬀect and thereby increase the release
of pro-inﬂammatory factors (
Zhang J. et al., 2020 ). Our study
agrees with the above studies. In Nigericin and D-gal group,
the increased expression level of NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved
Caspase-1 was detected in the culture supernatant of PC12
cells, and a corresponding increase in the expression of the
NLRP3 downstream proteins cleaved GSDMD, the release of
pro-inﬂammatory factors IL-1 β and IL-18 increased, which
suggests that Nigericin activated NLRP3 inﬂammasome. By
contrast, the expression of NLRP3 and its downstream proteins
was signiﬁcantly reduced in the Sal group of cells without
Nigericin stimulation. Consequently, the above experiment
further validated that Sal inhibited pyroptosis by the target ed
NLRP3 inﬂammasome.
In summary, this study expands knowledge on the
relationship between NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated
pyroptosis and AD. The above data revealed that the eﬃcacy of
Sal was similar to DNP , and has a prominent preventive eﬀect in
the pathogenesis of AD. It eﬀectively alleviated A β aggregation,
Tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinﬂammation, and pyroptosis.
Although DNP displays a neuroprotective eﬀect and is widely
used in treating AD, multiple studies have illustrated that
it causes adverse eﬀects, including hostility, somnolence,
fecal incontinence, nausea, and rhinitis (
Adlimoghaddam
et al., 2018 ). Consequently, Sal may be a potential candidate
for the treatment of AD through inhibiting the NLRP3
inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis.
CONCLUSION
The present study revealed that activation of NLRP3
inﬂammasomes is a crucial target for pyroptosis induced
by A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3. Thus, if treated with Sal, signiﬁcant
pathological improvement of AD could potentially be achieved
by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inﬂammasome and the
release of a pro-inﬂammatory factor downstream of NLRP3
and thus inhibiting pyroptosis. Its potential mechanism may act
directly through the inhibited NLRP3/Caspase-1 or indirectl y via
the suppressed TLR4/NF- κ B/NLRP3/Caspase-1 signal pathway.
The speciﬁc mechanism is shown in Figure 11. These ﬁndings
provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the
pathogenesis of AD and a unique perspective on the prevention
and cure of the disease.

Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 22 January 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 809433 ","Salidroside a natural compound has been shown to exert protective effects against cognitive dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. It functions by inhibiting pyroptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation. The mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects involve activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. Studies have demonstrated that salidroside can improve memory impairment, reduce tau hyperphosphorylation, alleviate neuroinflammation and mitigate cognitive dysfunctions in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Future research should focus on exploring the potential clinical applications of salidroside for treating neurodegenerative disorders.","Amyloid β -protein (A β ) is reported to activate NLRP3 inﬂammasomes and drive pyroptosis, which is subsequently involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To date, the pathogenesis of AD is unfortunately insufﬁciently elucidated. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore whether Salidroside (Sal) treatment could beneﬁt AD by improving pyroptosis. Firstly, two animal models of AD, induced, respectively, by A β 1-42 and D-galactose (D-gal)/AlCl 3, have been created to assist our appreciation of AD pathophysiology. We then conﬁrmed that pyroptosis is related to the pathogenesis of AD, and Sal can slow the progression of AD by inhibiting pyroptosis. Subsequently, we established the D-gal and Nigericin-induced PC12 cells injury model in vitro to verify Sal blocks pyroptosis mainly by targeting the NLRP3 inﬂammasome. For in vivo studies, we observed that A β accumulation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, neurons of hippocampal damage, and cognitive dysfunction in AD mice, caused by bilateral injection of A β 1-42 into the hippocampus and treatments with D-gal combine AlCl 3. Besides, accumulated Aβ promotes NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation, which leads to the activation and release of a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β ). Notably, both A β accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau decreased and inhibited pyroptosis by downregulating the expression of IL-1 β and IL-18, which can be attributed to the treatment of Sal. We further found that Sal can reverse the increased protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF- κ B, P-NF-κ B, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved Caspase-1, cleaved GSDMD, IL-1β , and IL-18 in vitro . The underlying mechanism may be through inhibiting TLR4/NF-κ B/NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway. Our study highlights the importance of NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis in AD, and how the administration of pharmacological doses of Sal can inhibit NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis and ameliorate AD. Thus, we conclude that NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis plays a signiﬁcant role in AD and Sal could be a therapeutic drug for AD.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and language deterioration, and its incidence rate ranks ﬁrst globally (Alzheimer’s Association, 2021). The World Alzheimer Report 2021 reported that 50 million people worldwide have dementia. Every 3 s, someone in the world develops dementia. It is estimated that those suﬀering from dementia will grow from 55 to 139 million people during the period 2019–2050 (World Alzheimer Report 2021, 2021). β -Amyloid (A β ) deposits, Tau proteins hyperphosphorylated, and neuroinﬂammation are neuropathological hallmarks in AD (Emre et al., 2021). According to the hypothesis of A β , on the one hand, the aggregation of A β can initiate a cascade of reactions, including triggering hyperphosphorylation of Tau to form neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinﬂammation, and neuronal degeneration, contributing to the onset of AD (Zhou and Fukushima, 2020). On the other hand, the activation and proliferation of astrocytes and microglia caused by A β accumulation (Terrill-Usery et al., 2014) leads to the continuous exposure of neurons to pro-inﬂammatory mediators and results in neuronal dysfunction or death (Heneka et al., 2014). Thus, the vital pathological features of AD outlined above can cause diﬀerent degrees of neuronal loss and brain atrophy (Zhuang et al., 2019). Therefore, death neuronal is a root reason for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases (Hambright et al., 2017). Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates pyroptosis may serve as the predominant form of neuronal death in AD following apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis (Fricker et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2021). Pyroptosis is a programmed cell death mediated by Gasdermin D (GSDMD) (Shi et al., 2017), characterized by swelling, rupture of the cell membrane, drive to release pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, and intracellular contents, and then triggering the inﬂammatory response (Yu et al., 2021). Pyroptosis occurs when activated caspase-1 or caspase-4/5/11 cleaves the protein GSDMD, releasing the GSDMD-N subunit to form cell membrane pores (Kovacs and Miao, 2017), which has been tightly linked to AD pathogenesis. Suppressed pyroptosis may be a protective measure for neurons (Zhao et al., 2019). Studies have suggested that the inﬂammasome was involved in the onset of AD through triggering pyroptosis (Dempsey et al., 2017). Among all inﬂammasomes, including nod-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1), nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), the nuclear eﬀector protein 4 (NLRC4), and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), extensive studies have focused on the NLRP3 inﬂammasome. NLRP3 inﬂammasome comprises three main components: receptor protein NLRP3, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and the eﬀector protein caspase-1 (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016). It is initiated by a variety of stimuli, namely, microbial infection PAMPs (such as viral DNA, microbes, and the components of the bacterial cell wall) and DAMPs (such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), uric acid (UA) crystals, Aluminum adjuvant, and A β peptide) (Huang et al., 2021). Numerous research studies have examined how NLRP3 inﬂammasome is involved in AD pathogenesis through mediating pyroptosis. A study by Daniels et al. (2016) demonstrated that Fenamate NSAIDs improved the microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation and memory loss in 3×TgAD mice by indirectly inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inﬂammasome. Then, Chiu et al. (2021) found that SG-Tang could act as a neuroprotective agent against A β aggregation and neuroinﬂammation by regulating the NLRP1/NLRP3 pathway. Subsequently, Kuwar et al. (2021) suggested that loaded A β can be reduced signiﬁcantly, alleviate neuroinﬂammation, improve hippocampal neuronal activity, and relieve cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice via inhibiting NLRP3 inﬂammasome with JC124. Even though limited studies have probed the role and underlying mechanism of NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis in AD, the mechanisms of how NLRP3 inﬂammasome drive pyroptosis need further study. So far, clinical treatment of AD therapeutics has been dominated by the use of western medicine, that is to say, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, amyloid production or secretion inhibitors, and inﬂammation inhibitors (Orlov, 2019). Nevertheless, these drugs only partially relieve symptoms for a short time but cannot delay the progression of AD. To our relief, recent studies have reported that phytopharmaceutica ls, Salidroside can improve neuron impairments and cognitive deﬁcits in AD (Xie et al., 2020). Rhodiola rosea L., a small genus of the Crassulaceae family, has a long history of wide use as a botanical medicine in Europe, Asia, and the US (Zhong et al., 2018). With the continuous development and improvement of scientiﬁc research technology, many studies have examined the chemical constituents of Rhodiola plants at home and abroad. The main pharmacological active ingredients isolated from various Rhodiola are salidroside and its aglycone (tyrosol), rosavin or rosavidine, pyridine, and rhodiosin and rhodionin, etc (Zhang et al., 2021). Among them, Salidroside is widely studied. Sal (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl-β -D-glucopyranoside) (Figure 2A) is a phenolic glycoside compound that is the main active ingredient extracted from Rhodiola Rose (Fan et al., 2021). It has potent pharmacological activities, mainly for preventing or treating disorders like neurodegenerative diseases, cerebral ischemia, fatigue, hypoxia, diabetes, and cancer (Grech-Baran et al., 2015). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that Sal can eﬀectively reduce A β 1-42 deposition and neuroinﬂammation in the brains of AD mice (Xie et al., 2020), improve cognitive decline during aging, and thus exert neuronal protective eﬀects (Jin et al., 2016). In their study, Xing et al. (2020) found that Sal attenuated pyroptosis by inhibiting caspase-1 activation, GSDMD cleaving, and reducing the interleukin-1 β (IL-1β ) release, ultimately reducing the form of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, in PD-related studies Zhang X. et al. (2020) also demonstrated that Sal has a therapeutic eﬀect on PD by inhibiting pyroptosis and thus dopamine neuron death. All in all, the above studies consistently conclude that Sal plays a potential neuroprotective role by inhibiting pyroptosis. Regrettably, the mechanism of how Sal protects neurons in AD through inhibiting pyroptosis is incomplete and has not been clariﬁed to date. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between AD and NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis via established Aβ 1-42, D-gal/AlCl 3 mouse models in vivo, and a D-gal, Nigericin treated PC12 cells damage model in vitro.","Sal Improved A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 Induced Cognitive Dysfunction in Mice Open-Field Test An open-ﬁeld test was used to observe the spontaneous exploration activities of mice. As shown in Figure 2, compared with the control group, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the A β 1-42 group in the total distance (Figure 2B), the average velocity (Figure 2D), and the intermediate region motion time (Figure 2E), indicating that spontaneous exploration activities defect of A β 1-42-mice group. Above all, the AD mice treatment by Sal or DNP signiﬁcantly prolonged the intermediate region motion time and total distance, increasing the average velocity compared to A β 1-42-mice. The moving track of the mice in the center and surrounding areas is exhibited in Figure 2C. Thus, the results suggested that Sal can substantially improve the autonomous exploration activities of AD mice. The athletic capacity and anxiety levels of the mice were assessed by OFT (Liu et al., 2021). In the OFT, the AD mice induced by D-gal/AlCl3 had fewer total distances than the control mice. The Sal or DNP group exhibited a total distance traveled than the D-gal/AlCl 3 group (Figure 2B). In terms of the time spent in intermediate quadrant results, the D-gal/AlCl 3-mice spent less time in intermediate quadrant than the normal mice (Figure 2E). However, the time spent in the middle quadrant was increased in the Sal or DNP group, compared with the D-gal/AlCl3 group, and the diﬀerence had statistical signiﬁcance. In addition, the average velocity of the D-gal/AlCl 3-mice was lower than the control group (Figure 2D). Conversely, the average speed has signiﬁcantly increased in the Sal or DNP group, compared to the D-gal/AlCl 3 group. Therefore, the result suggested that Sal can improve athletic capacity and anxiety in AD mice. Morris Water Maze We assessed the learning and memory functions of the AD mice by MWM. First, two-way ANOV A was conducted to analyze the escape latency in the place navigation trial. The results showed that mice treated with A β 1-42 exhibited prolonged escape latency compared to controls. In contrast, A β 1-42-mice with Sal or DNP treatment show shorter escape latency than A β 1-42-mice (Figure 3A). Second, during the spatial probe trial, the one-way ANOV A result indicated that performance was generally worse for the Aβ 1-42 group compared with the control group, including a decrease of the number of platform crossings (Figure 3B), curtailing the time spent in the target quadrant (Figure 3C), and reduced the total distance traveled in the target quadrant (Figure 3D). Meanwhile, in this test, Sal and DNP groups where Aβ 1-42 was co-administered with Sal or DNP were signiﬁcantly better than the A β 1-42 group (Figures 3B–D). Thus, the results revealed that Sal could ameliorate the learning and memory impairments induced by A β 1-42 in AD mice. The moving track of A β 1-42 induced mice during the place navigation trial (Figure 3E) and the spatial probe trial (Figure 3F). To investigate the eﬀect of Sal on the learning and memory function of AD mice induced by D-gal/AlCl 3, we tested the mice in a Morris Water Maze. This result is consistent with previous reports (Zhang et al., 2019). An increase in escape latency in AD model mice was observed (Figure 3A). In contrast, the escape latency progressively shortened in the Sal or DNP group as time went on. On the sixth day, the number of platform crossings, the time spent in the target quadrant, total distance traveled in the D-gal/AlCl3-induced AD mice decreased in the D-gal/AlCl 3-mice when compared with the control group. Furthermore, the above-mentioned behavior improved after treatment with Sal or DNP (Figures 3B–D). These data suggest that Sal can ameliorate the learning and memory function of D-gal/AlCl 3-induced AD mice. The moving track of D-gal/AlCl3 induced mice during the place navigation trial (Figure 3E) and the spatial probe trial (Figure 3F). Sal Mitigated A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 Induced Hippocampus Neuronal Injury in Mice The neuron is believed to play a vital role in learning and memory functions. We, therefore, analyzed the number of neurons in the CA1, CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus by Nissl staining to investigate the eﬀects of Sal treatment on the neuronal morphology change. The neurons in the hippocampus area were in a larger quantity, arranged in neat rows, and rich in Nissl Bodies in the control group. In contrast, the neurons were decreased in quantity, arranged in a disorderedly fashion, with an obscure or disappeared karyopyknosis, or karyolysis, and poor in Nissl Bodies in the A β 1-42 group (Figure 4A). The Sal or DNP-treated groups reversed the above pathological features, namely, the neurons were high in quantity, arranged neatly, with more Nissl Bodies, little karyopyknosis, and karyolysis as seen in Figure 4A. All in all, these data demonstrated that Sal could attenuate its neuronal death. To determine whether Sal protects the neurons from D-gal/AlCl3-induced damage, we performed Nissl staining to analyze the shape of neurons in the hippocampus of AD mice. Nissl staining revealed that D-gal/AlCl 3-mice exhibited neuronal pyknosis and signiﬁcantly reduced neuronal counts. Conversely, in the Sal or DNP group, the above mentioned pathological features were ameliorated, and the density of neurons also increased signiﬁcantly (Figure 4A). Together, these results indicate that Sal ameliorated the damage of neurons induced by D-gal/AlCl 3. Sal Decreased A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 Induced the Increased of A β 1-42 and P-Tau in Mice Aggregation of both A β and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein is a primary hallmark of AD (Bakota and Brandt, 2016). To explore the eﬀect of Sal on A β 1-42-mice, we examined the expression of A β and p-Tau in the brain of AD mice by Enzyme-linked immunoassay kits (ELISA), Immunohistochemical staining, and Western blotting analysis. Figures 4, 5 exhibit that the level of Aβ was signiﬁcantly increased for the A β 1-42-mice compared with the regular group, as measured by the ELISA kit. This data indicates that the AD model was prepared successfully. In addition, the levels of A β 1-42 in the Sal or DNP group were lower compared with A β 1-42-mice (Figure 4B), suggesting that Sal treatment was not inferior to DNP. The expression of A β and P-Tau protein was upregulated in the A β 1-42 group, as indicated by western blotting while the presentation of A β 1-42, p-Tau dropped in the DNP group. For comparison, this downregulate tendency was more pronounced in the Sal group (Figure 4C). Furthermore, Immunohistochemical staining showed that A β and p-Tau positive areas were signiﬁcantly increased in the hippocampal region of the A β 1-42 group, with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence compared with the regular group. Increased yellowish-brown A β plaque deposition and brown P-Tau deposits in the model group. Conversely, treatment with Sal or DNP marked reduced the positive area of A β and P-Tau in the hippocampal region, the yellowish-brown A β plaque deposition and brown P-Tau deposits are both decreased, with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence compared with the A β 1-42 group (Figures 5A,B). In short, the above results demonstrated that Sal could exert therapeutic eﬀects on AD by directly reducing both deposition of the A β peptide levels and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau. To determine whether Sal treatment can decrease the A β accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in D-gal/AlCl 3-mice, we ﬁrst carried out analyses by ELISA kits. The results indicated that the deposition of A β increased in the model group, which implied that the AD model was established successfully. Nevertheless, Sal, DNP groups all presented reductions in the Aβ deposition compared with the D-gal/AlCl 3 group, meaning Sal has similar eﬃcacy to DNP to exert therapy eﬀect on AD (Figure 4B). Next, to further conﬁrm the impact of Sal on the accumulation of A β and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in AD mice, the relative expression levels of Tau, p-Tau, and A β in the brain of AD mice were examined by Western blotting (Figure 4C). The result demonstrated that the expressions of p-Tau and A β were reduced in the Sal or DNP group, and the statistical signiﬁcance of the diﬀerences for comparison D-gal/AlCl3 group. Finally, IHC was performed. As shown in Figures 5A,B, the yellowish-brown A β plaque deposition and brown P-Tau deposits are both decreased in the Sal or DNP group. In summary, these ﬁndings suggest that Sal can improve the A β loaded and phosphorylation of Tau and subsequent pathology of D-gal/AlCl 3-mice. Sal Inhibited A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 Induced Pyroptosis in Mice In the present study, ELISA was used to evaluate the inﬂammatory cytokines, namely, IL-1 β and IL-18. Based on the ELISA results, the expression level of IL-1 β and IL-18 were signiﬁcantly elevated in the brain of AD mice induced by A β 1-42, suggesting that IL-1 β and IL-18 are cytokines that play crucial roles in pyroptosis and the onset of AD. As Figure 6 shows, the A β 1-42-mice treat applied Sal, the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the A β 1-42 group (Figures 6A,B). Subsequently, we further investigated the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, that is to say, IL-1β , IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD by western blotting. Results demonstrated that the protein level of IL-1 β , IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD increased in the A β 1-42 group compared with the regular group (Figure 6C). In comparison, the Sal group found a markedly reduced expression level of IL-1 β , IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD. Notably, GSDMD-N was cleaved by activated GSDMD, which could motivate the secretion of IL-1 β , IL-18, and subsequently drive pyroptosis (He et al., 2015). These results imply that pyroptosis is closely related to AD, and Sal could prevent pyroptosis in A β 1-42-induced AD mice. GSDMD is a crucial biomarker of pyroptosis. To explore the action and mechanism of Sal in pyroptosis, we assessed both the IL-1 β and IL-18 and the expression of GSDMD proteins related to the pyroptosis by ELISA kits and Western blotting analysis. ELISA results indicated that treatment with Sal gradually downregulated the secretion of IL-1 β and IL-18 induced by D-gal/AlCl 3 (Figures 6A,B). Western blot further conﬁrmed our results. The result showed that the protein levels of IL-1 β . IL-18, and cleaved GSDMD decreased in the Sal group (Figure 6C). These results demonstrate that pyroptosis may involve AD onset, and Sal could ameliorate the course of AD through inhibited pyroptosis. Sal Attenuated A β 1-42-Induced Pyroptosis Through Modulation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1 Signaling Pathways in Mice To explore Sal’s action and underlying mechanism in pyroptosis induced by A β 1-42, we validated it using IHC and western blotting. The western blotting results suggested that the expression of the proteins of NLRP3, ASC and cleaved Caspase-1 levels were increased in the A β 1-42-group (Figure 7A), the high expression of these proteins could be inhibited by administration with Sal. Consistently, the IHC exhibited that the increased brown NLRP3, cleaved Caspase-1 deposits were seen in the hippocampus of AD mice, and the brown deposits were suppressed with Sal, which indicates Sal can inhibit NLRP3/Caspase-1 (Figures 8A,B). Thus, the above data show that Sal can mitigate pyroptosis by inhibiting the NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathway. Sal Attenuated D-gal/AlCl 3-Induced Pyroptosis Through Modulation of the TLR4/NF-κ B/MyD88/NLRP3 and NLRP3/Caspase-1 Signaling Pathways in Mice Aβ 1-42 models for the potential mechanisms of Sal have revealed that Sal can ameliorate the pathological features of AD via inhibited pyroptosis. To further conﬁrm how Sal modulates pyroptosis, and in turn, intervenes in the pathogenesis of AD, we validated the results obtained from the A β 1-42 mice model using the D-gal/AlCl 3 mice model. As expected, Western blotting results showed an increase of TLR4, MyD88, p-NF- κ B, NLRP3, ASC, and Cleaved Caspase-1 protein expression levels in the model group. Conversely, these protein expressions were reduced in the Sal group (Figures 7A,B). Furthermore, the result of IHC is consistent with A β 1-42-mice (Figures 7C, 8A,B). Normal brain tissue sections showed no signiﬁcant positive expression under high magniﬁcation and increased brown TLR4, NLRP3, cleaved Caspase-1 deposits were seen in the hippocampus of AD mice, and small amounts of brown deposits were seen in the Sal groups. Thus, the above experiments veriﬁed that Sal inhibits pyroptosis by suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κ B/NLRP3 and NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway. Sal Protected PC12 Cells Against D-gal-Induced Cytotoxicity and Improved Viability To screen an optimum action concentration of D-gal, we ﬁrst added D-gal (10, 15, 30, 40, 50 mg/ml) to 96-well culture plates and allowed it to act on the PC12 cells for 48 h. As Figure 9 shows, cell viability decreased with the increase of D-gal action concentration, detected by the CCK8 assay (Figure 9B). Finally, D-gal (15 mg/ml), was selected as working concentrations for the subsequent experiments. To explore the action of Sal in D-gal induced cytotoxic and neuroprotective eﬀects on PC12 cells, assays were performed using a CCK-8 assay. As shown in Figure 9, after PC12 cells were exposed to Sal (2, 10, 50 µ M) for 24 h, there were no signiﬁcant hits for the viability of PC-12 cells (Figure 9A), suggesting that Sal did not alter the survival of PC12 cells. Subsequently, 2, 10, and 50 µ M of Sal were added to the culture media, and cells were pre-incubated for 2 h. Then, the cells were incubated with D-gal (15 mg/ml) for 48 h, ﬁnally using CCK-8 for analyses. As shown in Figure 9C, the percentage of PC12 cells was signiﬁcantly increased in the Sal-treated group compared to the D-gal group. The result implied that Sal might act to prevent PC12 cells from damage. Protective Effects of Sal Against PC12 Cells Damage Induced by D-gal via Regulating TLR4/NF-κ B/NLRP3/Caspase-1 Signaling Pathway To explore the underlying mechanisms of D-gal induced PC12 cells damage, ELISA was applied to determine the secretion of IL-1 β and IL-18. Results indicated that Sal considerably decreased the expression of IL-18 and IL-1 β in D-gal-induced PC12 cells, suggesting that Sal can exert mitigated pyroptosis via the decreased release of inﬂammatory factors (Figure 9E). Meanwhile, Western blotting analysis was used to analyze the TLR4-related and the NLRP3-related signaling pathway protein to verify the above hypothesis further. Consistent results were obtained. Protein expression was downregulated in the Sal group, including TLR4, MyD88, p-NF- κ B, NLRP3, ASC, Cleaved Caspase-1, Cleaved GSDMD, IL-1 β , and IL-18 (Figures 9F–H). Furthermore, immunoﬂuorescence assays conﬁrmed that the expression of TLR4, NLRP3, and cleaved Caspase-1 were signiﬁcantly reduced by treatment with Sal (Figure 9I). The above result is consistent with the previous two AD mice model results, indicating that Sal could suppress pyroptosis by inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κ B/NLRP3 and NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathways in D-gal-induced PC-12 cells. Effect of Sal on Nigericin-Induced NLRP3 Activation in PC12 Cells CCK-8 assays were conducted to screen a suitable concentration of Nigericin for our experiment. The Nigericin concentration chosen for this screening was 10 µ M (Figure 9D). As demonstrated for A β 1-42 and D-gal/AlCl 3 AD mice models and PC12 cells model, pyroptosis plays a critical role in the progression of various nervous system diseases (such as AD, PD, HD, and ALS) (Voet et al., 2019). In the present experiment, we aimed to explore the mechanism of Sal during the pathogenesis of AD. To further explore the action of Sal on NLRP3 activation, Western blotting was used to assess changes in NLRP3 and its downstream proteins in Nigericin + Sal-treated PC12 cells. As indicated in the ﬁgure, the level of NLRP3 and its downstream proteins was noticeably increased in the D-gal group compared to the normal group. By contrast, the level of NLRP3 was decreased in the Sal group compared with the D-gal group. Interestingly, compared with the Sal group, the Nigericin group eﬃciently reversed the reduced level of NLRP3 eﬀectively while increasing the level of ASC, cleaved Caspase-1, cleaved GSDMD, IL-1 β , and IL-18, a downstream target of NLRP3 (Figure 9J). Thus, the above results conﬁrmed that Sal inhibited pyroptosis mainly through targeting suppression of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome. NLRP3 Is Involved in the Inhibitory Effect of Sal on D-gal-Induced PC12 Cells Pyroptosis We hypothesized that Sal acts against D-gal-induced NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation by downregulating NLRP3. To test this, we knocked down NLRP3 expression in PC12 cells by siRNA. Firstly, the Western blot result showed that the sequence 1 of NLRP3 siRNA had a better eﬀect in silencing NLRP3 (Figure 10A). As shown in Figure 10B, we found that the NLRP3 siRNA group or Salidroside signiﬁcantly reversed D-gal induces upregulation of cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1β , and IL-18, further suggesting that NLRP3 inﬂammasome-mediated pyroptosis plays a central role in AD. At the same time, compared with the NLRP3 siRNA group, the Salidroside combined NLRP3 siRNA group failed to change the protein expression of cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1 β , and IL-18 in PC12 cells (Figure 10B). Moreover, NLRP3 siRNA or Salidroside rescued in cell viability induced by D-gal, and the Salidroside combined NLRP3 siRNA group failed to change cell viability compared with NLRP3 siRNA (Figure 10C). Collectively, the above data demonstrate that Salidroside inhibited pyroptosis by targeting the NLRP3 inﬂammasome."

ABSTRACT  
Microglia activation drives the pro-inflammatory activity in the early stages of Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD). 
However, the mechanistic basis is elusive, and the hypothesis of targeting microglia to prevent AD onset is little 
explored. Here, we demonstrated that upon LPS exposure, microglia shift towards an energetic phenotype 
characterised by high glycolysis and high mitochondrial respiration with dysfunction. Although the activity of 
electron transport chain (ETC) complexes is boosted by LPS, this is mostly devoted to the generation of reactive 
oxygen species. We showed that by inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) with dimethyl malonate (DMM), it 
is possible to modulate the LPS-induced metabolic rewiring, facilitating an anti-inflammatory phenotype. DMM 
improves mitochondrial function in a direct way and by reducing LPS-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. 
Moreover, the block of SDH with DMM inhibits the recruitment of hypoxia inducible-factor 1 α (HIF-1 α ), which 
mediates the induction of glycolysis and cytokine expression. Similar bioenergetic alterations were observed in 
the microglia isolated from AD mice (3xTg-AD), which present high levels of circulating LPS and brain toll-like 
receptor4 (TLR4). Moreover, this well-established model of AD was used to show a potential effect of SDH in -
hibition in vivo as DMM administration abrogated brain inflammation and modulated the microglia metabolic 
alterations of 3xTg-AD mice. The RNA-sequencing analysis from a public dataset confirmed the consistent 
transcription of genes encoding for ETC subunits in the microglia of AD mice (5xFAD). In conclusion, TLR4 
activation promotes metabolic changes and the pro-inflammatory activity in microglia, and SDH might represent 
a promising therapeutic target to prevent AD development.   
1. Introduction 
Alzheimer ’ s Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, a 
continuous decline in thinking, behavioural and social skills. AD is 
macroscopically characterised by a cortical atrophy, while on the 
cellular level, extracellular inflammatory or neuritic (NP) senile plaques 
can be found, consisting of beta-type amyloid (A β ) protein aggregates 
and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyper -
phosphorylated tau protein aggregates [ 1 ]. However, microglia, 
“ brain-resident macrophages ” , have recently emerged as major patho -
genic drivers in almost all neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [ 2 ]. 
When activated, microglia adopt an inflammatory phenotype and exert 
a neurotoxic effect through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i. 
e. IL-1 β , TNF- α and IL-6) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 2 ]. 
Recently, the key role of toll-like receptors (TLRs), and in particular 
TLR4, in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, has emerged [ 3 , 4 ]. 
In the brain, TLR4 is mainly expressed on the surface of microglia, and in 
AD its expression increases in parallel with accumulation of A β , leading

to microglia activation with consequent inflammation, neuronal 
dysfunction and further A β and tau deposition [ 5 ]. Therefore, although 
TLR4 is conventionally considered the key receptor for LPS recognition 
[ 6 , 7 ], it seems to be also involved in phagocytosis and removal of A β 
plaque [ 8 , 9 ]. On the other hand, high levels of LPS have been found in 
the blood and in the brain of AD patients, so that LPS has been proposed 
as a mediator between gut dysbiosis and amyloid pathology [ 10 , 11 ]. 
Overall, these findings have suggested to target TLR4 in preclinical 
studies, showing some beneficial effects in terms of neuronal inflam -
mation and oxidative stress [ 12 ]. However, despite the promising re -
sults, the translational approach is not feasible yet and the research of 
other interacting factors is needed. Recent evidence reported that 
TLR4-mediated inflammatory activity seems to be fuelled by a metabolic 
reprogramming as LPS-activated microglia rely on glycolysis, and 
cytokine production increases under high-glucose conditions [ 6 , 7 ]. In 
accordance, glucose seems to be the main energy source for microglia in 
AD, although other substrates can be also used [ 8 ]. In this regard, studies 
of immunometabolism shed light on the importance of metabolic 
reprogramming as a driving force of pro-inflammatory activation and 
cell differentiation in immune cells, including macrophages [ 9 ]. It is 
conventionally known that activated M1 macrophages rely on glycolytic 
metabolism to supply the pro-inflammatory activity, while oxidative 
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) would represent the main energy source of 
resting and regulatory phenotypes (e.g. M2 macrophages or Treg lym -
phocytes) [ 13 – 15 ]. Since the TLR4-mediated activation of microglia 
reflects an important player in AD, we investigated the role of microglia 
immunometabolism by dissecting cellular bioenergetics in 
LPS-activated human microglia, and studying potential applications in a 
well-established murine model of AD. 
2. Material and methods 
2.1. HMC3 culture 
HMC3 human microglia cell line (ATCC ® ) was cultured in Eagle ’ s 
Minimum Essential Medium (Corning) supplemented with 10% of fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (P/S; Sigma 
Aldrich) in 6 well-plates with 2x10
5 
cells per well. 
2.2. Stimulation of HMC3 
As reported by ATCC ® and recent studies, the human cell line HMC3 
retains the properties of primary microglial cells [ 16 – 18 ], and expresses 
also more specific microglial markers recently described [ 19 ], repre -
senting a valid system for biochemical and functional studies of micro -
glia. This permitted to study pathogenetic mechanisms in human cells 
and to overcome the necessity of killing a large number of animals to 
have sufficient primary cells for the several studies performed. There -
fore, animal model and primary cells analysis were used to give a 
translational meaning to the work. 
After seeding in 6 well-plates, HMC3 cells were stimulated with LPS 
(1 μ g/mL) ( Escherichia coli O111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich) and simultaneously 
treated with dimethyl malonate (DMM) (10 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 
h prior to perform bioenergetic analyses and isolate RNA, proteins or 
mitochondria. To evaluate the role of TLR4 in the cytokine production, 
HMC3 cells were stimulated with TAK-242 (Cayman chemical), a spe -
cific inhibitor of TLR4 signalling, at 1 μ M concentration for 1 h prior to 
the addition of LPS. Moreover, the role of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α 
(HIF-1 α ) and its link with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) was firstly 
studied by stimulating with LPS (1 μ g/mL) + /- S-2-amino-3-[4 ′ -N,N,-bis 
(2-chloroethyl) amino]-phenyl propionic acid N-oxide dihydrochloride 
(PX-478) (Cayman chemical), a HIF-1 α inhibitor, at 10 μ M concentra -
tion for 24 h, and in a second step, with diethyl succinate (here indicated 
as Succ) (5 mM) for 3 h prior to add LPS (1 μ g/mL) and DMM (10 mM) 
for 24 h. β -Amyloid peptide (1-42) (A β
1-42
) was prepared according to 
manufacturer ’ s protocol, diluted in calcium and magnesium-free PBS 
and incubated for 24 h at 37 ◦ C to pre- aggregate the peptides. Then, 
HMC3 were stimulated with A β
1-42 
(10 ug/mL), after testing different 
concentrations ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), for 24 h ± a pre-treatment for 1 
h with TAK-242 (1 μ M). In another experimental setting it was analysed 
the effect of long-lasting exposure with LPS (1 μ g/mL), every day for 10 
days, + /- DMM (10 mM) the last day only. Doses and administration 
times of DMM, TAK-242, diethyl succinate and A β were selected based 
on other relevant articles [ 9 , 20 , 21 ] and/or testing different concentra -
tions, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 . 
2.3. Animal experimental model 
6- and 18-month-old male Non-Tg (n = 29) and 3xTg-AD (n = 50) 
mice with 3 mutant human genes (APP
Swe
, PS
1M146V 
and tau
P301L
) were 
used for in vivo and ex vivo studies. The 3xTg-AD mice have been 
genetically engineered by LaFerla and colleagues at the Department of 
Neurobiology and Behaviour, University of California, Irvine. Colonies 
of homozygous 3xTg-AD and Non-Tg mice were established at the 
University of Foggia, Italy. This model exhibits AD-like plaques and 
tangles associated with synaptic dysfunction [ 22 – 26 ]. The 3 × Tg-AD 
mice background strain is a C57BL6/129SvJ hybrid, and genotypes were 
confirmed from tail biopsy. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with 
DMM (160 mg/kg) [ 20 ] or vehicle, Dulbecco ’ s Phosphate Buffered Sa -
line (PBS), once a day for 3 days, and then sacrificed. Mice were raised 
under 22 
◦
C temperature, 12/12-h light/dark cycle and ad libitum ac -
cess to fresh food and water. Mice brain cortex was collected for histo -
logical and molecular studies, while another court was used for freshly 
isolation of microglia. All the experiments were performed in accor -
dance with the Italian National Laws (DL 116/92) and the European 
Communities Council Directives (86/609/EEC). 
2.4. Microglia isolation from mice brains 
Microglia cells were freshly obtained from the cerebral cortices of 6- 
and 18-month-old Non-Tg or 3xTg-AD mice, as previously reported [ 27 ] 
with some modifications. Meninges and cerebellum were carefully 
removed, and the tissues were triturated with a 15 T scalpel blade in 
ice-cold Dulbecco ’ s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 
(DMEM/F12; Sigma) containing 1% P/S and 1% of Glucose (Sigma 
Aldrich). Minced brains were transferred to a 50 ml falcon tube con -
taining a dissociation medium (HBSS 1X; Sigma with 20 U/ml DNase I 
and 2 mg/ml collagenase) and the tube was gently inverted in a cell 
incubator at 37 
◦
C for 20 min. After two sequential centrifugation pellet 
was resuspended in DMEM/F12 medium. A cell suspension was ob -
tained by pipetting up and down with a serological pipette against the 
bottom of tube until large clumps of tissue were broken up and there -
after by passing the cell solution through a 70 μ m cell-strainer. Microglia 
separation from myelin was achieved using a 30% Percoll solution; the 
pellet containing microglial cells was resuspended in culture medium 
(DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS and 1% P/S) and plated on T-25 flasks (for 
mRNA isolation) or in Seahorse-96-well plate, for bioenergetic analysis 
(1 x 10
5 
cells per well). After a 1-h incubation at 37 
◦
C in a humidified 
5% CO
2 
incubator, culture medium was removed and replaced with a 
fresh one to remove floating debris. 
2.5. Measurement of Real-Time ECAR and OCR 
Real-time extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen con -
sumption rate (OCR) were measured using a Seahorse XFe96 analyser 
(Agilent, Santa Clara, US) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions, 
with minor modifications. 2 x 10
5 
HCM3 cells or 1 x 10

primary isolated 
microglia were plated on the XFe96 cell culture microplate and cultured 
as indicated. The utility plate was hydrated with sterile water (200 μ l/ 
well) and incubated overnight (37

utility plate with the cartridge containing injector ports and sensors was 
run on the Seahorse for calibration. Consequently, the utility plate was 
removed, and the cartridge positioned on the cell plate for analysis. The 
assay medium (Seahorse XF DMEM assay medium, pH 7.4) was prepared 
immediately before assay. For ECAR and OCR measurements in HMC3, 
in all experimental settings the exposure to molecules was performed for 
24 h, then the medium replaced before loading the plate into the Sea -
horse XFe96 analyser. OCR was measured under basal conditions and 
after sequential injection of specific inhibitors: oligomycin A (1 μ M), 
carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (1 μ M) 
and rotenone/antimycin A (1 μ M). Oligomycin A stops ATP-synthase, 
permitting to evaluate the quote of respiration addressed to ATP pro -
duction; the FCCP is an uncoupler which dissipates proton gradient and 
allow to measure the maximal respiratory capacity. Rotenone/Anti -
mycin A (complex I and III inhibitors, respectively) are finally injected in 
order to block electron transport chain (ETC), measuring the non- 
mitochondrial respiration level. ECAR was measured under basal con -
ditions and after sequential injection of oligomycin A (1 μ M) and 2- 
deoxy-glucose (2-DG) (50 Mm). Oligomycin A boosts glycolysis block -
ing mitochondrial ATP production, permitting to evaluate the glycolysis 
capacity. 2-DG inhibits glycolysis. Analysis was performed using Wave 
software. 
2.6. qPCR 
Total RNA was isolated from cultured HMC3 and mice frozen brain 
cortices using QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen). Equal amounts of RNA 
were reverse transcribed to cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA reverse 
transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer ’ s 
instructions. Real-time PCR was performed, using Sso Advanced uni -
versal SYBR green supermix on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time system as 
previously reported [ 13 , 28 ]. The cycle threshold (Ct) was determined 
and the relative gene expression was calculated with the ΔΔ CT method. 
The gene expression was normalized to human or mouse β -actin. Primers 
are listed in Table 1 in Supplementary . 
2.7. Western blot analysis 
A standard protocol was used to perform Western blot analysis (Bio- 
Rad Laboratories). Lysates from HMC3 were prepared in RIPA lysis 
buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Lysates with 
equal amounts of protein (40 μ g) were loaded in an 8% SDS-PAGE, 
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked with 
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% 
Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, membranes were 
incubated overnight at 4 
◦
C with these following primary antibodies: 
HIF-1 α (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and β -actin (1:1000, Sigma- 
Aldrich), as loading control. Therefore, membranes were incubated with 
the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling 
Technology) for 1 h at room temperature and bands were detected by 
the ClarityTM Western ECL Blotting Substrate using a ChemiDoc MP 
system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Segrate (MI), Italy) and quantified by 
the Image LabTM Software. 
2.8. Preparation of mitochondria-enriched fractions for mitochondrial 
complexes enzymatic activity 
The mitochondria-enriched fractions from cell suspension were 
prepared as previously reported [ 13 , 28 – 30 ] with minor adjustments. 
Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and 
centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 6 min at 4 
◦
C. Supernatant was carefully 
removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mM/L Tris, pH 7.6, 
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich), freeze 
thawed three times in liquid nitrogen. Cells were also mechanically 
disrupted with a 2-mL glass/teflon potter on ice. The concentration of 
mitochondria enriched cell suspension was estimated by Bradford assay. 
The purity check was performed by western-blot, staining proliferating 
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Cell signaling, 1:1000), cytochrome c (Cell 
signaling, 1:1000) and α -tubulin (Cell signaling, 1:1000), as nuclear, 
mitochondrial and cytosolic marker, respectively . 
2.9. Complex I assay 
Complex I enzymatic activity was measured spectrophotometrically 
at 600 nm as previously reported [ 13 , 28 , 29 ]. Briefly, 40 μ g of each 
enzyme solution was mixed with complex I buffer (25 mM/L potassium 
phosphate, 3.5 g/L fatty acid free BSA), 60 μ M/L 2,6-Dichlorophenolin -
dophenol (DCPIP), 70 μ M/L decylubiquinone (DBH), 1.0 μ M/L 
antimycin-A) and incubated for 3 min at 37 
◦
C. Then, we added 10 
mM/L NADH and measured the absorbance for 4 min at 37 
◦
C. Later, the 
reference was measured in the presence of 2.5 μ M rotenone. Enzyme 
activity was calculated with molar extinction coefficient ( ε ) for the 
DCPIP (19.1 mM
","This article discusses the role of metabolic reprogramming in microglia, particularly focusing on their involvement in neuroinflammation. It highlights how alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics and glycolytic pathways can influence inflammatory responses in microglia, which are critical for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Key points include:

- Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other stimuli activate microglia through metabolic changes.
- Mitochondrial complex I activity suppresses inflammation while enhancing bone resorption by shifting macrophage polarization towards osteoclasts.
- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a significant role in microglial activation and function.
- Metformin can inhibit ROS production from NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, thereby limiting IL-1β induction while boosting IL-10 in LPS-activated macrophages.
- HIF-1α inhibitors like PX-478 reduce inflammation by targeting metabolic pathways involved in immune cell activation.

The article also emphasizes the importance of understanding these metabolic changes for developing therapeutic strategies against AD and other neuroinflammatory conditions.","Microglia activation drives the pro-inflammatory activity in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanistic basis is elusive, and the hypothesis of targeting microglia to prevent AD onset is little explored. Here, we demonstrated that upon LPS exposure, microglia shift towards an energetic phenotype characterised by high glycolysis and high mitochondrial respiration with dysfunction. Although the activity of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes is boosted by LPS, this is mostly devoted to the generation of reactive oxygen species. We showed that by inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) with dimethyl malonate (DMM), it is possible to modulate the LPS-induced metabolic rewiring, facilitating an anti-inflammatory phenotype. DMM improves mitochondrial function in a direct way and by reducing LPS-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, the block of SDH with DMM inhibits the recruitment of hypoxia inducible-factor 1 α (HIF-1 α ), which mediates the induction of glycolysis and cytokine expression. Similar bioenergetic alterations were observed in the microglia isolated from AD mice (3xTg-AD), which present high levels of circulating LPS and brain toll-like receptor4 (TLR4). Moreover, this well-established model of AD was used to show a potential effect of SDH inhibition in vivo as DMM administration abrogated brain inflammation and modulated the microglia metabolic alterations of 3xTg-AD mice. The RNA-sequencing analysis from a public dataset confirmed the consistent transcription of genes encoding for ETC subunits in the microglia of AD mice (5xFAD). In conclusion, TLR4 activation promotes metabolic changes and the pro-inflammatory activity in microglia, and SDH might represent a promising therapeutic target to prevent AD development.","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, a continuous decline in thinking, behavioural and social skills. AD is macroscopically characterised by a cortical atrophy, while on the cellular level, extracellular inflammatory or neuritic (NP) senile plaques can be found, consisting of beta-type amyloid (A β ) protein aggregates and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyper-phosphorylated tau protein aggregates [ 1 ]. However, microglia, “brain-resident macrophages”, have recently emerged as major pathogenic drivers in almost all neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [ 2 ]. When activated, microglia adopt an inflammatory phenotype and exert a neurotoxic effect through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-1 β , TNF- α and IL-6) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 2 ]. Recently, the key role of toll-like receptors (TLRs), and in particular TLR4, in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, has emerged [ 3 , 4 ]. In the brain, TLR4 is mainly expressed on the surface of microglia, and in AD its expression increases in parallel with accumulation of A β , leading to microglia activation with consequent inflammation, neuronal dysfunction and further A β and tau deposition [ 5 ]. Therefore, although TLR4 is conventionally considered the key receptor for LPS recognition [ 6 , 7 ], it seems to be also involved in phagocytosis and removal of A β plaque [ 8 , 9 ]. On the other hand, high levels of LPS have been found in the blood and in the brain of AD patients, so that LPS has been proposed as a mediator between gut dysbiosis and amyloid pathology [ 10 , 11 ]. Overall, these findings have suggested to target TLR4 in preclinical studies, showing some beneficial effects in terms of neuronal inflammation and oxidative stress [ 12 ]. However, despite the promising results, the translational approach is not feasible yet and the research of other interacting factors is needed. Recent evidence reported that TLR4-mediated inflammatory activity seems to be fuelled by a metabolic reprogramming as LPS-activated microglia rely on glycolysis, and cytokine production increases under high-glucose conditions [ 6 , 7 ]. In accord, glucose seems to be the main energy source for microglia in AD, although other substrates can be also used [ 8 ]. In this regard, studies of immunometabolism shed light on the importance of metabolic reprogramming as a driving force of pro-inflammatory activation and cell differentiation in immune cells, including macrophages [ 9 ]. It is conventionally known that activated M1 macrophages rely on glycolytic metabolism to supply the pro-inflammatory activity, while oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) would represent the main energy source of resting and regulatory phenotypes (e.g. M2 macrophages or Treg lymphocytes) [ 13 – 15 ]. Since the TLR4-mediated activation of microglia reflects an important player in AD, we investigated the role of microglia immunometabolism by dissecting cellular bioenergetics in LPS-activated human microglia, and studying potential applications in a well-established murine model of AD.","The results of this study demonstrate that LPS-activated microglia exhibit a metabolic shift characterized by increased glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, with the latter being associated with dysfunction and increased ROS production. We found that inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) with dimethyl malonate (DMM) effectively modulated this LPS-induced metabolic rewiring, promoting an anti-inflammatory phenotype. DMM treatment improved mitochondrial function and reduced LPS-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, blocking SDH with DMM inhibited the recruitment of HIF-1 α , a key mediator of glycolysis and cytokine expression. Similar metabolic alterations were observed in microglia isolated from 3xTg-AD mice, which showed elevated levels of circulating LPS and brain TLR4. In vivo administration of DMM to 3xTg-AD mice abrogated brain inflammation and normalized microglial metabolic profiles. RNA-sequencing analysis of microglia from a public dataset of 5xFAD mice confirmed the upregulation of genes encoding ETC subunits. These findings collectively suggest that TLR4 activation drives metabolic changes and pro-inflammatory activity in microglia, and that SDH inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing AD development."

ABSTRACT  
Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD), the main dementia type accounting for over 70 % of the entire dementia population 
and exhibits progressive decline in memory and executive function. AD pathology is characterized by amyloid 
fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine, consistently colocalizes with the amyloid deposits is characteristic of Alz -
heimer ’ s disease and may contribute to the generation of amyloid proteins. AChE is a potent amyloid-promoting 
factor as compared with other associated proteins. AChE inhibitors play a vital role to prevent the formation of 
toxic oligomeric form of amyloid peptide. Recent studies have reported that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChE- 
Is) are present in plants, fungi, and marine products. Some cholinesterase inhibitors, obtained from plant source 
such as rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine, used in the treatment of AD, offer an alternative approach to 
alleviate its symptoms by reducing A β . 
Due to limited efficacy of currently available drugs for AD, there is huge potential of phytomedicines for the 
treatment of AD. Medicinal herbs and herbal drug preparations have traditionally been used to treat neurological 
disorders such as AD by exhibiting its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Phytomedicines con -
taining flavonoids, polyphenols, and other naturally occurring antioxidants crosses the blood-brain barrier and 
protect neurons from oxidative stress. As compared to synthetic drugs, phytomedicines have fewer side effects. 
Therefore, recent research is focused to explore the potential of phytomedicines and develop it as effective 
treatment for AD. In our review, we summarized the pathology of AD, amyloid-deposition, role of Acetylcho -
linesterase, potential of phytoconstituents with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity for AD treatment.   
1. Introduction 
Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by 
ageing and selective loss of neurons leading to impairment of learning 
and memory [ 1 ]. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, 
and amyloid-beta peptide deposition around dystrophic reactive glial 
cells are neuropathological hallmarks in AD patients [ 2 ]. The primary 
component of senile plaques and significantly increased neurotoxin 
(amyloid-beta peptide) are linked to dysfunction of laminin, apolipo -
protein E, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [ 3 , 4 ]. Co-localization of A β 
deposits with AChE has been observed in mature senile plaques, 
pre-amyloid diffused deposits, and cerebral blood vessels [ 5 , 6 ]. AChE 
activity in the AD brain is linked to the amyloid core of senile plaques, 
rather than the neuritic (senile plaques) [ 7 ]. Amyloidoses is a 
protein-misfolding disorders characterized by accumulation of insoluble 
fibrillar protein complexes in the extracellular component. There are 25

forms of human proteins and polypeptides as amyloid deposits, 
including the prion protein (PrP) and 39-43-residue amyloid peptide in 
AD [ 8 ]. Choline acetyltransferase is a single-strand globular protein that 
catalyzes the biosynthetic reaction of the acetylcholine neurotrans -
mitter, while acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes acetylcholine into acetic 
acid and choline in the central nervous system (CNS) [ [ 5 , 9 – 11 ]]. Ma -
jority of AChE molecules are present in tetrameric form AChE to 
neuronal cell membranes and involved in both cholinergic and 
non-cholinergic function in the central and peripheral nervous systems. 
Biochemical studies showed that neurotoxicity accelerated by AChE-A β 
complexes increases neurodegeneration as compared to amyloid- β 
peptides alone [ 11 ]. AChE catalytic activity is crucial for cholinergic 
neuron to return to its resting state after activation [ 12 ]. Inhibiting the 
activity of the AChE enzyme increases acetylcholine level, which is 
essential for transmission between brain cells by breaking it down into 
acetylcholine in the brain [ 13 ]. In AD patients, cortical cholinergic 
function is compromised due to decreased cerebral choline acetyl -
transferase production, which decrease the acetylcholine synthesis [ 14 ]. 
Several types of neurons deteriorate as AD progresses, however, fore -
brain cholinergic neurons suffer a profound loss and accompanied by 
steady decline of acetylcholine. ChAT, the acetylcholine-synthesizing 
enzyme, and AChE activity are vastly affected in AD [ 15 ]. Despite the 
overall decrease in the activity of AChE in the AD patient, current AD 
therapy mostly targets the inhibitors of AChE (AChE-I), which enhance 
cholinergic transmission, but have modest and transient therapeutic 
effects [ 16 ]. Although the distribution of AChE molecular forms spe -
cifically affects the AD brain, the pathophysiological relevance and 
subsequent ramifications of these alterations in AChE enzyme remain 
unknown even though it has been known for almost 50 years. 
An increase in AChE enzyme levels is a hallmark of AD [ 17 ]. For 
Alzheimer ’ s disease treatment, only a few synthetic medications are 
approved by the FDA, and it provides only symptomatic relief and have 
more side effects. Phytomedicine has been explored as an alternative 
approach to alleviate Alzheimer ’ s symptoms [ 18 , 19 ]. Some plants 
contain phytochemicals (Curcumin, Resveratrol, Epigallocate 
chin-3-gallate, Morin, Delphinidins, Quercetin, Luteolin) that enhances 
brain function and counteract oxidative stress. The therapeutic potential 
of herbal remedies, including Lavandula angustifolia, Ginkgo biloba , and 
Salvia officinalis has been shown to improve cognitive performance in 
mild to moderate AD [ 20 , 21 ]. 
Certain plants contain natural compounds that improve brain func -
tion and fight oxidative stress. Herbal remedies like lavender, ginkgo 
biloba, and sage have been found to enhance cognitive abilities in 
people with mild to moderate Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) [ 22 ]. These 
natural compounds may offer a new and effective strategy to treat AD 
and delay its onset. Some promising plant-based treatments are 
currently undergoing trials for AD. Bacterial extracellular vesicles 
(BEVs) show promise for delivering therapies for neurodegenerative 
diseases worldwide because they can interact with cells effectively [ 23 ]. 
Researchers are also exploring vaccines as a new approach to treating 
AD [ 24 ], targeting key factors like tau protein and beta-amyloid plaques. 
Developing drugs that can target multiple aspects of the disease simul -
taneously is becoming more important. Exosomes, tiny vesicles that can 
cross the blood-brain barrier, are being investigated for their potential to 
deliver treatments directly to the brain for conditions like AD [ 25 ]. 
Our review article provides an overview of Alzheimer ’ s disease, 
including its pathology, amyloid-deposition, and the role of acetylcho -
linesterase. It also highlights the potential of phytoconstituents with 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity for the treatment of AD.

3. Metabolic disease and Alzheimer ’ s disease 
The relationship between Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer ’ s 
Disease (AD) is complex and involves various factors such as insulin 
resistance, abnormal glucose metabolism, lipid imbalances, obesity- 
related inflammation, and impaired insulin signaling [ 27 ]. While the 
exact role of these factors in cognitive impairment is not fully under -
stood, they are believed to contribute to the progression of AD. Type-2 
diabetes mellitus, in particular, has a strong correlation with AD, and 
individuals with diabetes have a higher risk of developing AD compared 
to non-diabetics [ [ 28 – 31 ]]. Obesity is also a significant risk factor for 
AD, as it impairs brain function and increases the risk of cognitive 
decline [ 32 , 33 ]. Additionally, vascular pathology [ 16 , 34 ], genetic fac -
tors [ [ 35 – 37 ]], and inflammatory processes are involved in the devel -
opment of AD. The vascular system, including cerebral blood flow and 
endothelial function, plays a crucial role in AD pathology. Genetic 
variations, such as the APOE ε 4 allele, are associated with an increased 
risk of developing AD. Inflammatory processes involving cytokines and 
microglia contribute to the progression of AD [ [ 38 – 40 ]]. Furthermore, 
the amylin signaling pathway [ 41 , 42 ], Wnt signaling pathway [ 43 , 44 ], 
and chemokine receptors are implicated in AD pathogenesis. Overall, 
these factors collectively contribute to the development and progression 
of AD, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the disease. 
3.1. AD pathology and signaling pathways 
AD is multifactorial, complex, and prevalent neurological disorders 
worldwide. There has been extensive research in this field for the past 
five decades, however the exact mechanism of pathogenesis is still un -
known. Obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, cholinergic pathways, 
Interleukin Receptor-Associated Kinase 4 Signaling pathway, cholin -
ergic system, and Wnt signaling pathways are associated with AD [ 45 ]. 
The current review aims to provide a comprehensive and descriptive 
explanation of these pathways to generate in-depth knowledge of their 
role in AD. Understanding the pathology of AD and its related alterations 
on various metabolic, hormonal, and molecular pathways, as well as 
targeted interventions, could be correlated with age-related cognitive 
decline [ 46 ]. 
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is primarily known for its role in 
breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but it can also in -
fluence various cellular processes beyond cholinergic neuro 
transmission. 
3.1.1. Interleukin Receptor-Associated Kinase-4 (IRAK-4) and microglia 
AChE has been implicated in modulating the immune response and 
inflammation, which are relevant to microglia and IRAK-4 signaling [ 
[ 47 – 49 ]]. AChE can affect the production and release of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 β (IL-1 β ), tumor ne -
crosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ), and IL-6 [ 50 , 51 ]. In conditions involving 
microglial activation and neuroinflammation, AChE activity can influ -
ence the extent of the inflammatory response mediated by IRAK-4 and 
other signaling pathways Fig. 2 [ 52 ]. 
3.1.2. Mononuclear phagocyte system 
The mononuclear phagocyte system consists of immune cells, 
including microglia and peripheral monocytes/macrophages, which 
play a role in immune surveillance and phagocytosis in the brain [ 54 ]. 
AChE activity can impact the function and behavior of microglia and

other phagocytic cells within this system [ 55 ]. By modulating AChE 
levels or activity, it may be possible to influence the immune response 
mediated by microglia and other mononuclear phagocytes [ 49 ]. 
3.1.3. Wnt signaling pathway 
The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in various cellular processes, 
including neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and neuro -
protection Fig. 3 [ 56 ]. AChE can interact with the Wnt signaling 
pathway through its influence on acetylcholine levels. Acetylcholine can 
activate the Wnt pathway and promote neuroprotective effects [ 57 ]. 
Therefore, by regulating acetylcholine breakdown, AChE may indirectly 
impact Wnt signaling and its downstream effects on neuronal function 
and synaptic plasticity [ 58 ]. 
3.1.4. Amylin signaling dichotomy 
The exact role of AChE in the amylin signaling dichotomy is not well- 
established. Amylin is primarily associated with metabolic processes 
and appetite regulation, although it has also been implicated in neuro -
protection and neurotoxicity [ 60 , 61 ]. AChE ’ s involvement in the amylin 
signaling dichotomy would likely depend on its interaction with 
acetylcholine and the downstream effects on amylin signaling pathways. 
However, the specific mechanisms of AChE ’ s influence on amylin 
signaling in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer ’ s 
disease are still being investigated. 
AChE can influence the functioning of microglia, chemokine re -
ceptors, the mononuclear phagocyte system, and the Wnt signaling 
pathway through its impact on neurotransmission, immune response 
modulation, and cellular signaling. However, the precise mechanisms 
and interactions between AChE and these pathways are complex and 
require further research for a comprehensive understanding [ 61 ]. 
3.1.5. Autophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy and ubiquitin/ 
proteasome and/lysosome pathways in AD 
The term “ autophagy ” encompasses a set of pathways that transfer 
cytoplasmic waste to lysosomes for degradation, including 
macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and micro -
autophagy. These pathways play a vital role in maintaining cellular 
homeostasis by degrading aggregate-prone proteins and dysfunctional 
organelles like mitochondria. The nervous system primarily relies on 
autophagic pathways since post-mitotic neurons are unable to reduce 
the accumulation of undesirable proteins and organelles during cell di -
vision. However, as people become older and the brain ’ s ability to do the 
functions decreases, this dependence could become vulnerable. It has 
been suggested that autophagic mechanisms protect against neuro -
degeneration [ 62 ] . 
The production and clearance of A β are significantly regulated by 
autophagy. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved in autophago -
somes during the autophagic turnover of APP-rich organelles, resulting 
in the production of A β peptides. Autophagolysosomes, or autophago -
somes that have fused with lysosomes, are impeded in their maturation 
and retrograde movement towards the neuronal body in Alzheimer ’ s 
disease (AD) [ 63 ]. As a result, there is a considerable accumulation of 
autophagic vacuoles in the neurons, which may be related to the 
dysfunction of ESCRT-III complex, and associated neurodegeneration 
[ 63 , 64 ] . 
Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is another proteolytic 
mechanism that facilitates the disintegration of intracellular proteins in 
lysosomes. CMA selectively targets substrate proteins to lysosomes and 
translocate them into the lysosomal lumen with the aid of chaperones 
and a particular protein translocation complex. The modulatory role of 
CMA in enzymatic metabolic processes and subsets of the cellular 
transcriptional programme is supported by its selectivity, which enables 
the timed degradation of certain proteins with regulatory objectives. 
Dysfunctional CMA has been implicated in severe human disorders such 
as neurodegeneration and AD [ 65 ] . 
Chaperone-mediated autophagy is a critical process in the degrada -
tion of certain proteins in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as 
Parkinson ’ s disease and Alzheimer ’ s disease. The pathogenic process is 
aggravated by the formation of toxic protein aggregates in the central 
nervous system, which is a result of CMA dysfunction in NDs [ 66 ]. In

Gajendra et al.

numerous models, strategies to increase CMA activity have demon -
strated promise in promoting the degradation of ND-associated proteins 
and reducing ND phenotypes [ 67 , 68 ] . 
Reduced activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is linked 
to Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD). The accumulation of harmful substances 
linked to long-term memory impairment and synaptic plasticity is 
facilitated by this decline. Intracellular C-terminal membrane fragment 
b (CTFb) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been identified as 
an early initiator of these disruptions, acting as a major toxic agent that 
negatively impacts neuronal function and grows to be a significant 
pathogenic factor for AD as well as a possible biomarker for AD patients 
[ 69 ] . 
3.2. Role AChE in metabolic syndrome X and AD pathogenesis 
Insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemias, metabolic syndrome X, and Alzheimer ’ s disease are 
considered low-grade systemic inflammatory conditions. While some 
studies have shown elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C- 
reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF- α ), and lipid peroxides, along with decreased levels of nitric oxide 
(NO), in the plasma of affected patients, other studies have not consis -
tently confirmed these findings Fig. 4 [ 70 , 71 ]. This suggests the need for 
more reliable and straightforward markers of low-grade systemic 
inflammation. In this context, the observation that the activities of 
acetylcholinesterase enzymes are increased in the plasma and red blood 
cells of patients with insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemias, metabolic syndrome X, and Alzheimer ’ s 
disease is intriguing [ [ 72 – 74 ]]. This finding suggests that these enzyme 
activities could potentially serve as markers of low-grade systemic 
inflammation present in these conditions. Acetylcholine (ACh), the 
substrate for these enzymes, has anti-inflammatory properties and 
serves as an important neurotransmitter [ 75 ]. Therefore, measuring the 
activities of acetylcholinesterase may indirectly provide insights into 
ACh concentrations in the brain, particularly in Alzheimer ’ s disease 
[ 76 ]. Moreover, there is growing recognition of the potential involve -
ment of the hypothalamus and other brain centers in the pathogenesis of 
insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and 
metabolic syndrome X. Hence, measuring the activities of acetylcho -
linesterase may also reflect the role of the hypothalamus and other brain 
centers in the development of these diseases [ 73 , 74 ]. If 
acetylcholinesterase activities prove to be reliable and robust markers of 
inflammation, they could potentially be used to predict the develop -
ment, prognosis, and response to treatment not only for insulin resis -
tance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 71 ], hypertension, metabolic 
syndrome X, and Alzheimer ’ s disease but also for other low-grade sys -
temic inflammatory conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, can -
cer, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease [ 77 ]. 
Insulin Regulation: Acetylcholine, through its action on muscarinic 
receptors, can stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. 
Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels, and 
dysfunction in insulin production or action is a characteristic feature of 
type 2 diabetes [ 78 ]. Disruptions in the cholinergic system or alterations 
in AChE activity may impact acetylcholine levels and subsequently in -
fluence insulin regulation [ 79 ]. Inflammation is a contributing factor to 
the development of insulin resistance, a condition in which cells become 
less responsive to the effects of insulin. While AChE is not directly 
involved in this pathway, alterations in acetylcholine levels, influenced 
by AChE activity, may impact the inflammatory processes involved in 
insulin resistance [ 80 ]. 
Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction: Type 2 diabetes is associ -
ated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which affects the 
regulation of various bodily functions, including digestion, metabolism, 
and glucose homeostasis. Acetylcholine is a key neurotransmitter 
involved in the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous sys -
tem, which regulates resting and digestive functions. Changes in AChE 
activity or acetylcholine levels may contribute to autonomic dysfunction 
observed in type 2 diabetes [ 81 ]. 
While these potential links exist, it ’ s important to note that type 2 
diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder influenced by multiple factors, 
including genetics, lifestyle choices, AD, obesity, and insulin resistance. 
The specific role of AChE in the development or progression of type 2 
diabetes requires further research to establish a clear and direct rela -
tionship [ 82 ]. 
Obesity is a chronic disease characterized by the excessive accumu -
lation of body fat, which is associated with metabolic disorders such as 
low-grade chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. Detecting low- 
grade tissue-specific inflammation can be challenging, and therefore, 
the enzymatic activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) have been pro -
posed as surrogate markers of systemic inflammation in obesity and 
other metabolic disorders. Acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter, 
plays a role in regulating neuropeptides and immune responses [ 77 , 83 ].

K. Gajendra et al.

AChE, by inactivating ACh, may contribute to inflammation. Studies 
indicate that visceral obesity and the metabolic syndrome are linked to 
increased sympathetic neural drive and impaired vagal signaling [77, 
83]. The mechanisms connecting the metabolic syndrome with sympa -
thetic activation involve various factors such as pro-inflammatory cy -
tokines, leptin, hyperinsulinemia, non-esterified fatty acids, 
angiotensinogen, baroreflex impairment, and obstructive sleep apnea 
[84]. 
Alterations in AChE activity: Obesity has been associated with 
changes in AChE activity. Some studies suggest that obesity may lead to 
increased AChE activity, potentially resulting in higher breakdown of 
acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in various functions, 
including memory and cognitive processes [85]. 
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is primarily associated with the break -
down of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in various physio -
logical processes, including muscle contraction, cognition, and memory. 
While the direct link between AChE and T2D, obesity is not well- 
established, there are some potential connections worth mentioning. 
3.3. Neurotoxicity induced by Aβ-AChE complex 
Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the selective death of neu -
rons, possibly caused by the accumulation of Aβ peptide and fibrils. 
AChE, a component of senile plaques, increases the formation of amyloid 
fibrils in the brain and Aβ-AChE complex is highly toxic [86,87]. Studies 
have shown that the Aβ-AChE complex induces neurotoxic effects in 
both in-vivo and in-vitro experiments. The brain of AD patients with 
excessive Aβ accumulates and precipitates in the form of insoluble am -
yloids, which cause neurotoxicity [88]. There is evidence of link be -
tween the Aβ-AChE complex and AD. The synaptic form of hAChE-S has 
been shown to be associated with plaques in AD brains. Only hAChE-S 
among human acetylcholinesterase variants has been reported to 
enhance Aβ fibrilization and deposition, as well as toxicity in in-vivo 
studies [89]. Transgenic mice models of hAChE-S/hAPPs have been 
used to study in-vivo implications of hAChE-S in AD pathology, and 
changes in cholinergic imbalance and neurotransmission have been 
observed in the presence of hAChE-S (double transgenic) [90]. Over -
expression of hAChE-S in transgenic mice has been reported to cause 
senile dementia symptoms, such as dendritic branching, reduced cortical 
neuron numbers, learning and memory impairment, and increased up -
take of high-affinity choline. Mature plaques in the cerebral cortex and 
Aβ were observed in hAChE-S, like AD. The presence of beta-helical 
forms and hAChE-S beta-sheet species in plaque cores was an impor -
tant finding, and studies in animals have shown that hAChE-S is present 
in the brain’s senile plaques [91,92]. 
3.4. Cholinergic system and AD 
The cholinergic hypothesis of AD has led to the development of 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for AD. These drugs pre -
vent the breakdown of acetylcholine, which increases the amount of 
available acetylcholine in the brain, thereby improving cholinergic 
neurotransmission and cognitive function. However, these drugs only 
provide symptomatic relief and do not modify the underlying disease 
process. Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor acting as a 
modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, enhancing cholinergic 
neurotransmission, and reducing amyloid beta levels [140]. It has been 
shown to improve cognition and activities of daily living in patients with 
mild to moderate AD [93]. 
Other potential targets for the treatment of AD include butyr -
ylcholinesterase, a cholinesterase enzyme that also breaks down 
acetylcholine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In addition, there 
is increasing interest in targeting the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptor, which has neuroprotective effects by modulating inflammation 
and synaptic plasticity in the brain [110]. 
Natural products such as curcumin, resveratrol, and green tea extract 
have also been investigated for their potential to modulate cholinergic 
neurotransmission and reduce amyloid beta levels [95]. These com -
pounds have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as it 
improves cognitive function in preclinical models of AD. However, 
clinical trials have not yet provided conclusive evidence of their efficacy 
in humans. Overall, the cholinergic system remains an important target 
for the development of new therapies for AD, both for its role in the 
pathogenesis of the disease and potential to improve cognitive function 
[96]. 
Several plant-based drugs like hyperforin and galantamine modulate 
ACh (acetylcholine) release in the central nervous system [136]. In-vivo 
studies showed the attenuation of amyloidal beta-induced spatial 
memory impairments and amyloidal beta neurotoxicity [138]. A de -
rivative of hyperforin is tetrahydrohyperforin (THH). In a double 
transgenic mouse model of AD, it increases the brain’s acetylcholines -
terase activity, lowers the levels of cholinergic indicators that are 
associated with oxidative stress, amyloid plaques, and death, and pro -
tects cholinergic neurons Fig. 5 [97,98]. 
3.5. Cholinergic system and Wnt signaling pathway in AD 
Wnt signaling pathway has been reported to play a critical role in the 
modulation of synaptic plasticity. Studies have shown that Wnt 
signaling regulates the clustering of ACh receptors (AChRs) at the 
neuromuscular junction, which is important for maintaining synaptic 
strength [93]. In addition, mutations in several components of the Wnt 
signaling pathway have been shown to induce impaired synaptic func -
tion, deficits in learning and memory, and accumulation of AChRs in 
C. elegans models [93]. These findings suggest that Wnt signaling is 
involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and the development of 
cognitive functions. Further research is required to fully understand the 
mechanisms of Wnt signaling pathway influencing synaptic plasticity 
and cognitive functions in AD [ [26,94,95]]. 
3.6. Location of human AChE gene at chromosome number 7 
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a protein that plays a critical role in 
the cholinergic system by breaking down the neurotransmitter acetyl -
choline Fig. 6. In addition to its role in cholinergic neurotransmission 
[100,101], AChE has non-cholinergic roles, including tumorigenesis, 
amyloid fibril assembly, hematopoiesis, and thrombopoiesis. AChE is 
encoded by a gene located on chromosome 7 in humans [15,101], and 
abnormalities in this gene have been associated with several diseases, 
including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The loss of cholinergic neurons and 
the accumulation of amyloid plaques containing AChE have been 
observed in AD patients, leading to the development of cholinesterase 
inhibitors as a pharmacological approach to treat AD by raising the level 
of acetylcholine. Ongoing research is exploring the role of AChE in 
modulation of cholinergic function in various neurodegenerative and 
neurodevelopmental pathologies [102]. 
4. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene 
The amyloid precursor protein is encoded by the APP gene, present 
in brain and spinal cord as well as other tissues. Its exact function is not 
well understood, but during the early stages of development, it plays a 
significant role to direct the migration of nerve cells. Enzymes break 
down the amyloid precursor protein into smaller peptides, including 
soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) pep -
tide, which are released outside the cell. Recent studies suggest that 
sAPP has growth-promoting properties and involve in the development 
of neurons in the brain, both pre- and post-birth. Additionally, the sAPP 
peptide has the potential to regulate other proteins by inhibiting their 
activity. The amyloid β peptide may also influence the capacity of 
neurons to change and adapt over time. Mutations in the APP gene, 
which has over 50 distinct variants, can lead to early-onset of 
K. Gajendra et al.

Alzheimer ’ s disease, which occurs before the age of 65 [ 103 ]. However, 
less than 10 % of early-onset AD cases are caused by these mutations. 
Mutations in the APP gene can lead to the amplification of the amyloid β 
peptide or the production of a slightly longer and stickier version of the 
peptide, both of which can accumulate in the brain and form amyloid 
plaques, a hallmark of AD [ 59 , 104 ]. 
4.1. Amyloidosis 
Amyloidosis is a pathological condition characterized by abnormal 
accumulation of amyloid in different tissues or organs. These proteins 
are typically stable, fibrous-like, insoluble and proteolytically resistant 
cross-beta super-20 structure. Amyloidosis can affect the normal 
functioning of tissues and cause changes in the body ’ s organs [ 105 ]. It 
can be inherited or acquired, and amyloid fibrils can accumulate 
throughout the body or in specific regions of a single tissue. Different 
types of amyloidosis are categorized based on the primary peptide or 
protein that makes up the amyloid fibrils and the clinical symptoms. In 
addition to the main fibrillar component, amyloidosis deposits may also 
contain minor non-fibrillar components such as glycosaminoglycans 
(GAGs), apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and serum amyloid P components 
[ 106 ]. To date, 28 distinct human proteins have been identified as 
amyloids, with AD being one such example [ 107 ]. 
The “ cholinergic hypothesis ” of AD was developed based on initial 
neurochemical findings in AD brains, suggesting the impairment of 
acetylcholine metabolism. This theory proposes that individuals with

Gajendra et al.

AD may have a reduction in cholinergic neurons in their brain or basal 
ganglia [ 108 ]. The accumulation of tau protein and amyloid-beta (A β ) 
has been linked to cholinergic projection deficits in AD patients. 
Compensatory mechanisms may lead to an increase in Na + -dependent 
high-affinity choline absorption, as AChE and choline acetyltransferase 
activities decrease. Pre-synaptic α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are 
critical for cognitive functions, and their levels increase and then 
decrease as AD progresses. Individuals with AD have lower levels of 
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in their brains. 
4.2. Amyloid plaque formation in AD 
Amyloid plaques are composed of oligomers of a peptide containing 
approximately 40 amino acids, known as A β , which is generated from 
the amyloid-beta precursor protein. This protein contains 695 amino 
acids and is a cell membrane-bound receptor that has the amyloid-beta 
sequence in its extracellular domain [ 109 ]. The production of A β in -
volves proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid-beta precursor protein by 
various secretases, leading to either an amyloidogenic or 
non-amyloidogenic pathway. Sorting nexin 17 (SNX17), an intracellular 
adaptor protein, chaperones A β as it travels to the membrane via 
endosomes, making it available for secretases to digest [ 110 ]. The initial 
proteolytic cleavage in the extracellular space by α -secretase produces 
soluble fragments, while β -secretase produces an insoluble fragment, 
determining the amyloidogenic pathway [ 111 ]. Cleavage of the β -am -
yloid precursor protein by α -secretase releases a soluble APP 
beta-protein (sAPP α ) into the extracellular space [ 112 ]. This creates two 
subsequent fragments of the β -amyloid precursor protein, intracellular 
domain (AICD) which are released into the cytosol and subsequently 
into the extracellular space [ 113 , 114 ]. 
4.3. Amyloidogenic pathway 
In the amyloidogenic pathway Fig. 7 β -site APP-converting enzyme 1 
(BACE1) cleaves β -amyloid precursor protein (APP) at β -site, producing 
a shorter soluble amyloid precursor protein- β (sAPP β ) fragment and a 
remaining C-terminal fragment of 99 amino acids. The C-terminal 
fragment is then cleaved by γ -secretase, releasing two fragments of AICD 
and A β . The A β peptide aggregates into oligomers and fibrils, leading to 
the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer ’ s 
disease [ 114 ]. 
4.4. Non-amyloidogenic pathway 
In the non-amyloidogenic pathway [ 115 ], APP is cleaved by α -sec -
retase before β -secretase, resulting in the release of sAPP α and the p3 
fragment, which is not involved in the formation of amyloid plaques. In 
contrast, in the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by β -sec -
retase, followed by γ -secretase, resulting in the release of the A β peptide, 
which can aggregate to form amyloid plaques [ 110 ]. The longer A β 
peptide is considered to be the major neurotoxic component, while the 
sAPP α released in the non-amyloidogenic pathway is believed to have 
neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. The balance between these 
pathways is crucial to maintain neuronal development and function. 
Any imbalance leads to the development of neurodegenerative disorders 
such as Alzheimer ’ s disease [ [ 105 , 112 , 114 ]]. 
5 . Altered A β -AChE complexes induce neuronal loss in AD 
Different molecular forms of AChE can exist, each with a unique 
expression pattern in various cell types and a distinct subcellular dis -
tribution, which likely reflects a specific physiological function of each 
form. There may be novel applications for AChE that are unrelated to 
cholinergic neurotransmission [ 115 ]. Both cholinergic and 
non-cholinergic brain regions contain AChE, but the functional impor -
tance of the non-cholinergic AChE is still unknown. The AChE species 
present in non-pathological and AD brains exhibit various characteris -
tics. Even in pathological areas, the decline of AChE activity in the AD 
brain is not solely due to cholinergic reduction, as the density of 
AChE-rich fibers decreases in cortical areas of AD patients but is not 
correlated with the number of AChE-rich neurons [ 116 , 117 ]. Thus, an 
alteration in AChE levels may not reflect a change in cholinergic 
neurotransmission in the brain region. Not all molecular forms of AChE 
are equally affected in the AD brain. While most studies on the two main 
AChE subtypes in the mammalian brain, tetrameric and monomeric 
species with altered G4/G1 molecular form ratios, focus on neuro -
chemical and neuroanatomical characteristics, the lighter species are 
conserved or even augmented in severely damaged cases of AD, whereas 
the G4 form is selectively lost in the AD brain. The AChE species that 
make up the majority of plasma forms are also more prevalent in AD 
plasma. Recent human investigations have demonstrated that AChE 
monomeric species are increased in the brains of transgenic mice 
(Tg2576) and the APPC100 mouse strain, which overproduces human 
A β in the brain. It has also been reported that amyloid-beta may have an 
impact on AChE [ 117 ]. AChE ’ s action on A β aggregation leads to the 
creation of amyloid fibrils. AChE serves as a seed or nucleation factor, 
and it is absorbed into the process of A β aggregation at every stage. It 
also contributes to the elongation of the amyloid fibrils. 
AChE act as a chaperone to facilitate the assembly of A β into oligo -
mers with more structural complexity, such as amyloid fibrils, by 
shortening the lag phase of peptide aggregation Fig. 8 [ 117 ]. There are 
two possible mechanisms by which AChE may function in this process: 
Fig. 7. Amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways [ 105 , 153 ].  
K. Gajendra et al.

firstly, by increasing the seeds needed for the nucleation step, and sec -
ondly, by inducing fibril elongation [ 87 ]. AChE activity becomes evident 
when the enzyme is closely associated with amyloid deposits. Senile 
plaques in the brain of AD patients were described by Mesulam and 
Geula [ 170 ]. Using electron microscopy and a monoclonal antibody 
coated with gold particles have shown the growing amyloid fibrils in the 
AD patient. It demonstrated, how a small portion of the enzyme becomes 
closely associated with the amyloid fibril [ 118 ]. 
5.1. Evidence showing AChE involvement in amyloid deposition 
The process of converting soluble A β into amyloid fibrils is 
nucleation-dependent and associated with the structural conversion of 
A β [ [ 4 , 12 , 119 ]]. In vivo studies have demonstrated the binding of AChE 
to A β , with AChE binding to A β -coated wells at levels five to six times 
higher than that observed with BSA-coated wells, as determined by 
ELISA testing [ 120 ]. Several in vivo investigations have shown that 
AChE promotes A β aggregation and amyloid fibril production. AChE 
also accelerates the deposition of A β [ 121 ]. Double-transgenic mouse 
model that overexpresses human APP and human AChE has shown the 
accumulation of larger plaques in transgenic mice compared to control 
animals, as well as cognitive impairment [ 122 ]. 
5.2. Modification in the expression and distribution of AChE in the AD 
brain 
Expression and distribution of AChE are altered in the brains with AD 
lesions [ 4 ]. Decreased AChE activity has been observed in the cortex, 
amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus basalis of Meynert, which are 
associated AD. Ratios of the altered forms of AChE changes with a 
decreased tetrameric globular G4 AChE form. Simultaneously mono -
meric Gi and asymmetric AChE forms are increased, although the latter 
typically make up a small portion of the total enzyme in the human 
brain. AChE co-localize with A β deposits in cerebral blood vessels, 
pre-amyloid diffuse deposits, and mature senile plaques [ 123 ]. The 
deposition of A β is a critical stage in AD-related neurodegenerative 
processes, and elements of senile plaques, including AChE, are likely to 
cause selective neuronal cell death, indicating a significant involvement 
in AD pathogenesis. In fact, the expression of AD is the primary 
distinguishing hallmark of degenerating neurons, and groups of neurons 
that do not possess choline acetyltransferase exhibit AD. The majority of 
cortical AD activity in the AD brain has likely accelerated A β ′ s accu -
mulation into amyloid fibrils, enhancing its toxicity [ 124 ]. 
5.3. The role of AChE in amyloid deposition in the AD brain 
Reduction of ACh production and alterations of A β -AChE complexes 
leads to neuronal death in AD, which is a major contributor to cholin -
ergic deficits in the brain [ 1 ]. These deficits, in turn affects AChR levels 
and lead to further downstream effects, including the synthesis of A β . It 
is believed that amyloidogenic process results from soluble A β -isoforms 
is relatively benign nucleation-dependent process as compared to A β 
aggregation into amyloid fibrils. This complex process involves multiple 
factors and pathways, and the understanding of its underlying mecha -
nisms remains an active area of research in AD [ 57 ]. 
5.4. Structural motifs of AChE in amyloid formation in AD patients 
Molecular dynamic methods have been used to simulate the binding 
of A β to catalytic subunit of AChE to identify the AChE motif that pro -
motes A β fibril production. This investigation identified four possible 
sites. Site I covering the primary hydrophobic sequence exposed on the 
surface of AChE. H peptide, a 3.4 kDa polypeptide [ 116 ], has been 
shown by turbidity data to accelerate the production of A β fibrils. This 
location ’ s ability to interact with cell membranes correlates with a hy -
drophobic AChE sequence. The AChE motif promoting A β fibril pro -
duction is located at the tryptophan, a conserved amino acid residue in 
the PAS (peripheral anionic site) of the catalytic subunit of AChE. The 
active site at the bottom should be accessible to both PAS and effective 
therapeutic AChE inhibitors. The latter site enhances catalytic efficiency 
by temporarily binding ACh until it AChEs the acylation site and serve as 
connections between AChE and A β . Ligands that bind to PAS show ef -
ficacy by speeding up processes towards the acylation site. The poly -
amine caproctamine, binding to the peripheral anionic site of AChE has 
been developed as a non-covalent inhibitor of AChE [ 116 ].

5.5. AChE-Aβ complexes increase the neurotoxicity of Alzheimer’s fibrils 
in vitro and in vivo 
AChE-Aβ complex fibrils is neurotoxic, similar to amyloid fibrils is 
toxic to neuronal cells in culture. To explore this, studies have been 
conducted in cell cultures and in vivo with AChE-Aβ complexes and Aβ 
aggregates [125]. AChE-Aβ complexes significantly affects the behavior 
of cells as compared to Aβ aggregates. Recent in vivo comparisons of the 
neuropathological changes caused by human Aβ fibrils and AChE-Aβ 
complexes in rat hippocampus indicates that AChE-Aβ complexes cause 
a more severe response than Aβ fibrils alone. In vitro research reports 
that AChE substantially increases rat Aβ aggregation, and in vivo in -
vestigations reports AChE-Aβ deposits, which attracted endogenous Aβ 
peptide [126]. Furthermore, the presence of neurons expressing laminin 
around the AChE-Aβ deposits in vivo suggests that these deposits recruit 
endogenous Aβ peptide. Recent study supports the idea that AChE-Aβ 
complexes are more toxic than Aβ fibrils and AChE is responsible for 
some of the neurodegenerative changes observed in AD brains by 
increasing Aβ deposition. These findings are supported by various in 
vivo and in vitro investigations [116,126–128]. 
5.6. Role of phytomedicine in AD 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common form of dementia character -
ized by memory impairment and neurological symptoms. The Food and 
Drug Administration has approved (synthetic medications) only a 
limited number of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, which include 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and 
rivastigmine) and N-methyl D-aspartate receptor blockers (memantine). 
However, these treatments are focused on a single target and only pro -
vide relief from symptoms rather than modifying the disease [18,129]. 
They are also known to have negative effects, including nausea, vom -
iting, diarrhea, headAChE, dizziness, fatigue, muscle spasms, and 
insomnia. However Herbal medicine is being increasingly explored as an 
alternative approach to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease 
[129]. Certain plants contain phytochemicals that can enhance brain 
function, and their antioxidant properties (including flavonoids, 
beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E) can potentially counteract 
oxidative stress, which is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology 
of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. New effective ther -
apeutic agents with fewer side effects are needed [129]. Although syn -
thetic medications are routinely used, herbal medicines have gained 
attention for their benefits and minimal side effects. This article reviews 
the therapeutic effects of phytomedicines in the prevention and treat -
ment of AD, with a focus on herbal remedies such as Lavandula angus -
tifolia, Ginkgo biloba, Melissa officinalis, Crocus sativus, Ginseng, Salvia 
miltiorrhiza, and Magnolia officinalis [ [18,129–131]]. The paper also 
discusses recent research on the protective and therapeutic effects of 
these herbal remedies on AD, and evaluates their potential as alternative 
treatments for the disease. 
6. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs 
Currently, the most commonly drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s dis -
ease are acetylcholinesterase/cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is). The 
first ChE-I to be approved for the symptomatic therapy of AD was 
tacrine, but it is no longer used due to hepatotoxicity. Currently avail -
able ChE-Is are donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine [130,131]. In 
addition, some natural phytocompounds such as Curcumin, Varenicline, 
Huperrtzine, Resveratrol, and Cycloastrageno have received FDA 
approval to treat Alzheimer’s disease (Table 1). 
6.1. Acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors from plants 
The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasing due to 
aging population, posing a significant threat to the health of elderly 
individuals. Despite the absence of an effective treatment for AD, 
pathophysiology of AD and potential therapeutic agents have been 
explored extensively. Natural products have gained significant attention 
due to their unique advantages. One such compound has the potential to 
become a multi-target drug by interacting with various targets related to 
AD [130,137]. Structural modifications can be made to enhance inter -
action and decrease toxicity. Hence, research on natural products and 
their derivatives for treating pathological changes in AD is crucial. The 
focus of most of the research discussed in this review is on natural 
compounds and their derivatives for AD treatment [88]. Natural prod -
ucts have been a focus of research for their potential as acetyl cholin -
esterase inhibitors (AChEIs), with several plant-derived compounds 
being identified as having AChEI activity [138]. Alkaloids are one of the 
most common groups of AChEIs found in plants, but other groups of 
compounds like sterols, flavonoids, terpenes, and glycosides have also 
been shown to inhibit AChE [139]. Some examples of natural products 
with AChEI activity include huperzine A, galantamine, physostigmine, 
and rivastigmine (Table 2). 
6.2. Clinical study 
Huperzine A and Galantamine have been used clinically to treat 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Both drugs are effective to treat age-related 
memory impairment or dementia, but its cognitive effects on patients 
with moderate AD are inconclusive [140,141]. Salvia officinalis L. has 
shown to improve cognitive performance in patients with mild to 
moderate AD and attenuate cognitive impairment in patients with 
moderate to severe AD [142]. However, long-term efficacy, safety, and 
Table 1 
FDA approved plant based anti-Alzheimer’s drugs 
It has been reported that the AChE inhibitor drugs, physostigmine and donepezil inhibit AChE and induce Aβ polymerisation in AD [121]. The AChE present in the 
AChE-Aβ complexes has shown properties similar to those of senile-plaque-associated AChE. In fact, the enzyme associated with Aβ peptide has demonstrated higher 
Km and Vmax values than those observed by free enzyme [132,133].

administration strategy require further investigation. Crocus sativus L. 
dried extract has also shown significant improvement in cognitive ca -
pacity in individuals suffering from mild-to-moderate AD, comparable 
to that observed in donepezil-treated patients [ 143 ]. 
6.3. Clinical trial of phytomedicines 
Phytomedicines have been used for medicinal purposes for centuries 
and are divided into four categories based on their origin and evolution. 
These medicines contain phytoconstituents that are known for their 
pharmacological effects on the body and are used globally. However, the 
lack of data on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines has led to 
insufficient regulation. Critics of phytomedicines have called for more 
clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy before they are 
accepted as evidence-based medicines. Clinical trials can only begin 
after the collection of relevant preclinical data and approval from rele -
vant health authorities/ethics committees [ 144 ]. 
The drug development process is a long, costly, and high-risk 
endeavour due to lack of clinical efficacy, unmanageable toxicity, 
poor drug-like properties, and lack of commercial needs. The complexity 
of biological systems, the narrow focus on drug targets, and the lack of 
robust biomarkers can all contribute to the high failure rate. To improve

the success rate, a more holistic understanding of disease biology, the 
development of more reliable biomarkers, collaborations between 
stakeholders, and the use of new technologies like artificial intelligence 
can all play a crucial role [145]. 
There have been several instances of phytomedicines showing 
moderate efficacy in clinical trials. One example is the herbal drug St 
John’s wort, which has been traditionally used to treat depression. 
However, a large-scale clinical trial conducted in 2002 found that St 
John’s wort did not show significant efficacy [146]. Another example is 
the herbal drug Echinacea, which is commonly used as a natural remedy 
for the common cold. However, a clinical trial conducted in 2005 found 
that echinacea was less effective in preventing or treating the common 
cold [147]. A third example is the herbal drug ginkgo biloba, which is 
commonly used to improve memory and cognitive function. However, a 
large-scale clinical trial conducted in 2008 found that ginkgo biloba was 
not significantly effective than a placebo in preventing cognitive decline 
in older adults [148]. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct non-clinical 
study and proceed with multi-centric double-blind place-control clinical 
trial to evaluate the efficacy. 
7. Recent developments and future perspectives 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex disorder with multifactorial 
pathogenesis. Various mechanisms have been linked to the development 
of AD, including inflammation, amyloid-beta, oxidative stress, dyslipi -
demia, diabetes mellitus, cholinergic pathways, Interleukin receptor- 
associated kinase 4 signaling pathway, and Wnt signaling pathways 
[173]. Nutritional changes and healthy lifestyles can reduce the risk of 
AD by reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, type 2 
diabetes, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation [174]. 
The cholinergic theory is based on the presynaptic deficits reported 
in AD patients, and few cholinomimetic medications might enhance 
cognitive performance. However, patient selection and consideration of 
side effects are crucial to determine the effectiveness of cholinomimetic 
therapy. FDA-approved medications like donepezil, galantamine, and 
rivastigmine are used to treat AD, but they only have improve the 
symptoms and do not prevent its progression [175]. 
Novel therapeutic drugs for AD must be thoroughly analysed for 
exact mechanisms before development. Effective AD medications 
require an understanding of how tau protein, AChE, and amyloid beta 
protein interact. Biomarkers such as Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 are effective 
biomarker for early AD prediction, and various diagnostic techniques 
such as MRI scanning, PET, and amyloid positron emission tomography 
are available for early AD diagnosis [176-178]. 
Drug designs must take into account for interaction of numerous 
pathways due to AD’s complex pathophysiology [179]. Immunotherapy 
is a potential treatment approach for Aβ clearance in the brain, but it is 
expensive, and there are several serious side effects, including stability, 
poor BBB permeability, and autoimmune response in the AD brain. 
Molecular clamps that bind to target sites like APP and phosphorylation 
sites in tau could lead to potential therapeutic medications to reduce 
enzymatic activity without impairing the enzymes’ other biological 
functions [180,181]. 
Overall, despite the complexity of AD, it is hopeful that new multi- 
targeted therapeutic medications will emerge to address the patho -
physiology of AD and provide effective diagnosis and treatment strategy 
for AD patients. 
8. Conclusions 
To summarize, there are differences in the response of acetylcho -
linesterase species to AD and their interactions with amyloid-β protein, 
and they also interact with different amyloid β-peptide fragments. 
Accelerating the fibrilization of amyloid-beta protein and exploring the 
alternative functions of acetylcholinesterase, it is important to study 
their association with different AChE species and variants, and their role 
in the pathogenesis of AD. Recent studies suggest that acetylcholines -
terase may play a role in the production of Aβ protein in the brain. To 
understand the physiological and clinical significance of altered AChE 
expression in the AD brain and the use of AChE inhibitor pharmaceutical 
treatments, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms. 
Currently, herbal and synthetic medications such as rivastigmine, 
donepezil, and galantamine are used as AChE inhibitors to treat AD, 
providing an alternative approach to alleviate symptoms. However, due 
to the lack of a cure for AD and the limited effectiveness of current drugs, 
there is potential in using phytomedicines or medicinal plant products to 
treat AD. Medicinal herbs and herbal drug preparations have been used 
to treat neurological disorders like AD, and research supports their use 
due to their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Phyto -
medicines containing flavonoids, polyphenols, and other naturally 
occurring antioxidants can cross the blood-brain barrier and protect 
neurons from oxidative stress associated with neurodegenerative dis -
eases. Moreover, compared to synthetic drugs, phytomedicines have 
fewer side effects and are more compatible with the human system. As a 
result, research has been increased significantly to exploring the po -
tential of phytomedicines to develop effective treatments for AD.

","The review discusses the role of cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, emphasizing natural products. It highlights various studies on plant-derived compounds such as flavonoids, terpenes, and steroidal alkaloids with potential anti-cholinesterase activity. The article also explores other therapeutic approaches including traditional Chinese medicinal plants, neuroprotective strategies, and the development of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. Additionally, it addresses recent advancements in AD diagnosis through blood-based biomarkers and the challenges in translating these findings into clinical applications.","Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD), the main dementia type accounting for over 70 % of the entire dementia population and exhibits progressive decline in memory and executive function. AD pathology is characterized by amyloid fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, consistently colocalizes with the amyloid deposits is characteristic of Alz -heimer ’ s disease and may contribute to the generation of amyloid proteins. AChE is a potent amyloid-promoting factor as compared with other associated proteins. AChE inhibitors play a vital role to prevent the formation of toxic oligomeric form of amyloid peptide. Recent studies have reported that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChE- Is) are present in plants, fungi, and marine products. Some cholinesterase inhibitors, obtained from plant source such as rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine, used in the treatment of AD, offer an alternative approach to alleviate its symptoms by reducing A β . Due to limited efficacy of currently available drugs for AD, there is huge potential of phytomedicines for the treatment of AD. Medicinal herbs and herbal drug preparations have traditionally been used to treat neurological disorders such as AD by exhibiting its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Phytomedicines con -taining flavonoids, polyphenols, and other naturally occurring antioxidants crosses the blood-brain barrier and protect neurons from oxidative stress. As compared to synthetic drugs, phytomedicines have fewer side effects. Therefore, recent research is focused to explore the potential of phytomedicines and develop it as effective treatment for AD. In our review, we summarized the pathology of AD, amyloid-deposition, role of Acetylcho -linesterase, potential of phytoconstituents with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity for AD treatment.","Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by ageing and selective loss of neurons leading to impairment of learning and memory [ 1 ]. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, and amyloid-beta peptide deposition around dystrophic reactive glial cells are neuropathological hallmarks in AD patients [ 2 ]. The primary component of senile plaques and significantly increased neurotoxin (amyloid-beta peptide) are linked to dysfunction of laminin, apolipo -protein E, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [ 3 , 4 ]. Co-localization of A β deposits with AChE has been observed in mature senile plaques, pre-amyloid diffused deposits, and cerebral blood vessels [ 5 , 6 ]. AChE activity in the AD brain is linked to the amyloid core of senile plaques, rather than the neuritic (senile plaques) [ 7 ]. Amyloidoses is a protein-misfolding disorders characterized by accumulation of insoluble fibrillar protein complexes in the extracellular component. There are 25 forms of human proteins and polypeptides as amyloid deposits, including the prion protein (PrP) and 39-43-residue amyloid peptide in AD [ 8 ]. Choline acetyltransferase is a single-strand globular protein that catalyzes the biosynthetic reaction of the acetylcholine neurotrans -mitter, while acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes acetylcholine into acetic acid and choline in the central nervous system (CNS) [ [ 5 , 9 – 11 ]]. Ma -jority of AChE molecules are present in tetrameric form AChE to neuronal cell membranes and involved in both cholinergic and non-cholinergic function in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Biochemical studies showed that neurotoxicity accelerated by AChE-A β complexes increases neurodegeneration as compared to amyloid- β peptides alone [ 11 ]. AChE catalytic activity is crucial for cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation [ 12 ]. Inhibiting the activity of the AChE enzyme increases acetylcholine level, which is essential for transmission between brain cells by breaking it down into acetylcholine in the brain [ 13 ]. In AD patients, cortical cholinergic function is compromised due to decreased cerebral choline acetyl -transferase production, which decrease the acetylcholine synthesis [ 14 ]. Several types of neurons deteriorate as AD progresses, however, fore -brain cholinergic neurons suffer a profound loss and accompanied by steady decline of acetylcholine. ChAT, the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, and AChE activity are vastly affected in AD [ 15 ]. Despite the overall decrease in the activity of AChE in the AD patient, current AD therapy mostly targets the inhibitors of AChE (AChE-I), which enhance cholinergic transmission, but have modest and transient therapeutic effects [ 16 ]. Although the distribution of AChE molecular forms spe -cifically affects the AD brain, the pathophysiological relevance and subsequent ramifications of these alterations in AChE enzyme remain unknown even though it has been known for almost 50 years. An increase in AChE enzyme levels is a hallmark of AD [ 17 ]. For Alzheimer ’ s disease treatment, only a few synthetic medications are approved by the FDA, and it provides only symptomatic relief and have more side effects. Phytomedicine has been explored as an alternative approach to alleviate Alzheimer ’ s symptoms [ 18 , 19 ]. Some plants contain phytochemicals (Curcumin, Resveratrol, Epigallocate -chin-3-gallate, Morin, Delphinidins, Quercetin, Luteolin) that enhances brain function and counteract oxidative stress. The therapeutic potential of herbal remedies, including Lavandula angustifolia, Ginkgo biloba , and Salvia officinalis has been shown to improve cognitive performance in mild to moderate AD [ 20 , 21 ]. Certain plants contain natural compounds that improve brain func -tion and fight oxidative stress. Herbal remedies like lavender, ginkgo biloba, and sage have been found to enhance cognitive abilities in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) [ 22 ]. These natural compounds may offer a new and effective strategy to treat AD and delay its onset. Some promising plant-based treatments are currently undergoing trials for AD. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) show promise for delivering therapies for neurodegenerative diseases worldwide because they can interact with cells effectively [ 23 ]. Researchers are also exploring vaccines as a new approach to treating AD [ 24 ], targeting key factors like tau protein and beta-amyloid plaques. Developing drugs that can target multiple aspects of the disease simul -taneously is becoming more important. Exosomes, tiny vesicles that can cross the blood-brain barrier, are being investigated for their potential to deliver treatments directly to the brain for conditions like AD [ 25 ]. Our review article provides an overview of Alzheimer ’ s disease, including its pathology, amyloid-deposition, and the role of acetylcholinesterase. It also highlights the potential of phytoconstituents with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity for the treatment of AD.","Different molecular forms of AChE can exist, each with a unique expression pattern in various cell types and a distinct subcellular distribution, which likely reflects a specific physiological function of each form. There may be novel applications for AChE that are unrelated to cholinergic neurotransmission [ 115 ]. Both cholinergic and non-cholinergic brain regions contain AChE, but the functional impor -tance of the non-cholinergic AChE is still unknown. The AChE species present in non-pathological and AD brains exhibit various characteris -tics. Even in pathological areas, the decline of AChE activity in the AD brain is not solely due to cholinergic reduction, as the density of AChE-rich fibers decreases in cortical areas of AD patients but is not correlated with the number of AChE-rich neurons [ 116 , 117 ]. Thus, an alteration in AChE levels may not reflect a change in cholinergic neuro transmission in the brain region. Not all molecular forms of AChE are equally affected in the AD brain. While most studies on the two main AChE subtypes in the mammalian brain, tetrameric and monomeric species with altered G4/G1 molecular form ratios, focus on neuro -chemical and neuroanatomical characteristics, the lighter species are conserved or even augmented in severely damaged cases of AD, whereas the G4 form is selectively lost in the AD brain. The AChE species that make up the majority of plasma forms are also more prevalent in AD plasma. Recent human investigations have demonstrated that AChE monomeric species are increased in the brains of transgenic mice (Tg2576) and the APPC100 mouse strain, which overproduces human A β in the brain. It has also been reported that amyloid-beta may have an impact on AChE [ 117 ]. AChE ’ s action on A β aggregation leads to the creation of amyloid fibrils. AChE serves as a seed or nucleation factor, and it is absorbed into the process of A β aggregation at every stage. It also contributes to the elongation of the amyloid fibrils. AChE act as a chaperone to facilitate the assembly of A β into oligo -mers with more structural complexity, such as amyloid fibrils, by shortening the lag phase of peptide aggregation Fig. 8 [ 117 ]. There are two possible mechanisms by which AChE may function in this process: firstly, by increasing the seeds needed for the nucleation step, and sec -ondly, by inducing fibril elongation [ 87 ]. AChE activity becomes evident when the enzyme is closely associated with amyloid deposits. Senile plaques in the brain of AD patients were described by Mesulam and Geula [ 170 ]. Using electron microscopy and a monoclonal antibody coated with gold particles have shown the growing amyloid fibrils in the AD patient. It demonstrated, how a small portion of the enzyme becomes closely associated with the amyloid fibril [ 118 ]. The process of converting soluble A β into amyloid fibrils is nucleation-dependent and associated with the structural conversion of A β [ [ 4 , 12 , 119 ]]. In vivo studies have demonstrated the binding of AChE to A β , with AChE binding to A β -coated wells at levels five to six times higher than that observed with BSA-coated wells, as determined by ELISA testing [ 120 ]. Several in vivo investigations have shown that AChE promotes A β aggregation and amyloid fibril production. AChE also accelerates the deposition of A β [ 121 ]. Double-transgenic mouse model that overexpresses human APP and human AChE has shown the accumulation of larger plaques in transgenic mice compared to control animals, as well as cognitive impairment [ 122 ]. Expression and distribution of AChE are altered in the brains with AD lesions [ 4 ]. Decreased AChE activity has been observed in the cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus basalis of Meynert, which are associated AD. Ratios of the altered forms of AChE changes with a decreased tetrameric globular G4 AChE form. Simultaneously mono -meric Gi and asymmetric AChE forms are increased, although the latter typically make up a small portion of the total enzyme in the human brain. AChE co-localize with A β deposits in cerebral blood vessels, pre-amyloid diffuse deposits, and mature senile plaques [ 123 ]. The deposition of A β is a critical stage in AD-related neurodegenerative processes, and elements of senile plaques, including AChE, are likely to cause selective neuronal cell death, indicating a significant involvement in AD pathogenesis. In fact, the expression of AD is the primary distinguishing hallmark of degenerating neurons, and groups of neurons that do not possess choline acetyltransferase exhibit AD. The majority of cortical AD activity in the AD brain has likely accelerated A β ′ s accu -mulation into amyloid fibrils, enhancing its toxicity [ 124 ]. Reduction of ACh production and alterations of A β -AChE complexes leads to neuronal death in AD, which is a major contributor to cholin -ergic deficits in the brain [ 1 ]. These deficits, in turn affects AChR levels and lead to further downstream effects, including the synthesis of A β . It is believed that amyloidogenic process results from soluble A β -isoforms is relatively benign nucleation-dependent process as compared to A β aggregation into amyloid fibrils. This complex process involves multiple factors and pathways, and the understanding of its underlying mecha -nisms remains an active area of research in AD [ 57 ]. Molecular dynamic methods have been used to simulate the binding of A β to catalytic subunit of AChE to identify the AChE motif that pro -motes A β fibril production. This investigation identified four possible sites. Site I covering the primary hydrophobic sequence exposed on the surface of AChE. H peptide, a 3.4 kDa polypeptide [ 116 ], has been shown by turbidity data to accelerate the production of A β fibrils. This location ’ s ability to interact with cell membranes correlates with a hy -drophobic AChE sequence. The AChE motif promoting A β fibril pro -duction is located at the tryptophan, a conserved amino acid residue in the PAS (peripheral anionic site) of the catalytic subunit of AChE. The active site at the bottom should be accessible to both PAS and effective therapeutic AChE inhibitors. The latter site enhances catalytic efficiency by temporarily binding ACh until it AChEs the acylation site and serve as connections between AChE and A β . Ligands that bind to PAS show ef -ficacy by speeding up processes towards the acylation site. The poly -amine caproctamine, binding to the peripheral anionic site of AChE has been developed as a non-covalent inhibitor of AChE [ 116 ]. AChE-Aβ complex fibrils is neurotoxic, similar to amyloid fibrils is toxic to neuronal cells in culture. To explore this, studies have been conducted in cell cultures and in vivo with AChE-Aβ complexes and Aβ aggregates [125]. AChE-Aβ complexes significantly affects the behavior of cells as compared to Aβ aggregates. Recent in vivo comparisons of the neuropathological changes caused by human Aβ fibrils and AChE-Aβ complexes in rat hippocampus indicates that AChE-Aβ complexes cause a more severe response than Aβ fibrils alone. In vitro research reports that AChE substantially increases rat Aβ aggregation, and in vivo in -vestigations reports AChE-Aβ deposits, which attracted endogenous Aβ peptide [126]. Furthermore, the presence of neurons expressing laminin around the AChE-Aβ deposits in vivo suggests that these deposits recruit endogenous Aβ peptide. Recent study supports the idea that AChE-Aβ complexes are more toxic than Aβ fibrils and AChE is responsible for some of the neurodegenerative changes observed in AD brains by increasing Aβ deposition. These findings are supported by various in vivo and in vitro investigations [116,126–128]. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common form of dementia character -ized by memory impairment and neurological symptoms. The Food and Drug Administration has approved (synthetic medications) only a limited number of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) and N-methyl D-aspartate receptor blockers (memantine). However, these treatments are focused on a single target and only pro -vide relief from symptoms rather than modifying the disease [18,129]. They are also known to have negative effects, including nausea, vom -iting, diarrhea, headAChE, dizziness, fatigue, muscle spasms, and insomnia. However Herbal medicine is being increasingly explored as an alternative approach to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease [129]. Certain plants contain phytochemicals that can enhance brain function, and their antioxidant properties (including flavonoids, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E) can potentially counteract oxidative stress, which is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. New effective ther -apeutic agents with fewer side effects are needed [129]. Although syn -thetic medications are routinely used, herbal medicines have gained attention for their benefits and minimal side effects. This article reviews the therapeutic effects of phytomedicines in the prevention and treat -ment of AD, with a focus on herbal remedies such as Lavandula angus -tifolia, Ginkgo biloba, Melissa officinalis, Crocus sativus, Ginseng, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and Magnolia officinalis [ [18,129–131]]. The paper also discusses recent research on the protective and therapeutic effects of these herbal remedies on AD, and evaluates their potential as alternative treatments for the disease. Currently, the most commonly drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s disease are acetylcholinesterase/cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is). The first ChE-I to be approved for the symptomatic therapy of AD was tacrine, but it is no longer used due to hepatotoxicity. Currently avail -able ChE-Is are donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine [130,131]. In addition, some natural phytocompounds such as Curcumin, Varenicline, Huperrtzine, Resveratrol, and Cycloastrageno have received FDA approval to treat Alzheimer’s disease (Table 1). The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasing due to aging population, posing a significant threat to the health of elderly individuals. Despite the absence of an effective treatment for AD, pathophysiology of AD and potential therapeutic agents have been explored extensively. Natural products have gained significant attention due to their unique advantages. One such compound has the potential to become a multi-target drug by interacting with various targets related to AD [130,137]. Structural modifications can be made to enhance inter -action and decrease toxicity. Hence, research on natural products and their derivatives for treating pathological changes in AD is crucial. The focus of most of the research discussed in this review is on natural compounds and their derivatives for AD treatment [88]. Natural prod -ucts have been a focus of research for their potential as acetyl cholin -esterase inhibitors (AChEIs), with several plant-derived compounds being identified as having AChEI activity [138]. Alkaloids are one of the most common groups of AChEIs found in plants, but other groups of compounds like sterols, flavonoids, terpenes, and glycosides have also been shown to inhibit AChE [139]. Some examples of natural products with AChEI activity include huperzine A, galantamine, physostigmine, and rivastigmine (Table 2). Huperzine A and Galantamine have been used clinically to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Both drugs are effective to treat age-related memory impairment or dementia, but its cognitive effects on patients with moderate AD are inconclusive [140,141]. Salvia officinalis L. has shown to improve cognitive performance in patients with mild to moderate AD and attenuate cognitive impairment in patients with moderate to severe AD [142]. However, long-term efficacy, safety, and administration strategy require further investigation. Crocus sativus L. dried extract has also shown significant improvement in cognitive ca -pacity in individuals suffering from mild-to-moderate AD, comparable to that observed in donepezil-treated patients [ 143 ]. Phytomedicines have been used for medicinal purposes for centuries and are divided into four categories based on their origin and evolution. These medicines contain phytoconstituents that are known for their pharmacological effects on the body and are used globally. However, the lack of data on the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines has led to insufficient regulation. Critics of phytomedicines have called for more clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy before they are accepted as evidence-based medicines. Clinical trials can only begin after the collection of relevant preclinical data and approval from rele -vant health authorities/ethics committees [ 144 ]. The drug development process is a long, costly, and high-risk endeavour due to lack of clinical efficacy, unmanageable toxicity, poor drug-like properties, and lack of commercial needs. The complexity of biological systems, the narrow focus on drug targets, and the lack of robust biomarkers can all contribute to the high failure rate. To improve the success rate, a more holistic understanding of disease biology, the development of more reliable biomarkers, collaborations between stakeholders, and the use of new technologies like artificial intelligence can all play a crucial role [145]. There have been several instances of phytomedicines showing moderate efficacy in clinical trials. One example is the herbal drug St John’s wort, which has been traditionally used to treat depression. However, a large-scale clinical trial conducted in 2002 found that St John’s wort did not show significant efficacy [146]. Another example is the herbal drug Echinacea, which is commonly used as a natural remedy for the common cold. However, a clinical trial conducted in 2005 found that echinacea was less effective in preventing or treating the common cold [147]. A third example is the herbal drug ginkgo biloba, which is commonly used to improve memory and cognitive function. However, a large-scale clinical trial conducted in 2008 found that ginkgo biloba was not significantly effective than a placebo in preventing cognitive decline in older adults [148]. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct non-clinical study and proceed with multi-centric double-blind place-control clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy."

1  |  INTRODUCTION
Glycogen synthase kinase-  3 (GSK3) was first identified in the 1980s 
as a protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating and deactivat -
ing glycogen synthase in rabbit skeletal muscle. 1,2 Since then, GSK3 
has been recognized as an evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr protein 
kinase with a multitude of substrates. To date, over 100 substrates 
of GSK3 have been identified, with an additional 500 awaiting con -
firmation. 3,4 This extensive range of downstream regulated effects 
renders GSK3 one of the most functionally complex kinases involved 
in various cellular processes, including motility, metabolism, differ -
entiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. 3 The two isoforms of human 
GSK3, GSK3 α, and GSK3 β,	consist	of	483	amino	acids	(51 kDa)	and	
420	amino	acids	(47 kDa),	respectively,	as	evidenced	by	research.5,6

Abstract
Glycogen synthase kinase-  3 (GSK3), consisting of GSK3 α and GSK3 β subtypes, is a 
complex protein kinase that regulates numerous substrates. Research has observed 
increased	GSK3	expression	in	the	brains	of	Alzheimer's	disease	(AD)	patients	and	
models.	AD	is	a	neurodegenerative	disorder	with	diverse	pathogenesis	and	notable	
cognitive impairments, characterized by A β aggregation and excessive tau phospho -
rylation. This article provides an overview of GSK3's structure and regulation, exten -
sively	analyzing	its	relationship	with	AD	factors.	GSK3	overactivation	disrupts	neural	
growth,	development,	and	function.	It	directly	promotes	tau	phosphorylation,	regu-
lates amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, leading to A β formation, and directly 
or indirectly triggers neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. We also summarize 
preclinical research highlighting the inhibition of GSK3 activity as a primary therapeu-
tic	approach	for	AD.	Finally,	pending	issues	like	the	lack	of	highly	specific	and	affinity-	
driven GSK3 inhibitors, are raised and expected to be addressed in future research. 
In	conclusion,	GSK3	represents	a	target	in	AD	treatment,	filled	with	hope,	challenges,	
opportunities, and obstacles.

These isoforms are derived from chromosome 19 and chromosome 
3, respectively. 6,7 Both GSK3 α and GSK3 β have been detected in 
almost all species, with over 90% similarity across different species. 8 
In	Homo	sapiens,	the	amino	acid	sequences	of	GSK3α and GSK3 β 
show 84%–85% similarity, while their kinase domains exhibit a high 
degree of homology, with 19 differential amino acids from the 285 
amino acids that make up the kinase domains ( Figure 1A), according 
to sequence alignment. 6,7 Though hitherto no accurate structural in -
formation of GSK3α	is	obtained.	Predicted	result	in	UniProt	(ht tps:// 
www. unipr ot. org/ unipr ot/ P49840# struc ture) suggests that the 
glycine- rich region distinguish between these two isoforms does not 
form a stable secondary structure. Hence, the secondary structures 
of GSK3 α and GSK3 β (Figure 1B) are also thought to be similar es -
pecially in kinase domains, which arrive at a conclusion that GSK3 α 
and GSK3β showed approximate biological activity. Nonetheless, re -
search confirms that the glycine-  rich region plays a role in localizing 
GSK3α inside the cell. 9 The wild-  type GSK3 α is typically situated in 
the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus, as stated in scholarly litera -
ture.7	Intriguingly,	research	indicates	that	truncated	GSK3α lacking 
the N- terminal region congregates in the nucleus, with calcium stim -
ulation further amplifying this effect. 10	In	contrast,	GSK3β displays 
greater nuclear mobility, particularly during the S-  phase of the cell 
cycle and in the context of apoptosis, as reported in studies. 11,12
Alzheimer's	disease	(AD)	is	a	neurological	condition	that	is	typ-
ified	by	cognitive	impairment	and	memory	loss.	It	is	the	foremost	
cause of dementia, and while it remains a growing concern, the 
ever- increasing number of patients coupled with slow drug devel -
opment	has	resulted	in	AD	becoming	a	condition	that	is	among	the	
most destructive, expensive, and burdensome. 13,14 For instance, 
in	the	United	States	alone,	it	has	been	estimated	that	the	cost	of	
AD	was	approximately	 $305 billion	 in	2020,	with	around	5.8 mil-
lion Americans affected. 15	In	view	of	latest	statistics,	it	can	be	an-
ticipated that the figure of affected individuals is likely to rise to 
13.8 million	by	2050.15 While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like 
donepezil and excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists such 
as	memantine	remain	the	preferred	treatment	options	for	AD,	it	
is	worth	noting	that	they	have	been	approved	by	the	U.S.	Food	
and	Drug	Administration	 (FDA)	for	multiple	 decades	 and	offer

only partial relief of symptoms. 16,17 Recently, another drug called 
Aduhelm (aducanumab), which is a monoclonal antibody that tar -
gets A β	(amyloid	beta),	has	received	 FDA	approval	 for	treating	
AD.18 However, there is still ongoing debate regarding its curative 
effectiveness. 19	Despite	exhaustive 	research,	there	exists	an	in-
complete understanding of the fundamental mechanisms at play 
in	AD.	Supported	by	characteristic	 pathological	markers	including	
the aggregation of A β and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles 
(NFTs), these factors are believed to be the primary contributors 
to	AD.13 Furthermore, observations of inflammation, 20 mitochon -
drial malfunction, oxidative stress, 21 autophagy impairment, 22 gut 
microbiota deregulation 23 and occurrences of ferroptosis 24 have 
all been documented in relation to the onset and progression of 
AD.	Above	all,	AD	is	a	highly	intricate	neurodegenerative 	disorder	
that requires ongoing exploration of therapeutic targets and drug 
development efforts. 13,14
High expression of GSK3 in the brain stands out as a signifi -
cant phenomenon compared to its expression in other tissues. 6 
This finding was first noticed in animal models at both mRNA and 
protein levels and subsequently mirrored in the human brain. 25,26 
Given its considerable expression levels, the role of GSK3 in normal 
brain physiology and neurological conditions such as bipolar disor -
der,	AD,	Parkinson's	disease,	and	psychiatric	disorders	has	become	
increasingly intriguing to researchers. 7 Taking into account the mul -
tifunctional nature of GSK3 and its relevance to several patholog -
ical	features	of	AD,	notably	the	formation	of	NFTs,27,28 significant 
attention has been devoted to GSK3 in the course of developing 
drugs	for	AD.29 The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively 
explicate	the	link	between	GSK3	signaling	and	AD,	and	to	summa-
rize	the	latest	advances	in	drug	development	for	AD	that	specif-
ically	target	GSK3.	Ultimately,	the	intention	is	to	supply	relevant	
guidance on basic research on GSK3 signaling and to chart potential 
directions	for	creating	AD	drugs	that	specifically	target	GSK3.
2  | THE FUNCTION AND REGULATION 
MECHANISM OF GSK3
2.1  |  The location and function of GSK3 in the 
brain
From a spatial perspective, the brain is the organ with the highest 
abundance of GSK3 in healthy adults. 6 However, from a tempo -
ral perspective, the content of GSK3 in the brain of mature rats is 
significantly higher than that of fetal rats and newborn rats. 30 This 
phenomenon is related to the important role of GSK3 in brain devel -
opment, while in the mature brain, GSK3 may primarily play a role 
as a maintainer of function. Research involving the transfection of 
primary neurons with shGSK3 has demonstrated significant axon 
growth inhibition. 31	In	cases	where	GSK3	is	specifically	eliminated	
in astrocytes, mice display excessive anxiety and anomalous social 
behaviors. 32	Additionally,	neural	progenitor	cells	from	GSK3	KO	
mice are prone to massive proliferation instead of differentiating 
into intermediate neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons. 33 
Meanwhile,	cortical	progenitor	cells	from	GSK3	KO	mice	exhibit	a	
disruption of radial migration and dendritic orientation. 34
Noteworthily, GSK3α and GSK3 β do not exhibit complete func -
tional equivalence. GSK3α	knockout	(KO)	mice,	for	example,	are	able	
to survive but have a shortened lifespan and male infertility.35–37 These 
mice also experience considerable abnormalities in cerebellum struc -
ture and demonstrate various mental disorders and behavioral defi -
cits, including increased emotionality, reduced depression-  associated 
behaviors, decreased social interaction and aggression, altered infor -
mation processing, and impaired long- term memory function.38	In	ad-
dition, GSK3α	KO	mice	exhibit	enhancements	in	glucose	and	insulin	
sensitivity, along with a reduction in fat mass.35,38
The GSK3 β gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in the 
production of a neuron-  specific long form called GSK3 β2.39 This 
isoform is enriched during brain development, 40,41 and plays a sig -
nificant role ( Figure 2A) in promoting neurodevelopment such as 
neurogenesis, 42,43 axon formation and growth, 30,31,44  synaptogene -
sis,45 dendrite development, and neuronal survival. 28 Furthermore, 
GSK3β is crucial for both the formation and maintenance of neuro -
nal polarity (Figure 2A).46	Mice	with	complete	KO	of	the	GSK3β gene 
exhibit evident structural and functional abnormalities in the brain, 
but they succumb to liver and heart dysfunction in the early em -
bryonic stage. 47,48 Heterozygous mice with GSK3 β	KO	can	survive	
into adulthood, yet they display reduced exploratory behavior, 49 
decreased aggression, 50 and impaired memory. 51 Furthermore, si -
lencing GSK3 β solely in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus leads 
to an antidepressant-  like state in mice. 49,52,53
There are also differences in the spatial distribution of GSK3 β 
and GSK3 α in the brain. The Allen Brain Atlas shows that GSK3 β 
is expressed relatively evenly throughout the brain regions, 25,54 
while GSK3 α is only significantly expressed in the adult brain cor -
tex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum. 6 To sum up, although 
GSK3 plays a crucial role in the generation and development of the 
brain, the levels of GSK3α/GSK3β are tightly regulated both spatially 
and temporally. The distinct distribution of GSK3 α and GSK3 β in 
the brain is likely associated with their functional differences. An 
experiment using mutant mice with GSK3 α and GSK3 β mutations 
demonstrated that GSK3 α plays a more critical role than GSK3 β in 
hippocampal bidirectional synaptic plasticity. 55 The dysregulation of 
GSK3 is indeed a key contributing factor to various neurological dis -
orders, making the maintenance or restoration of GSK3 homeostasis 
an important subject of research in the field of neurological diseases.
2.2  |  Regulation of the GSK3 activity
As a protein kinase, GSK3 possesses the ability to phosphorylate 
almost all downstream proteins that bear the S/T-  X- X- X- S/T(P) 
motif, as evidenced by numerous substrates. 4,56  To date, crystal 
structures of GSK3 β have been acquired, mainly due to its shorter 
sequence. These structures serve as the foundation for GSK3 β's 
phosphate-  primed substrate specificity and autoinhibition. 57

It	is	anticipated	 that	GSK3α operates in a comparable manner. 4 
As shown in Figure  1D, the specific motif leads to a functional 
conformational change in GSK3, allowing substrate binding and 
phosphorylation. 4,58,59  A groove adjacent to the catalytic pocket 
plays a crucial role in recognizing and accommodating S/T from 
the specific motif, and is therefore named the substrate binding 
pocket. 57,58	It	is	important	to	note	that	the	groove	discussed	is	
significant for two exact opposite states of GSK3 β, namely p-  
GSK3βSer9  and p-  GSK3βTyr216. This is illustrated in Figure  1D, 
where Ser9 phosphorylation results in an inhibited state of GSK3 β 
by altering the position of the loop and occupying the substrate 
binding pocket with the phosphorylated Ser9, thereby preventing 
GSK3β and substrates from binding. 60 This phosphorylation state 
is crucial for maintaining normal cell homeostasis. 61	In	contrast,	
phosphorylation of Tyr216 activates GSK3 β as the side chain of 
Tyr216 occupies the substrate binding pocket prior to phospho-
rylation and releases it after phosphorylation. 58,62  The states of 
p- GSK3αSer21  and p-  GSK3αTyr279 reflect the inhibited and acti -
vated state of GSK3 α, respectively, and although no direct evi -
dence from structural biology is available, the identical inhibited 
and activated state suggests a similar phosphorylation regulatory 
mechanism for these two isoenzymes. 62,63
Not only catalyzing many substrates, GSK3 is under dynamical 
regulation of various of kinases as well ( Figure 1C). Ser21/9 can be 
phosphorylated by protein kinase B (PKB), commonly known as AKT, 
as well as its highly homologous proteins protein kinase A (PKA) 
and	protein	kinase	C	(PKC),	along	with	Integrin-	linked	kinase	(ILK),	
p70S6K, and p90RSK. 7,64 Additionally, two subfamilies of mitogen- 
activated	protein	kinase	(MAPK),	extracellular	signal-	regulated	ki-
nases (ERK) and p38, play a role in the phosphorylation of Thr43, 
Ser389, and Thr390, which results in GSK3 β Ser9 phosphoryla -
tion.65,66 The activating kinases of GSK3 β have been previously doc-
umented to perform the crucial function of phosphorylating GSK3 β 
at Tyr216. Specifically, Src, Fyn, and Pyk2 have been identified as 
the kinases responsible for this activation process. 7	In	addition,	it	
should be highlighted that GSK3β is also capable of performing auto-
phosphorylation at Tyr216. 67	Of	note,	Ser21/9	dephosphorylation	is	
also reported for GSK3 activity regulation, protein phosphatase 2A 
(PP2A) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) have been identified as the 
key enzymes involved in this process. 68
3  | THE ROLE OF GSK3 IN AD
There is a wealth of evidence that supports a strong correlation be -
tween	GSK3	and	AD.	Studies	have	shown	that	inhibiting	the	state	of	
GSK3β, specifically p-  GSK3βSer9, is beneficial for long-  term memory 
formation.69 Through the identification of genes and cerebrospinal 
fluid	biomarkers	in	hundreds	of	AD	patients	and	healthy	volunteers,	
it has been revealed that genetic variants of GSK3 β are closely as -
sociated with A β and p-  tau.70	Moreover,	high	activity	of	GSK3β in 
the	peripheral	blood	of	AD	patients	has	been	found	to	be	positively	
correlated with the severity of dementia. 71 Animal models have pro -
vided similar insights, as both the content and activity of GSK3β were 
observed to increase with age. 72–74	In	a	CamKIIα- tTA/GSK3β mouse 
model, where GSK3β	was	overexpressed	starting	at	6 months,	neuro-
degeneration	and	other	AD	symptoms	were	observed	at	12 months	
of age.75 Further mechanistic studies have revealed that the exces -
sive	activity	of	GSK3	influences	the	onset	and	progression	of	AD	
through various pathways.

3.1  |  Impairment of the neuronal 
structure and function
Given the complex biological functions of GSK3 and its precise 
regulation, the dysregulation of GSK3, especially the excessive ac -
tivation	in	AD	patients	or	animal	models,	can	have	multiple	nega-
tive effects on neurons ( Figure  2B). Researchers have activated 
GSK3 in model animals using different methods, and although 
the focus and specific indicators observed may vary, they have all 
discovered similar abnormalities in neuronal structural and func -
tional processes. Abnormal neuronal proliferation and maturation 
processes, as well as resulting dendritic atrophy, have been found 
in	CamKIIα- tTA/GSK3β mice. 76 Similarly, rats carrying the GSK3 β 
mutant with Ser9 mutated to Ala experience sustained activa -
tion of GSK3 β, leading to significant disruptions in neuronal os -
cillations in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal ventral side. 77 
Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 β can promote 
neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice. 78
Specifically, GSK3 overexpression or excessive activation also 
damages substructures within neurons, such as synapses, dendrites, 
and axons. GSK3 β overexpression can inhibit synaptogenesis. 79	In	
rats with elevated GSK levels caused by exogenous or endogenous 
factors, the presynaptic active zone, postsynaptic density, and syn -
aptic cleft are all negatively affected, accompanied by long-  term 
potentiation (LTP) inhibition. 80 LTP inhibition and related synaptic 
damage are direct causes of memory impairment. 81–83 Excessive ac-
tivation of GSK3 β	in	STZ-	induced	sporadic	AD	rats	ultimately	leads	
to decreased dendritic spine density and axonal thinning in the hip -
pocampal CA1 region. 84	In	AD	mouse	models	exposed	to	Aβ oligo-
mers, excessive GSK3 β activation is accompanied by dendritic spine 
loss.85 Axonal transport function is also severely impaired by GSK3 
overactivation, leading to excessive accumulation of p-  tau in the dis-
tal	axon	and	impaired	axonal	transport	of	KIF1A	(an	essential	protein	
for the delivery of neurotrophic factors), both contributing to the 
development	of	AD.86–89
In	terms	of	mechanisms,	based	on	the	existing	reports,	the	inter-
action between presenilin 1 (PS1) and GSK3 appears to be a crucial 
factor.	PS1	serves	as	a	significant	biomarker	of	AD	and	has	been	
demonstrated to be associated with the incidence of the disease, 
being	utilized	for	establishing	AD	animal	models	through	genetic	
mutations.90 Phosphorylation of PS1 by GSK3 β weakens its interac -
tion with N- cadherin/β- catenin, resulting in the formation of trimeric 
complexes at synapses and a decrease in synaptic plasticity and 
neuronal vitality. 91	Mice	with	PS1	deficiency	or	mutations	display	in-
creased GSK3 β activity, leading to notable axonal transport impair -
ments.	Mechanistically,	GSK3β is involved in the augmented release 
of	membrane-	bound	organelles	driven	by	kinesin-	I.92 Furthermore, 
excessive activation of GSK3 β increases the phosphorylation level 
of	collapsin	response	mediator	protein	2	(CRMP2),	which	hinders	
CRMP2	signal	transduction	and	its	regulation	of	axonogenesis	and	
synaptic formation. 93,94
GSK3 is a critical participant in the β- catenin- dependent Wnt 
signaling pathway. 95 The pathway is known to have a significant 
impact on synaptic plasticity as well as memory. 96 The Wnt family is 
comprised of 19 lipid- modified glycoproteins and plays a crucial role 
in a range of cellular processes including cell metabolism, cell fate 
determination, polarity, and cytoskeleton alterations. The activa -
tion of the β- catenin- dependent Wnt signaling pathway involves the 
binding of Wnt to various cell surface receptors such as Frizzled (Fz), 
low- density lipoprotein receptor-  related protein 5 (LRP5), and LRP6, 
ultimately triggering β - catenin to exert its biological effects. 95 GSK3 
is a vital regulator of β - catenin degradation, and it forms a complex 
with	casein	kinase	Iα	(CKIα), Axin, and adenomatosis polyposis coli 
(APC) to phosphorylate β - catenin. Subsequently, E3 polyubiquitin 
ligases recognize the phosphorylated β- catenin, and it is degraded 
by	proteasome.	Upon	activation	of	Wnt	signaling,	the	complex	is	
eliminated, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized β - catenin, thus as a tran -
scriptional coactivator that translocates to the nucleus to promote 
transcription of related genes. 95 Wnt- dependent protein degrada -
tion is a common occurrence in cells when GSK3 dysfunction mani -
fests. GSK3's involvement in the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway aggravates 
AD-	associated	neuron	damage.97
Following an evaluation of gene expression in the prefrontal cor -
tex	of	both	normal	brains	and	AD	patients,	it	was	observed	that	the	
protein levels and activities of β- catenin and GSK3 β underwent a 
dynamic switch. These proteins are associated with Wnt signaling 
and	suggest	that	such	signaling	is	significantly	impaired	in	AD	pa-
tients.98 Further research has indicated that overexpression of the 
Wnt	antagonist	Dickkopf-	1	(Dkk-	1)	in	the	hippocampus	can	lead	
to a reduction in learning and memory ability in mice. This effect 
was linked to synapse loss, LTP impairment, and long-  term depres -
sion enhancement. However, the negative consequences were 
eliminated through associative inhibition of GSK3 and RhoA- Rock. 
Repression	of	Dkk-	1	expression	displayed	a	similar	effect.99	Overall,	
GSK3β plays a negative role in Wnt signaling- based neural functional 
recovery. Notably, activating muscarinic receptors inhibited GSK3 β 
and restarted the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway in A β1- 40- managed hippo-
campal neurons and glutamate-  managed PC12 cells. This process 
helped protect neurons from serious damage. 100,101
3.2  |  Tau pathology
Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein that contains 85 phospho -
rylation sites, with over 50 of these sites having been identified as 
being phosphorylated. 102 The protein is predominantly expressed 
in neurons, where it exists in six primary isoforms. 103 The process 
of phosphorylation, a posttranslational modification, is essential 
for the biological function of tau, which tracks axonal microtubules 
and enhances their stability, thereby contributing to axonal growth 
and transportation. 104 However, hyperphosphorylated tau has been 
implicated in the formation of intracellular NFTs, a typical patho -
logical	characteristic	of	the	brains	of	AD	patients.105 Consequently, 
phosphorylated tau (p-  tau) is recognized as a reliable biomarker 
for	AD	diagnosis	and	is	also	considered	a	promising	target	for	AD	
treatment.106

GSK3 is a kinase of significant importance for p- tau, with approx-
imately 30 serine or tyrosine residues from tau identified as poten -
tial phosphorylation sites for GSK3. 107	It	has	also	been	observed	that	
GSK3's phosphorylation of tau is correlated with the formation of 
tangle- like filament morphology. 108	Importantly,	recent	studies	illus-
trate that GSK3 β can directly acetylate the K15 site of tau protein, 
which has the negative consequence of inhibiting the ubiquitination 
degradation process and reducing its activity-  inhibiting state (p- 
GSK3βser9), ultimately causing GSK3 β to become excessively acti -
vated.109	In	essence,	a	detrimental	cycle	appears	to	have	developed	
between tau pathology and GSK3 over-  activation in the brains of 
AD	patients.
A	meta-	analysis	conducted	on	studies	related	to	AD	involving	the	
use of 3 ×Tg-	AD	mice	found	a	positive	correlation	between	Morris	
water	maze	(MWM)	performance	 and	p-	tau	levels.	Additionally,	
p- GSK3βSer9 was identified as the primary contributor. 110 Further 
research involving GSK3 α deficiency mice suggested that GSK3 α 
also played a role in tau hyperphosphorylation. 111 AChE inhibitors, 
such	as	donepezil,	remain	the	frontline	treatment	for	AD,	scientific	
investigators	have	discovered	that	in	AD,	AChE	is	colocalized	with	
p- tau in neurofibrillary tangles. They have also found that GSK3 β- 
induced tau hyperphosphorylation suppressed the expression of 
AChE. Clinical studies involving the use of irreversible GSK3 β in -
hibitors	have	reported	a	35 ± 16%	increase	in	AChE	activity	among	
patients.112 Here we introduce the exacerbation of tau pathology by 
GSK3 signaling mediated by various biomacromolecules and micro-
molecules (Figure 3).
3.2.1 | PI3K/AKT-	mediated	GSK3	signaling	in	
tau pathology
The AKT enzyme is responsible for transferring the phosphate group 
to Ser21/9 of GSK3, thereby inhibiting excessive activation of GSK3 
and	maintaining	the	stability	of	p-	tau.	It	has	been	established	that	
AKT is initially phosphorylated and activated by phosphoinositide 
3-	kinase	(PI3K).113	Therefore,	it	is	widely	believed	that	the	PI3K/
AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tau phosphoryla -
tion.6	Various	upstream	factors	influencing	PI3K	or	AKT	may	also	
partly affect tau phosphorylation through GSK3, which to some 
extent explains the interplay between neuroinflammation, neuronal 
apoptosis, and GSK3-  mediated tau pathology.
C- reactive protein, an immunomodulatory protein upregulated 
during inflammatory responses, induces tau phosphorylation in con -
junction with alterations in AKT/GSK3 β.114 The excessive phosphor -
ylation	of	tau	induced	by	the	inflammatory	cytokine	IL-	1β serves 
as a hallmark of the association between inflammation stimulation 
and	tau	pathology	in	AD.	The	phosphorylation	capability	of	AKT	on	
GSK3β is nullified by the sulfhydration of AKT at Cys77, which is 
contingent on elevated levels of intracellular hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) 
provoked	by	IL-	1β. This phenomenon leads to tau hyperphosphor -
ylation and synaptic dysfunction. 115	Interestingly,	a	separate	study	
demonstrated that exogenous administration of H 2S can directly 
sulfhydrate GSK3 β, resulting in decreased tau phosphorylation. 116 
Thus, it is evident that high levels of H 2S have a dual impact on 
AKT/GSK3- mediated tau pathology. Therefore, in an inflammatory

ZHAO et al.
environment, whether AKT is cysteinylated or GSK3 is cysteinylated 
by H2S, which one takes precedence, is a thought-  provoking ques -
tion worthy of further exploration. The caspase family proteins, 
crucial proteases in cellular apoptosis, play essential roles in vari -
ous biological processes in the nervous system. 117,118 Tau serves as a 
substrate for cysteine proteases, and caspase-  cleaved tau has been 
detected	in	the	AD	brain	but	not	in	the	normal	brain.	Importantly,	
caspase- cleaved tau exhibits higher fibrillogenicity compared to full-  
length tau. A combination of phosphorylation events and caspase 
activation	contributes	to	the	process	of	tau	oligomerization	in	AD.119 
GSK3β- mediated tau phosphorylation precedes caspase cleavage. 
Additionally, caspase-  3, a member of the caspase family, relieves the 
inhibition of GSK3 β by cleaving AKT, thereby increasing the occur -
rence of phosphorylation events. 119,120
Impairment	of	insulin	signaling	in	the	brain	has	been	associated	
with	AD.	Overexpression	of	Regenerating	islet-	derived	1α (REG- 1α) 
in	the	brains	of	AD	patients	triggers	tau	phosphorylation	through	
the AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway. 121	Mice	with	neuron-	specific	in-
sulin	receptor	(NIR)	KO	exhibit	activation	of	the	PI3K/AKT/GSK3β 
signaling pathway and significant tau pathology. 122	Overexpression	
of Phospholipid Transfer Protein (PLTP) in 3 ×Tg-	AD	mice	alleviates	
various	AD	symptoms	by	limiting	excessive	activation	of	GSK3β and 
tau	hyperphosphorylation	through	the	PI3K/AKT	pathway.123,124 
Metabotropic	Group	I	glutamate	receptors	(mGluRs)	can	influence	
PI3K/AKT,	resulting	in	reduced	GSK3β- mediated tau hyperphos -
phorylation. 125 The aforementioned proteins involve cellular signal 
transduction and intracellular and extracellular substance exchange. 
While a few studies have observed changes in their levels associated 
with	alterations	in	the	PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway, this phe-
nomenon is likely the result of multiple factors influencing it, such 
as insulin signaling, lipid transport, and metabolism. The underlying 
mechanisms by which these factors ultimately impact tau pathology 
through GSK3 β remain to be elucidated.
3.2.2 | A β- mediated GSK3 signaling in 
tau pathology
The investigation of the correlation between A β and tau has been a 
consistent	area	of	focus	in	research	on	AD.126 GSK3 serves as a cru -
cial element in receiving stimulation from A β and promoting tau pa -
thology.127 The research on the interaction between A β and tau, as 
well as the role of GSK3 within it, primarily revolves around the con -
formation of Aβ. Aβ1- 42 monomers, as opposed to oligomers, induce a 
PHF- like conformation of tau, resulting in multiple effects on tau, in -
cluding phosphorylation, conformational changes, and degradation, 
while simultaneously elevating GSK3 levels. 128	It	is	worth	noting	that	
Aβ1- 42 oligomers can also promote GSK3-  mediated tau pathology, 
with solubility being a crucial prerequisite. 129 A β1- 42 oligomers can 
bind with tau to form soluble stable complexes, enhancing the possi -
bility of tau receiving phosphoryl groups from GSK3β.130 Additionally, 
Aβ1- 42 oligomers exhibit high affinity binding with GSK3 α, thereby 
promoting GSK3 α- catalyzed tau phosphorylation. 117 These findings 
confirm the interrelationship between A β, tau, and GSK3, although 
certain details still require further investigation. For instance, if A β 
can bind to both tau and GSK3 α, does that imply the formation of a 
complex	involving	all	three	proteins?	Does	the	binding	of	Aβ to tau 
facilitate GSK3 β- mediated phosphorylation of tau, and does GSK3 β 
exhibit a similar strong interaction with A β as GSK3α does?
In	addition	to	directly	binding	to	tau	and	promoting	its	phosphor-
ylation by GSK3, the regulatory role of A β in GSK3 activity is equally 
significant. The indirect pathway of A β, mediated through norepi -
nephrine α2A adrenergic receptor ( α2AAR) signaling, surpasses 
direct GSK3 β activation in terms of potency, 127 underscoring its 
crucial	role	in	the	pathogenesis	of	AD.	The	cerebral	neurons	exhibit	
widespread distribution of α 2AAR, playing a pivotal role in trans -
mitting norepinephrine signaling. 118 Aβ oligomers have the potential 
to bind to α 2AAR and induce conformational changes, redirecting 
norepinephrine signaling towards GSK3 β activation, thereby exac -
erbating tau hyperphosphorylation. 127	Moreover,	Aβ also activates 
GSK3 and intensifies tau pathology through the promotion of ade -
nylate kinase 1 (AK1) and double-  stranded RNA-  dependent protein 
kinase (PKR).131,132
Aβ	also	enhances	the	expression	of	E2F1	and	c-	Myb,	which	ac-
tivate PAX6, a transcription factor linked to brain development and 
overexpressed	in	AD	patients	and	animal	models.	PAX6	promotes	
GSK3β transcription and elevates the p-  tau level at Ser356, Ser396, 
and Ser404. Besides, blocking PAX6 signaling partially mitigates 
Aβ- induced neuronal death. 133 Besides phosphorylation, A β also en-
hances tau accumulation via GSK3 β/SC35 signaling, which activates 
tau exon 10 splicing and increases intranuclear distribution. 134,135
The role of A β1- 42 in driving GSK3-  mediated phosphorylation of 
p- tau has been extensively acknowledged. The non-  amyloidogenic 
degradation pathway product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), 
known as sAPP α,	exhibits	a	protective	effect	on	AD	pathophysiol-
ogy by inhibiting GSK3 β and reducing tau phosphorylation, 136,137 
suggesting that other intermediate products of APP processing 
merit further attention in relation to their association with GSK3.
3.2.3 | AMPK- 	mediated	GSK3	signaling	in	
tau pathology
Recent	studies	have	indicated	that	AMP-	activated	protein	kinase	
(AMPK)	serves	as	a	crucial	regulator	of	bioenergy	metabolism	and	
plays	a	significant	role	in	AD.138	In	various	animal	models	of	AD,	low	
AMPK	activity	has	been	detected,	while	artificially	increasing	AMPK	
expression or activity has been found to ease tau hyperphospho -
rylation. Notably, GSK3 β agonists wortmannin have been found to 
limit	the	positive	effects	of	AMPK	on	AD,	emphasizing	the	pivotal	
role of GSK3β	in	AMPK-	mediated	suppression	of	p-	tau.139	Moreover,	
research has revealed that memory impairment and tau hyperphos -
phorylation were observed in type-  2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) 
KO	mice	with	lower	activity	of	AMPK	alongside	higher	activity	of	
GSK3β.139	In	contrast,	selective	activation	of	CB2R	was	found	to	
limit GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation; however, this

protective	effect	was	lost	when	AMPK	was	simultaneously	inhib-
ited.140	To	summarize,	the	activation	of	AMPK	inhibits	GSK3β ap -
pears to be the primary mechanism by which CB2R mitigates tau 
pathology. Adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes, has 
been found to function as an euglycemic agent. 141 Long-  term adi -
ponectin deficiency has been associated with the induction of tau 
pathology	and	other	AD	pathologies.142	Mechanistically,	adiponec-
tin	triggers	AMPK	phosphorylation,	 leading	to	the	up-	regulation	
of p-  AKT and p-  GSK3βSer9.142 Hence, adiponectin can effectively 
restrict	tau	hyperphosphorylation	through	the	AMPK/AKT/GSK3β 
signaling pathway. However, it is noteworthy to mention that cer -
ebral hypoglycemia has also been known to trigger tau pathology via 
the	same	signaling	pathway,	namely	AMPK/AKT/GSK3β.143
3.2.4 | GSK3	signaling	mediated	by	other	proteins	
in tau pathology
In	addition	to	the	above	few	signaling	pathways	or	stimuli,	there	
are numerous proteins that have been reported to directly or indi -
rectly affect GSK3-  mediated tau pathology. Firstly, there is a class 
of	proteins	that	have	been	found	to	be	abnormally	expressed	in	AD	
patients	or	AD	animal	models,	including	Deficiency	in	G	protein-	
coupled receptor- 5 (GRK5), Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), 3- β- Hydr
oxysteroid- Δ-	24-	reductase	(DHCR24),	Sirtuin	6	(SIRT6),	regulator	of	
calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), Cystatin C, and beta-  2 adrenergic receptors 
(β2ARs). Researchers have discovered the abnormality of GSK and 
p-	tau	during	the	investigation	of	their	roles	in	AD.	However,	there	
is currently a lack of evidence to directly support their involvement 
through the modulation of GSK3 expression or activity. Therefore, 
further mechanistic research is still required as substantiating evi -
dence.	Deficiency	in	G	protein-	coupled	receptor-	5	(GRK5)	has	been	
linked with mild cognitive impairment. 144	In	GRK5	KO	mice,	over-
activation of GSK3 β and tau hyperphosphorylation were observed, 
thus providing additional evidence of GRK5's inhibitory effect on 
GSK3β.145 Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) transgenic mice showed 
a striking pathological phosphorylation of tau, with upregulated p- 
GSK3βTyr216 and downregulated p-  GSK3βSer9 indicating that GSK3 β 
was the immediate cause of p-  tau.146	Increased	expression	of	p44,	
a short isoform of p53, has been found to elevate the risk of tau 
pathology.147	Moreover,	haploinsufficiency	for	p73,	a	member	of	the	
p53 family, has demonstrated a similar phenomenon. 148 Several ki -
nases, among them GSK3 β, have been implicated in p44/p73- related 
tau pathology. 3-  β- Hydroxysteroid- Δ-	24-	reductase	 (DHCR24),	an	
enzyme that converts desmosterol to cholesterol, has been found 
to	be	down-	regulated	in	individuals	with	AD.149	Its	levels	are	closely	
associated with caveolin-  1, an intrinsic membrane protein that is re -
sponsible for structuring caveolae leading to a key role in PP2A phos-
phorylation	site	localization.	DHCR24	has	been	shown	to	promote	
the activity of PP2A, resulting in increased levels of p-  GSK3βTyr216 
and p-  tau.150	Sirtuin	6	(SIRT6),	a	“longevity	gene”	that	optimizes	
energy homeostasis, is underexpressed in aging-  related diseases 
such	as	AD.151	SIRT6	KO	mice	have	exhibited	significant	AD-	like	
symptoms and tau hyperphosphorylation caused by GSK3 activa -
tion.152	In	patients	with	AD,	the	continuous	overexpression	of	the	
regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) has been observed to result in the 
downregulation of Calcineurin, an essential phosphatase that cata -
lyzes tau dephosphorylation. Furthermore, RCAN1 has been found 
to induce GSK3 β- catalyzed tau hyperphosphorylation. 153 Cystatin 
C has also been observed to be upregulated in the brains of both 
AD	patients	and	model	animals,	and	its	overexpression	in	neurons	
has been shown to accelerate tau phosphorylation by impeding the 
turnover of GSK3 β.154 A similar increase in beta-  2 adrenergic recep -
tors (β2ARs) has also been observed, and their stimulation has been 
found to influence GSK3 β	and	Cyclin-	dependent	kinase	5	(CDK5)	in	
contributing to tau pathology. 155,156
Another major category of proteins, known as receptors, have 
the ability to perceive incoming signals and regulate cellular func -
tions in response to signal stimulation. Several types of receptors 
have been reported, and their activation or inhibition ultimately in -
fluences GSK3-  mediated tau hyperphosphorylation. The observa -
tion	was	made	that	the	activation	of	M1	receptors	in	3×Tg-	AD	mice	
led to a decrease in GSK3β	activity	and	p-	tau	levels.	It	was	also	noted	
that	administration	of	an	M1	antagonist	noticeably	aggravated	the	
pathologic phosphorylation of tau. 157	Based	on	these	findings,	M1	
receptors were believed to play a critical role in the regulation of 
GSK3β and p-  tau. Furthermore, the Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptor (nAChR) was found to be involved in the regulation of cal -
cium channels, which, when activated, could mitigate tau hyper -
phosphorylation via GSK3 β,158 while the inhibition of the histamine 
H3 receptor was shown to relieve GSK3 β- related pathologic phos -
phorylation of tau. 159 Complement C3 receptor has been reported 
to promote GSK3 β activity, while its inhibition has been proven to 
alleviate tau hyperphosphorylation catalyzed by GSK3 β.160 The nu -
clear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) is recognized 
for its positive impact on synaptic plasticity and memory forma -
tion.161 Nonetheless, excessive expression of NR4A1 may activate 
GSK3β which can subsequently result in tau hyperphosphoryla -
tion.162 Chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) is a well-  established inflam -
mation marker that undergoes upregulation, and CC chemokine 
receptor 3 (CCR3) is the receptor for CCL11 found in hippocampal 
neurons.163,164 CCR3/CCL11 has been associated with elevated p- 
tau levels, and GSK3 β plays a partial role in this mechanism. 164
Other	proteins	that	influence	GSK3-	mediated	tau	pathology	
exert their effects through mechanisms that primarily involve direct 
binding to GSK3 or affecting the interaction between GSK3 and tau, 
as well as directly impacting the phosphorylation activation of GSK3, 
and so on. Studies have suggested that both GSK3 β and tau bind to 
the same region of PS1, thereby promoting the enzymatic effects 
of GSK3 β in phosphorylating its substrate, tau. 165 Furthermore, 
the	key	tau	kinase,	CDK5,	is	generally	activated	by	the	protein	p35.	
However, the p35 calpain cleavage product, p25, has a higher prefer-
ence for binding to and activating GSK3 β	compared	to	CDK5,	which	
leads to the phenomenon of p-  tau enhancement. 156,166 Nedd8 ulti -
mate	buster	1	(NUB1)	is	a	protein	that	is	induced	by	interferon	and

ubiquitin- proteasome system.167	Research	indicates	that	NUB1	has	
multiple functions in regulating tau pathology, including the aggre-
gation	and	phosphorylation	of	tau.	Importantly,	NUB1	promotes	the	
degradation of GSK3 β and also impedes the interaction between 
GSK3β and tau. 168 Axin restricts the interaction between GSK3 β 
and tau, which prevents GSK3 β from pathologically phosphorylating 
tau.169 The programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death 
1	ligand	1	(PD1/PDL1)	has	established	prominence	in	cancer	ther-
apy.170	Recent	studies	unearthed	a	PDL1-	GSK3β immune complex 
within the brains of APP/PS1 and 5×FAD	mice,	an	entity	that	height-
ens GSK3β activity and p-  tau levels.171
The	preceding	paragraph	has	indicated	the	potential	of	ILK	to	
augment the inhibitory effects on GSK3. 7	In	N1E-	115	neuroblastoma	
cells,	inactivation	of	ILK	led	to	the	loss	of	its	inhibitory	effect	on	
GSK3β, which subsequently caused an elevation in p-  tau levels. 172 
The previous paragraph has also explained the role of GSK3 in the 
Wnt/β-	catenin	pathway.	In	aged	rats,	inhibited	Wnt	signaling	by	
Dkk-	1	decreased	PP2A	activity	and	increased	GSK3β activity, which 
resulted in excessive tau phosphorylation at multiple sites in the 
hippocampus. 173 Pin 1 is a promising target for cancer therapy. 174 
However,	the	inhibition	of	Pin1	in	AD	amplifies	GSK3β activation 
and tau hyperphosphorylation. 175	It	has	also	been	reported	that	
GSK3β affects the proportions of different isoforms of tau mRNA 
through alternative splicing. Prion protein PrPC serves as an up -
stream regulator that inhibits GSK3 β activation. 176 Furthermore, 
interferon-	gamma	(IFN-	γ) initiates cellular immunity and triggers tau 
hyperphosphorylation via GSK3β signaling. 177
3.2.5 | MiRNA- 	mediated	GSK3	signaling	in	
tau pathology
In	brain	tissues	of	AD	patients,	there	is	a	reduced	content	of	miR-	
219- 5p, which has a negative correlation with both GSK3 β and tau- 
tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1). 178 The 3 ′ untranslated region of GSK3 β 
mRNA and TTBK1 mRNA share a base sequence of 5′-	GACAAUC-	3′, 
which can bind with miR-  219- 5p, thereby inhibiting the expressions 
of GSK3 β (instead of the phosphorylation of GSK3 β) and TTBK1, 
as well as the hyperphosphorylation of tau. 178 The most significant 
miRNA	decrease	observed	in	AD	patients'	neurons	is	miR-	132,179,180 
whose down-  regulation is closely linked to the pathological pro -
cesses	of	AD,	such	as	the	formation	of	NFTs.181	Mechanistically,	
miR- 132 can regulate the expression and various post-  translational 
modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, and 
limit the phosphorylation of tau through its negative role in both 
the transcription and translation of GSK3 β.179 The phenomenon of 
decreased	miR-	23b-	3p	has	been	observed	in	the	plasma	of	AD	pa-
tients,	cortex	of	APP/PS1	mice,	brain	of	SAMP8	mice,	and	SH-	SY5Y/
APPswe	cells.	Delivery	of	miR-	23b-	3p	into	the	ventricles	of	APP/
PS1	mouse	brains	can	improve	their	cognitive	deficits,	alleviate	AD	
pathology, and especially reduce tau phosphorylation at multiple 
sites.	Mechanistic	studies	indicate	that	miR-	23b-	3p	mainly	exerts	its	
effects by reducing the levels and activity of GSK3 β.182	Moreover,	
the LncRNA nuclear paraspeckles assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) 
facilitates the transcription of frizzled class receptor 3 (FCR3), thus 
limiting the phosphorylation of tau by GSK3 β.183
3.2.6 | Micromolecules	and	other	stimulus	
mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology
Inducers	of	disease	models,	environmental	pollutants,	and	certain	
physical factors like noise pollution are all significant contributors to 
tau	pathology	that	cannot	be	overlooked.	The	link	between	AD	and	
diabetes is widely recognized, with GSK3 playing a crucial role. 7,184 
Glucocorticoids, the key hormone responsible for raising blood glu -
cose levels, have also been reported to activate GSK3 β, elevate p- 
tau levels, and impair memory in db/db mice. 185 As an inducer of 
sporadic	AD	models,	STZ	is	frequently	used	in	the	modeling	of	both	
AD	and	diabetes	mellitus.186 Experiments have shown that STZ 
can	stimulate	tau	hyperphosphorylation	through	the	PI3K/AKT/
GSK3 signaling pathway. 186,187 Rotenone, a renowned compound 
extracted	from	Derris	known	for	its	ability	to	induce	apoptosis,	is	
also	frequently	employed	in	the	establishment	of	PD	models,	has	
been demonstrated to elevate p-  tau levels through the activation 
of GSK3β.188
Methamphetamine	abuse	often	leads	to	dementia,	and	experi-
mental evidence has shown that methamphetamine contributes to 
tau hyperphosphorylation through the AKT/GSK3β signaling path -
way.189 Cypermethrin, a pesticide, can up-  regulate GSK3 β.	Initially,	
cypermethrin blocks the heparin-  binding epidermal growth factor 
(HB- EGF) signaling pathway, which results in neuroinflammation. 
The	excessive	generation	of	IL-	1	ultimately	increases	the	levels	of	
GSK3β and p- tau.190 Furthermore, 3- Nitropropionic acid triggers the 
mitochondrial origin of oxidative stress, while excessive activation of 
GSK3β and tau hyperphosphorylation were also observed in the hip -
pocampus and cortex of mice exposed to 3-  nitropropionic acid. 191
Prolonged exposure to arsenic can elevate GSK3 β activity and 
exacerbate tau hyperphosphorylation in SH-  SY5Y cells, while multi -
ple GSK3β inhibitors can alleviate the effects of arsenic. 192 Plumbum 
exposure can also lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, with the ac -
tivation of GSK3 β	and	CDK5	being	the	declared	pathogenesis.193 
Furthermore, iron accumulation can increase the activities of GSK3 β 
and	CDK5,	thereby	worsening	tau	pathology.194 Paricalcitol can alle -
viate	iron	accumulation	by	activating	the	vitamin	D	receptor	(VDR),	
thus down-  regulating p- GSK3βTyr216 and ultimately preventing hy -
perphosphorylation of tau at Ser396 and Thr181 sites. 195	Intranasal	
administration of deferoxamine produces similar effects on GSK3 β 
and tau. 194 Chronic noise exposure has also been linked to tau pa -
thology, with PP2A/GSK3 β being under-  regulated.196	Interestingly,	
B- vitamin deficiency has been found to exhibit a similar function 
as noise.197	Moreover,	stress	responses	such	as	electric	shocks	and	
ether anesthesia can exacerbate the pathologic phosphorylation of 
tau via GSK3β.198,199
These studies suggest the crucial significance of maintaining a 
healthy	lifestyle	in	preventing	the	occurrence	and	progression	of	AD

symptoms.	It	is	also	advisable	for	AD	patients	to	eliminate	or	mini-
mize negative neurostimulants such as environmental pollutants and 
drugs while undergoing treatment. Nevertheless, further research is 
still required to substantiate the direct association between these 
stimulating factors and GSK3-  mediated tau pathology. This is be -
cause, based on existing research, their impact on the nervous sys -
tem is intricate and potentially irreversible, with GSK3-  mediated tau 
pathology likely representing just one of the most overt pathological 
outcomes.
3.3  |  Amyloid pathology
Just like GSK3 is associated with other typical pathological fea -
tures, amyloid pathology is also known to be linked with it. This 
pathology occurs due to an accumulation of A β, which is cleaved 
from its precursor protein APP. APP is an integral membrane 
protein that is abundantly expressed in the synapses of neurons 
and plays vital roles in synapse formation and repair, anterograde 
neuronal transport, and iron export. 200 There are three isoforms 
of APP that mainly concentrate in different tissues or cells. These 
isoforms are named APP 695, APP751, and APP770, based on the num -
ber of amino acid residues. The shortest isoform, APP 695, lacks a 
Kunitz- type protease inhibitor sequence in the ectodomain and is 
the most abundant in brains and neurons. 200,201  However, APP 751 
and APP770 are expressed more abundantly in platelets and periph -
eral cells. 200
It	should	be	noted	that	not	all	cleavage	processes	of	APP	lead	to	
the production of A β.	Depending	on	whether	or	not	Aβ is produced, 
cleavage processes can be classified into non-  amyloidogenic path -
ways and amyloidogenic pathways. Figure  4 shows that in the non- 
amyloidogenic pathway, APP is firstly cleaved by α- secretase to form 
sAPPα and α- C terminal fragment (CTF α).200	Unlike	Aβ, sAPPα plays 
crucial roles in neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity related learning 
and memory, 136 and it is produced more along with increased neu -
ronal activity. 202 CTF α can be further cleaved to P3 and the APP 
intracellular	domain	(AICD),	catalyzed	by	γ- secretase.200 The amyloi-
dogenic pathway, on the other hand, involves β - secretase instead of 
α-	secretase.	In	this	pathway,	APP	is	initially	cleaved	by	α- secretase 
to form soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPP β) and β- C ter-
minal fragment (CTF β). The γ - secretase also catalyzes CTF β cleav -
age,	leading	to	the	generation	of	AICD.	However,	under	further	
processing by γ- secretase at multiple sites, 40 amino acid A β1- 40 and 
the 42 amino-  acid A β1- 42 are ultimately generated. 200 These highly 
neurotoxic peptide fragments are the inducers of amyloid pathology. 
Therefore, it is significant to reduce A β generation by suppressing 
β- secretase and γ- secretase activities. Additionally, activating α - 
secretase could be helpful.
GSK3β is involved in various stages of Aβ formation, both directly 
and indirectly. These stages include its impact on APP expression, 
phosphorylation, lysosomal degradation, as well as its influence on 
α- secretase, β- secretase, and γ- secretase (Figure 4). The association 
between GSK3 activation and A β pathology has been observed in 
numerous	cellular	or	animal	models.	CDK5	knockdown	in	3×Tg-	AD

mice	executed	at	the	age	of	15 months,	showed	significant	reduction	
in amyloid plaques. The activation of GSK3 β and PP2A was declared 
to be the primary reason. 203 The author of this report primarily fo -
cuses	on	the	association	between	CDK5	and	GSK3β.	Unfortunately,	
the direct cause of GSK3 β activation leading to the formation of am -
yloid	plaques	in	this	one	of	the	most	classic	AD	animal	models	has	
not been thoroughly investigated. Nevertheless, GSK3 β siRNA was 
employed to knockdown GSK3 β in STZ- induced, in vitro and in vivo 
models	of	AD.	The	remarkable	outcomes	were	overcome	down-	
regulation of A β in cell models and mitigation of A β accumulation 
in	the	cortex	and	hippocampus	of	animal	models.	Inhibition	of	APP	
and β- secretase 1 (BACE1) by GSK3 β siRNA was found to be the 
crucial factor contributing to this phenomenon. 204 Conversely, inhi -
bition of β- secretase was observed to stimulate GSK3 β and intensify 
tau hyperphosphorylation. 205 Senescence- accelerated prone mouse 
strain	8	(SAMP8)	mouse	model	is	a	form	of	rapid	aging	animal	models	
associated	with	cognitive	impairment.	In	SAMP8	mice,	the	modifica-
tion	of	the	PI3K/AKT	pathway	gradually	activated	GSK3β with age. 
Ultimately,	both	β- secretase and γ- secretase were activated, lead -
ing to an increase in the levels of A β1- 40 and A β1- 42 in platelet and 
hippocampi. 206
Hence, the impact on β - secretase and γ- secretase appears to 
be crucial in linking GSK3 with A β pathology, and several litera -
ture reports provide strong evidence supporting this inference. As 
a kinase of glycogen synthase, the over-  activation of GSK3 is one 
of the causes of glucose metabolism disorder leading to diabetes. 
Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are toxic substances gen -
erated in the body after long-  term hyperglycemia. 7 Receptor for 
AGEs (RAGE) had been established to contribute to amyloid pathol -
ogy. GSK3β and p38 were identified as the connecting links between 
RAGE signal and A β. Gene silencing of RAGE curtailed GSK3 β and 
ameliorated A β accumulation, accompanied by attenuated activities 
of β- secretase and γ- secretase.207 Through the association of T-  cell 
factor- 4 with the BACE1 promoter, the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway 
could	impede	BACE1	transcription.	It	must	be	noted	that	the	GSK3	
inhibitor propelled Wnt signaling and concurrently repressed BACE1 
transcription. 208
The transcriptional expression, phosphorylation, and degra -
dation processes of APP also exert an influence on the ultimate 
accumulation of A β, wherein GSK plays a significant role. When 
comparing gene expression between normal people, patients with 
mild	cognitive	impairment,	and	AD	patients,	GSK3β expression was 
positively linked to the expression of Amyloid beta precursor protein 
binding family B member 2, 209 a transcription activator of APP. 210 
In	an	inflammatory	milieu,	astrocytes	have	the	potential	to	transmit	
CK1 to neurons via extracellular vesicles, which finally exacerbates 
the formation of amyloid plaques, where GSK3 has a definitive func -
tion.	More	specifically,	in	response	to	the	stimulation	of	IL-	1β, astro-
cytes secrete extracellular vesicles that envelop CK1. Then, after the 
transfer of CK1 to neurons, it engages in a complex with APC and 
GSK3, which obstructs the degradation of β - catenin. Consequently, 
this escalates the level of APP mRNA and in turn, intensifies the co- 
localization	of	BACE1	and	APP.	In	essence,	GSK3	is	instrumental	
in regulating APP expression and amyloid processing through this 
pathway.211 Suppressing GSK3 β also diminished APP phosphory -
lation,212 which might change the APP cleavage process and stop 
Aβ production. 213 Besides, restraining GSK3 fostered the nuclear 
translocation of the transcription factor EB, thereby enhancing the 
number of lysosomes, which ultimately improved APP autophagic 
degradation, consequently curtailing A β level.214 Apart from curbing 
Aβ accumulation, GSK3 β also influenced the sensitivity of the hippo -
campus towards A β.	It	was	found	that	the	voluntary	running	of	mice	
prevented their hippocampal network from disturbance caused by 
Aβ, and this defense was dependent on the inhibition of GSK3 β.215
3.4  |  Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation
Efforts have been made in recent decades to alleviate amyloid pa -
thology	and	tau	pathology	in	AD,	but	drug	development	progress	has	
been slow.216 Therefore, researchers have also shown great interest 
in other pathogenesis, such as oxidative stress and neuroinflamma -
tion	in	AD.	Elevated	reactive	oxygen	species	(ROS),	mitochondrial	
dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis are common phe -
nomena	observed	in	AD	patients	or	animal	models,	thus	character-
izing oxidative stress. 21	Inflammation,	as	indicated	by	the	high	levels	
of inflammatory cytokines TNF-  α,	IL-	6,	and	others	found	in	AD	pa-
tients'	serum	and	brain,	has	also	been	linked	to	AD.	The	alteration	
of immune cells, such as reactive astrocytes, T cells, and particularly 
activated	microglia	in	the	brain	of	AD	patients,	explains	the	occur-
rence of inflammation at the cellular level. 217
The role of GSK3 in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation 
has been implicated in its known substrate nuclear factor erythroid 
2- related factor 2 (Nrf2), a significant transcription factor that re -
sponds	to	environmental	stimuli,	particularly	elevated	ROS.218 Nrf2 
transfers from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to perform its biolog -
ical functions. The dimerization of the transcriptional co-  activator 
sMaf	stabilizes	Nrf2	in	the	nucleus,	allowing	it	to	interact	with	
Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) to enhance transcription of 
various genes ( Figure 5),	such	as	heme	oxygenase-	1	(HO-	1),	NAD(P)
H:quinone	oxidoreductase	1	(NQO1),	superoxide	dismutase	(SOD),	
etc.219
As a sophisticated regulator, the content of Nrf2, particularly the 
content in the nucleus, is tightly controlled by the ubiquitination sys -
tem. Kelch- like ECH- associated protein 1 (Keap1) functions to con -
catenate Nrf2 and Cul3- Rbx1, a ubiquitin ligase complex, ultimately 
leading to ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2.220 However, Keap1 
is not the only ubiquitination process involved in Nrf2 degradation. As 
shown in the Figure 5, another ubiquitin ligase complex, β- TrCP- Cul1, 
is also responsible for Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation. Crucially, 
when p- GSK3βY216 phosphorylates Nrf2, it greatly promotes the neg-
ative regulatory process of Nrf2. 218 Therefore, suppressing GSK3 β is 
considered	a	promising	therapeutic	strategy	for	AD	due	to	its	Nrf2	
activation effect. For example, an antisense oligonucleotide of GSK3β 
that reduced the level of GSK3β	in	the	cortex	of	SAMP8	mice	also	ex-
hibited Nrf2 activation and improved learning and memory abilities.221

ZHAO et al.
GSK3	has	also	been	found	to	be	involved	in	the	muscarinic	M1	
receptor-	induced	Nrf2	accumulation	in	the	nucleus.	Overexpression	of	
the	M1	receptor	in	PC12	cells	enhanced	the	level	of	Nrf2,	activated	the	
antioxidant response element (ARE), and facilitated the transcription 
and	translation	of	HO-	1.	GSK3β(Δ9) nullified the Nrf2- regulated oxida-
tion while GSK3β(Y216F) had little to no effect on it.222
The activity of Nrf2 is closely linked with inflammation, largely 
due to its crosstalk with NF-  κB, a well-  known regulator of inflam -
mation.223 As shown in Figure 5,	excessive	production	of	ROS	would	
facilitate multiple steps of NF-  κB activation, which also relies on 
upstream	regulatory	factor	IKKα ubiquitination and degradation. 223 
Although there is currently no evidence of GSK3 involvement in 
IKKα ubiquitination, the collective suppression of GSK3 β and NF- 
κB has been observed in some cells and animal models. 224,225 For 
instance, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a promising target for 
inflammatory	and	AD	treatment.226	Inhibiting	sEH	in	Aβ1- 42 induced 
AD	mice	was	found	to	stabilize	epoxyeicosatrienoic	acids,	a	series	of	
compounds	with	anti-	inflammatory	properties.	Interestingly,	a	high	
level of p- GSK3βSer9, accompanied by Nrf2 activation and NF-  κB in-
hibition, was also observed. 227
From the perspective of signaling pathways, the Nrf2 and NF-  κB 
signaling pathways are crucial for the neuroinflammation caused by 
excessive	activation	of	GSK3.	Meanwhile,	from	the	perspective	of	
neural cells, both microglia and astrocyte activation have been found 
to	be	associated	with	GSK3.	Microglia,	which	are	resident	immune	
cells in the brain, release a large amount of inflammatory factors after 
M1	polarization	in	pathological	conditions.	Similarly,	activated	astro-
cytes can also release inflammatory factors and chemokines to attract 
microglia into the damaged area. A β1- 42 induces neuronal apoptosis 
and releases phosphatidylserine, thereby activating microglia and pro-
moting neuroinflammation. The GSK3/Wnt signaling pathway plays a 
crucial	role	in	this	process,	inhibiting	PI3K/AKT	to	activate	GSK3β and 
facilitate microglial activation. 228	A	low	level	of	DHCR24	was	accom-
panied by GSK3β activation and hyperphosphorylation of tau.149,150	In	
addition	to	tau	pathology,	overexpression	of	DHCR24	in	BV-	2	cells	re-
versed the microglia polarization trend induced by A β25- 35.	Increased	
levels	of	arginase-	1,	IL-	4,	and	TGF-	β,	and	decreased	levels	of	iNOS,	
IL-	1β, and TNF-  α	reflected	that	DHCR24	promoted	M2	polarization	
of microglia, playing an anti- inflammatory role. The key mechanism is 
the activation of AKT and thereby the inhibition of GSK3 β.229 GSK3β 
is also involved in microglial activation via phosphorylation of astro -
cyte	CCAAT	enhancer-	binding	protein	delta	(CEBPD),	a	well-	known	
participant in inflammation-  related diseases. 230	In	astrocytes	of	AD	
patients, excessive activation of the calcium-  activated potassium 
channel	KCa3.1	was	observed.	In	LPS-	induced	neuroinflammation	
mice,	the	KO	of	KCa3.1	protected	neurons	and	alleviated	cognitive	
impairment.	KCa3.1	deficiency	mice	showed	activation	of	the	PI3K/
AKT pathway, suppression of GSK3 β, and inhibition of NF-  κB sig -
naling.231	Moreover,	in	vitro	cultures	of	various	glial	cells	extracted	
from	rat	cortex	released	various	inflammatory	factors	including	IL-	1β, 
FIGURE 5 Effects	of	GSK3 β on cellular oxidative stress and inflammation via Nrf2 and NF-  κB. Activated GSK3 β phosphorylates Nrf2, 
ultimately leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, the reduced levels of Nrf2 weaken the transcriptional expression 
of	cellular	antioxidant	enzymes,	resulting	in	excessive	accumulation	of	ROS.	Excessive	ROS	triggers	the	degradation	of	I κBα, leading to 
the release of NF-  κB (p65 and p50) into the nucleus, thereby upregulating the transcriptional expression of pro-  inflammatory factors and 
exacerbating inflammation. However, the direct impact of GSK3 β	on	IKK	and	IκBα remains uncertain.

TNF- α,	and	IL-	10,	which	were	significantly	decreased	by	different	
GSK3 inhibitors.232
3.5  |  Mitochondrial dysfunction
Mitochondria	serve	as	the	primary	sites	for	cellular	energy	metabo-
lism. The brain, being the most metabolically active organ, relies on the 
abundant ATP produced through mitochondrial oxidative phosphoryl-
ation.	In	the	brain	of	AD	patients,	noticeable	alterations	occur	in	both	
the structure and function of mitochondria, including changes in glu -
cose and oxygen metabolism due to respiratory chain dysfunction, as 
well	as	accumulation	of	ROS	and	mutations	in	mitochondrial	DNA.233
Under	 oxidative	 stress	 conditions,	 GSK3β translocates from 
the cytoplasm to the mitochondria in a kinase activity and voltage-  
dependent	anion	channel	2	(VDAC2)-	dependent	manner.	This	process	
is associated with increased cell death and can be blocked by GSK3 β 
inhibitors.234 Studies have demonstrated that GSK3 β inhibition can 
enhance mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, while al -
tering	NAD(P)H	metabolism.	These	metabolic	effects	are	associated	
with the increased stability of PGC-  1α protein, enhanced nuclear lo -
calization, and increased co-  transcriptional activation. This suggests 
that the GSK3β/PGC- 1α axis may play an important role in maintaining 
neuronal metabolic integrity.235	Dynamin-	related	protein	1	(Drp1)	is	a	
key protein involved in mitochondrial division and is highly expressed 
in neuronal cells. Research has shown that GSK3 β can induce the 
phosphorylation	of	Drp1,	resulting	in	mitochondrial	fragmentation	
and increased neuronal sensitivity to A β	toxicity.	In	vivo	and	in	vitro	
models	have	shown	that	limiting	the	phosphorylation	of	Drp1	induced	
by GSK3β is an effective way to protect the nervous system from A β 
damage.236 Axonal transport defects caused by A β result in impaired 
mitochondrial transport, leading to acute impairments in mitochondrial 
trafficking in A β- stimulated hippocampal neurons. Researchers have 
found that the activation of GSK3 β by A β is a significant contributor 
to mitochondrial transport dysfunction.237 Another study has revealed 
that GSK3β	can	co-	localize	with	and	regulate	HDAC6	phosphorylation	
in	hippocampal	neurons.	HDAC6	regulates	tubulin	acetylation	and	
affects the function of the motor protein-  1, playing a crucial role in 
the anterograde transport of mitochondria within axons. Serotonin, a 
neuromodulator, can enhance mitochondrial transport through AKT- 
mediated inhibition of GSK3 β, indicating that GSK3 β may interfere 
with	mitochondrial	transport	by	affecting	HDAC6	activity.238
3.6  |  Autophagy impairment
Autophagy is a cellular catabolic process responsible for breaking 
down damaged organelles and protein aggregates through the lys -
osomal	pathway.	It	helps	to	clear	out	Aβ and p-  tau.22	The	mTOR,	
which is regulated by GSK3, plays a crucial role in promoting au -
tophagy, thereby mitigating the pathological effects of A β and p- 
tau.239	In	the	previous	chapter,	the	relationship	between	the	low	
expression	of	DHCR24	and	the	pathogenesis	of	AD,	specifically	tau	
hyperphosphorylation	and	microglia	M1	polarization	was	presented.	
DHCR24	knockdown	resulted	in	overactivation	of	GSK3β, which is 
a	significant	molecular	mechanism.	Additionally,	DHCR24	knock-
down SH- SY5Y cells showed autophagy inhibition characterized by 
decreased	autophagosome.	Mechanistically,	the	activated	GSK3β 
phosphorylates	mTOR	at	Ser2448,	stimulating	it	to	act	as	an	au-
tophagy inhibitor. 240	PS1	KO	human	neural	stem	cells	also	displayed	
GSK3β related autophagy suppression. 241
4  | THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES FOR AD 
TARGETING GSK3
As	previously	stated,	the	excessive	activation	of	GSK3	in	AD	patients	
is closely related to tau phosphorylation, A β pathology, neuroinflam -
mation, oxidative stress damage, and other factors contributing to 
AD.	Therefore,	targeting	GSK3	has	been	a	major	focus	of	AD	treat-
ment	strategies.	In	this	section,	we	will	systematically	summarize	
preclinical experiments that have exhibited GSK3 inhibition and

method. 242,243 This article summarizes more than 10 new GSK3- 
targeting	compounds,	which	have	shown	certain	efficacy	 in	AD	
model animals. Their chemical structures and biological functions 
are summarized in Table  1. Compound 47 is an imidazo[1,2-  b]pyri-
dazine that exhibits remarkable GSK3β and p- tau inhibition activities, 
with	an	IC50	of	0.37 nM	and	58 nM	for	GSK3β and p-  tau inhibition, 
respectively. 245 As a designed GSK3 β inhibitor, compound 10a has 
shown	comprehensive	anti-	AD	effects	in	AlCl3 combined with D- 
galactose	induced	AD	mice,	including	improved	cognitive	ability,	
reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, and lowered hippocampal neu -
ronal damage, among others. 246	In	addition	to	the	aforementioned	
compound designs that target GSK3 β alone, many pharmaceutical 
chemists	have	shifted	their	focus	towards	the	design	of	AD	drugs	
targeting multiple targets, including GSK3 β. Compound 11c is a dual 
inhibitor designed based on GSK3 β and AchE, which has shown ob -
jective recovery of learning and memory ability in scopolamine-  or 
Aβ1- 42-	induced	AD	mice.	The	neuroprotective	effects	of	Compound	
11c include inhibiting brain tau phosphorylation and increasing ace-
tylcholine and serotonin levels in the brain. 247 Another GSK3β, AchE 
dual inhibitor Compound GT15 can reduce tau phosphorylation in -
duced	by	okadaic	acid	and	ROS	induced	by	LPS	in	vitro.	In	in	vivo	
experiments, GT15 can also enhance the learning and memory abil -
ity	of	AD	mice.250	Compound	LDC8	is	a	dual	inhibitor	of	GSK3β and 
CDK5,	which	can	alleviate	neuronal	inflammation	damage.	In	the	
zebrafish model induced by A β1- 42,	LDC8	therapy	increased	synaptic	
density by 67.6%.249 Compound 2 is a synthetic BACE1/GSK3 β dual 
inhibitor, which exhibits good inhibitory effects on A β formation, al -
leviating inflammation damage, and promoting neurogenesis. 251
Regrettably,	there	is	currently	limited	research	on	PROTAC	tar-
geting GSK3, as well as scarce reports on chemical drug designs 
focusing on GSKα.	PROTAC,	which	enables	targeted	compound	ubiq-
uitination degradation, represents a novel and promising strategy in 
drug design. And compounds targeting GSK α provide an alternative 
option	for	inhibiting	GSK3	in	the	treatment	of	AD.	Compound	PT-	65	
is	a	PROTAC,	which	has	strong	affinity	for	both	GSK3α and GSK3 β. 
By degradation of GSK3, PT-  65 can inhibit tau hyperphosphoryla -
tion and protect against cognitive impairments. 253 Compound 1 is 
a recently reported rare inhibitor specifically designed for GSK3 α. 
This compound and its derivatives designed based on it exhibit a se -
lectivity for GSK3 α that is significantly higher than that for GSK3 β, 
up	to	37	times	higher.	In	addition,	Compound	1	has	also	demon-
strated good activity in inhibiting tau phosphorylation both in vitro 
and in vivo.244
4.2  |  Natural products
Searching for drugs or lead compounds from natural products has 
always	been	an	important	 avenue	for	drug	development.	 Many	
researchers have also attempted to identify natural products with 
therapeutic	potential	for	AD	and	elucidate	their	mechanisms,	based	
on the long-  term experience of using traditional Chinese medicine 
or herbal remedies. The involvement of GSK3 in various pathological 
aspects	of	AD	is	evident.	It	is	apparent	that	these	natural	compounds	
exert their effects on GSK3, thereby protecting neurons, alleviating 
tau pathology, reducing neuroinflammation, and mitigating oxidative 
stress damage.
By	stimulating	PI3K/AKT,	selenomethionine	effectively	sup-
pressed GSK3 β and triggered Wnt signaling in the hippocampus. 
This resulted in a significant increase in the number of differentiated 
neurons from neural stem cells, coupled with an obvious decrease 
in astrocytes. 255	In	separate	studies,	20(S)-	protopanaxadiol	and	ole-
anolic acid improved the learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 
mice by inhibiting GSK3 β and activating Wnt/ β- catenin in the hip -
pocampus, ultimately enhancing neurogenesis. 256 Similarly, icarisid 
II	exerted	a	similar	molecular	mechanism	and	promoted	the	prolif-
eration of neural stem cells and neuronal differentiation, leading to 
considerable neurogenic benefits. 257,258
Morin	is	a	natural	flavonoid	that	impacts	tau	hyperphosphoryla-
tion by inhibiting GSK3 β, as suggested by both the crystal structure 
of	complex	(PDB:	1H8F)	and	surface	plasmon	resonance	result.259 
Moreover,	it	has	been	observed	that	morin	binds	to	the	ATP	bind-
ing pocket of GSK3 β	with	a	67 μM	dissociation	constant	value.260 
Ginsenoside Rg1 has shown significant efficacy in various ani -
mal	models	of	dementia,	such	as	OKA-	induced	AD	rats,	aluminum	
chloride-	induced	AD	mice	and	Squirrel	monkeys.261–263 Although 
the detailed mechanisms revealed in different reports are not 
completely the same, Ginsenoside Rg1 is believed to inhibit GSK3 
activity	in	all	cases.	For	instance,	in	the	AD	mouse	model,	the	inhi-
bition of GSK3 by Ginsenoside Rg1 is accompanied by a decrease 
in	the	level	of	PP2A.	In	the	Squirrel	monkey	model,	the	author	sug-
gests that the Wnt/GSK-  3β/β- catenin pathway is the main signal 
pathway under regulation, and that neurocyte apoptosis, oxidative 
stress damage and inflammatory reactions are all inhibited. 261–263 
Along similar molecular mechanism, ginsenoside Rd significantly 
attenuated tau pathology. 264 Lignans obtained from Schisandra 
chinensis Turcz. (Baill.) have a novel dibenzocyclooctadiene skele -
tal structure and considerable biological activities. 223 Among them, 
schisandrin B and schisantherin B exhibited substantial potential in 
alleviating tau pathology, and their roles in inhibiting GSK3 β were 
also identified. 265,266 Furthermore, several other natural products 
including paeoniflorin, 267 genistein, 231 berberine, 268 isobavachal -
cone,269 moscatilin, 270 xanthohumol, 271 resveratrol, 272 fisetin, 273 
C- glycosylflavones,274 geniposide, 275–277 ginkgolide A, 278 caffeic 
acid,279 asiatic acid, 280 ellagic acid, 281 etc., also played crucial roles 
in inhibiting GSK3 and mitigating tau hyperphosphorylation, and the 
specific molecular mechanisms were illustrated in Figure  3.
Certain natural compounds have demonstrated favorable anti-  
inflammatory and antioxidant activities in both in vivo and in vitro 
models	of	AD.	Oxyphylla	A	effectively	 suppressed	high	ROS	lev-
els in N2a/APP cells, enhanced the learning and memory abilities 
of	SAMP8	mice,	and	mitigated	oxidative	stress	damage.	Its	effect	
on the GSK3 β/Nrf2 pathway was identified as the key underlying 
molecular mechanism, whereby oxyphylla A triggered AKT phos -
phorylation, leading to the inactivation of GSK3 β and ultimately 
activating Nrf2. 282 Similarly, thymol and artemether, two other

natural products also activated Nrf2, albeit through different 
pathways. Thymol achieved GSK3 β/Nrf2 activation via AKT, while 
artemether	acted	via	AMPK.283,284  Eupatin is a natural substance 
that has the ability to bind with GSK3 β	and	hinder	its	activity.	In	
mouse microglia cells and macrophages that were treated with li -
popolysaccharides (LPS), eupatin was observed to diminish both 
the overall content as well as the level of p65 phosphorylation. 224 
Anthocyanins were also investigated for their effects on LPS-  
induced	neuroinflammation 	mice.	It	was	discovered	that,	besides	
regulating AKT, GSK3 β, and NF-  κB, anthocyanins were able to 
decrease	ROS	in	the	hippocampus	of	these	mice.285 Additionally, 
another study reported that in APP/PS1 mice, anthocyanins ex -
hibited antioxidant abilities through the GSK3 β/Nrf2 pathway. 286 
Neuroprotectin 	D1	is	a	pro-	resolving	mediator	produced	from	do-
cosahexaenoic	acid	in	neuronal	cells.	In	N2a/APPswe	cells,	neu-
roprotectin	D1	inhibited	GSK3β and led to enhanced autophagy 
with decreased expression of beclin 1. 287 Amentoflavone has been 
found to inhibit A β1- 42- induced neuronal apoptosis both in vitro 
and	in	vivo.	In	vivo	studies	have	shown	that	Amentoflavone	can	in-
crease	neuronal	activity	in	the	hippocampal	region	of	AD	rats	and	
alleviate	cognitive	impairment	at	an	epigenetic	level.	In	vitro	ex-
periments	using	SH-	SY5Y	cells	with	AMPKα knockdown demon -
strated	 the	importance	 of	AMPK	in	the	biological	 functions	 of	
Amentoflavone.	Mechanistically, 	amentoflavone	acting	via	the	
AMPK	pathway	inhibits	GSK3β and exerts anti-  apoptotic and an -
ti-	AD	effects.288	Meridianins	are	indole	alkaloids	isolated	from	
marine ascidians, which display remarkable cognitive improve-
ment in 5 ×FAD	mice	by	inhibiting	GSK3β and rescuing synaptic 
loss as well as suppressing neuroinflammation. 289
As mentioned in paragraph 4 of Section 3.3 , GSK3 β is also in -
volved in glucose metabolism, and AGEs are formed after chronic 
hyperglycemia. 7,290 AGEs increased GSK3 β activity and tau phos -
phorylation in female APP/PS1 mice. Treatment with trehalose 
mitigated the negative effect of AGEs through down-  regulation of 
GSK3β and triggered nuclear translocation of transcription factor 
EB (TFEB). 291 Similarly, Calycosin exhibits a neuroprotective effect 
against AGEs-  induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting GSK3 β.	In	a	rat	
model	of	diabetes	complicated	with	AD,	Calycosin	improves	learn-
ing	and	memory,	and	reduces	AD-	related	pathologies	such	as	neu-
rofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits, as well as mitochondrial 
dysfunction. 292
Finally, other natural products such as galangin, 293 naringenin, 294 
wogonin,295 curcumin, 296 and linarin 297 have exhibited certain 
GSK3 inhibitory activity and neuroprotective effects related to 
AD	in	vitro.	However,	these	effects	have	not	yet	been	validated	by	
in vivo experiments.
4.3  |  Marketed drugs
The secondary development of clinical drugs is an important as -
pect that cannot be ignored, with aspirin being the classic success 
story in this regard. Hence, many drugs already on the market have 
been	investigated	for	their	potential	to	relieve	AD	pathology	related	
to GSK3 β. The antidepressant fluoxetine inhibited GSK3 β activity 
through PP2A, thereby activating the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway. As a 
result, 3×Tg-	AD	mice	treated	with	fluoxetine	exhibited	reduced	neu-
ronal apoptosis, synaptic damage, and A β accumulation. 298 Sodium 
selenate also activated the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway via PP2A and 
GSK3β and effectively alleviated the symptoms of 3 ×Tg-	AD	mice.299 
Rapamycin	is	a	well-	known	mTOR	inhibitor	and	autophagy	inducer	
with proven efficacy in clearing toxic proteins such as A β and p- tau. 
Researchers have found that Rapamycin can increase Wnt3a expres -
sion, resulting in GSK3 β inhibition and increased β- catenin, thereby 
improving	AD	pathology.300
Lithium is a recognized inhibitor of GSK3 and is one of the most 
widely used mood stabilizers for the treatment of bipolar affective 
disorder.	It	has	also	been	attempted	to	treat	various	GSK3-	related	
diseases. 2,301 The relationship between lithium and GSK3, as well 
as	its	role	in	AD,	have	also	been	reported.	For	instance,	lithium	can	
dose- dependently reduce the mRNA levels of GSK3 in the cere -
bral cortex and hippocampal neurons of rats, and its inhibition of

GSK3β can promote AchE degradation by proteasomes and acti -
vate	cholineacetyltransferase.	 In	animal	models	of	AD,	Lithium	has	
also been demonstrated to alleviate scopolamine-  induced memory 
impairment. 302,303  LiCl also improved the level of Nrf2 in APP/PS1 
mice,	upregulated	the	levels	of	antioxidant	enzymes	such	as	SOD	
and GSH-  Px, downregulated the level of lipid peroxidation product 
MDA	in	both	brains	and	serum,	further	indicating	the	antioxidative	
effects of LiCl via the GSK3 β/Nrf2 pathway. 304 A retrospective co -
hort study identified a correlation between the usage of lithium and 
a reduced risk of developing dementia. This clinical evidence vali -
dates the role of lithium and further supports the potential of GSK3 
as	a	therapeutic	target	for	AD.305
Melatonin,	an	amine	hormone	produced	by	the	pineal	gland,	has	
gained recognition for its hypnotic effects, although it is currently 
only	approved	as	a	drug	in	some	countries.	Melatonin	can	inhibit	
GSK3β	through	the	PI3K/AKT	signaling	pathway	and	exert	a	series	
of	anti-	AD	effects	such	as	inhibiting	p-	tau.306 The GSK3 β inhibition 
effect	of	melatonin	can	also	lead	to	the	downregulation	of	ADAM10	
through the NF- κB signal and the upregulation of BACE1 and PS1.307 
In	N2a	cells	induced	by	okadaic	acid,	the	addition	of	melatonin	can	
decrease GSK3 β mRNA levels, increase nuclear localization of Nrf2, 
and reduce the expression of many anti-  inflammatory factors. 308 
Overall,	melatonin	may	play	a	significant	role	in	inhibiting	both	the	
expression and phosphorylation activation of GSK3 β.
Moreover,	certain	drugs	have	exhibited	promising	results	in	alle-
viating GSK3-  induced tau hyperphosphorylation. Figure  3 compiles 
these drugs, primarily medications for neurological disorders such 
as agomelatine, 309 risperidone, 310 escitalopram, 311,312 valproate, 313 
and cerebrolysin. 314	It	also	includes	other	classes	of	drugs	such	as	
dulaglutide, 315 lixisenatide, 316 atorvastatin, 317 sildenafil, 318 17beta-  
estradiol, 319 allantoin, 320 and sodium 4-  phenylbutyrate. 321
4.4  |  Other treatments
Mesenchymal	stem	cell	transplantation	is	a	clinically	objective	and	
low-	side-	effect	approach	for	treating	diseases.	In	attempts	to	treat	
AD	with	mesenchymal	stem	cell	transplantation,	researchers	have	
discovered numerous effects of the approach, including promot -
ing lysosomal-  autophagic clearance of A β and p-  tau aggregates, 
inducing	microglial	M2	polarization,	reducing	MDA	levels,	enhanc-
ing neuronal dendrite growth, and reducing synaptic losses, among 
others.	Mechanistically,	mesenchymal	stem	cells	regulate	miR-	134	
levels	by	activating	SIRT1,	thereby	inhibiting	GSK3β.322	In	clinical-	
grade	human	umbilical	cord	mesenchymal	stem	cells	(hUC-	MSCs),	
significant	restoration	of	cognitive	function	was	observed	in	SAMP8	
mice.	In	an	AD	cellular	model,	hUC-	MSCs	secreted	hepatocyte	
growth	factor	(HGF)	that	targeted	the	cMet-	AKT-	GSK3β signal -
ing pathway, downregulated hyperphosphorylated tau protein, re-
versed spine loss, and increased synaptic plasticity. 323	In	another	
study using human fetal neuroepithelial cells (hNSCs) obtained from 
the	endbrain	of	human	fetuses	aborted	at	13 weeks	and	implanted	
in	AD	mice,	TrkA/B	phosphorylation	in	AD	mice	was	significantly	
increased, which led to increased phosphorylation levels of AKT 
and GSK3β(Ser9). The inhibition of GSK3 β was accompanied by de -
creases in p-  tau, BACE1, A β, deactivation of microglia, and reduced 
inflammatory cytokine secretion. 324
Exogenous	administration	of	BDNF	or	neurotrophic	peptider-
gic	compounds	is	another	emerging	therapeutic	approach	for	AD.	
Injection	of	BDNF	into	the	hippocampus	can	enhance	learning	and	
memory	in	Okadaic	acid-	induced	AD	rats.	Mechanistically,	BDNF	is	
thought	to	act	on	the	PI3K/AKT	pathway,	inhibiting	GSK3β activity 
and down- regulating the phosphorylation of tau protein at multiple 
sites, including p-  tau (Thr231), and p-  tau (Ser396/404). 325 A neuro -
trophic peptidergic compound, known as P021, has been reported 
to	promote	BDNF	expression	and	exhibit	a	significant	inhibitory	ef-
fect on GSK3 β in 3 ×Tg-	AD	mice.	At	the	epigenetic	level,	P021	im-
proves cognitive impairment, reduces tau hyperphosphorylation and 
amyloid plaque deposition, and promotes neurogenesis and synap -
tic	plasticity	in	AD	mice.326	(D-	Ser2)Oxm	is	a	peptide	hormone	and	
growth	factor	similar	to	Oxyntomodulin	that	activates	glucagon-	like	
peptide	1	and	glucagon	receptors.	In	APP/PS1	mice,	the	administra-
tion	of	(D-	Ser2)Oxm	significantly	increased	p-	PI3K	and	p-	AKT	ex-
pression in the hippocampus while reducing p-  GSK3β- Y216 levels. 
Based	on	this	potential	mechanism,	(D-	Ser2)Oxm	not	only	alleviated	
working memory and long-  term spatial memory impairments, but 
also reduced the number of A β plaques in the hippocampus and re-
versed inhibition of LTP at the hippocampal synapses. 327
Electroacupuncture has a long history in traditional Chinese 
medicine and recent years have witnessed an increasing focus 
on its role in regulating nerve signal transduction and related dis -
eases.328	In	experiments	involving	APP/PS1	mice,	electroacupunc-
ture treatment at Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) acupoints has 
been shown to improve cognition while observably increasing p- 
AKTSer437, p-  GSK3βSer9, and p-  tau, emphasizing the importance of 
electroacupuncture on AKT/GSK3 β/tau signaling. 329 Additionally, 
high-	frequency	(50 Hz)	electroacupuncture	at	GV20	and	BL23	was	
found	significantly	enhancing	learning	and	memory	ability	in	AD	rats	
with A β1- 42 induction. This treatment also inhibited GSK3 β, leading 
to increased synaptic curvature, reduced synaptic cleft width, in -
creased postsynaptic density, and apparent neuroprotective effects 
against neuronal damage. 330	Moreover,	for	D- galactose- induced 
AD	rats,	preventive	electroacupuncture	 at	GV20-	BL23	acupoints	
resulted in GSK3 β	inhibition,	down-	regulation	of	p-	mTOR,	and	ul-
timately enhanced autophagy. 331 Regular physical exercise is bene -
ficial for human health, and running is considered an effective way 
to	combat	the	AD	process.	In	APP/PS1	mice,	treadmill	exercise	for	
5 months	has	been	shown	to	inhibit	GSK3	and	p-	tau	but	have	no	
effect	on	CDK5.332

GSK3 is a serine/threonine kinase that comprises two isoforms,

in many vital life processes owing to its ability to phosphorylate

numerous	substrate	proteins.	Clinical	evidence,	AD	animal	mod-
els,	and	some	AD	related	cell	models	all	demonstrate	varying	de-
grees	of	GSK3	abnormalities.	 On	one	hand,	the	expression	levels	
of	GSK3	in	the	brains	of	AD	patients	and	AD	model	animals	are	
significantly higher than those in normal individuals and animals. 
On	the	other	 hand,	 these	 highly	 expressed	 GSK3	also	exhibit	
relatively higher levels of activation, most notably reflected in 
the reduced proportion of inhibitory states (p-  GSK3αSer21 and 
p- GSK3βSer9).
The abundant expression of GSK3 and the reduced proportion 
of	its	inhibitory	states	play	various	significant	negative	roles	in	AD.	
Firstly, neuronal damage ( Figure 2) includes neuronal proliferation 
decrease, neuronal maturation retardation and loss of immature 
neurons, as well as abnormalities in synaptic, axonal, dendritic spine 
structures,	and	functions.	Importantly,	as	a	kinase,	GSK3	can	cata-
lyze phosphorylation at approximately 30 sites in tau. The relation -
ship between GSK3 and p-  tau is most widely reported, with various 
AD-	related	pathologies	such	as	Aβ or signaling pathways such as 
PI3K/AKT	signaling	and	AMPK	signaling	ultimately	leading	to	GSK3-	
mediated tau hyperphosphorylation ( Figure 3). Additionally, GSK3 
is involved in various processes of APP formation of A β (Figure 4), 
promoting the expression of the APP, inhibiting lysosomal degrada -
tion of APP, leading to an increased potential for the formation of A β 
precursor protein. Phosphorylation of APP, inhibition of α - secretase, 
activation of β - secretase and γ- secretase directly advance the pro-
cess from APP to A β. GSK3 is also involved in oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation	in	AD	mainly	through	Nrf2	signaling	and	NF-	κB 
signaling (Figure 5). GSK3 primarily increases the ubiquitination and 
degradation of Nrf2 through phosphorylation it, while its effects on 
NF- κB are reported to be indirect, such as through the impact of 
increased	ROS.	Other	AD-	related	pathological	processes	such	as	mi-
tochondrial dysfunction and autophagy impairment also involve the 
participation of GSK3.
There have been many studies on GSK3 inhibitors, but most of 
them are preclinical studies. Even the well-  known GSK3 inhibitor 
lithium lacks sufficient clinical evidence to prove its effectiveness in 
treating	AD.	Therefore,	many	synthetic	compounds	not	only	target	
GSK3 as a single target, such as GSK3 β/AchE inhibitors and BACE1/
GSK3β	inhibitors,	have	shown	certain	anti-	AD	effects	in	vivo	and	
in	vitro.	Many	natural	products	can	inhibit	GSK3	activity,	but	most	
lack sufficient experimental evidence to prove their direct inhibitory 
effects.	Morin	is	the	only	one	reported	to	bind	to	GSK3β and in -
hibit	its	activity,	thus	showing	anti-	AD	effects.	In	terms	of	marketed	
drugs, besides lithium, melatonin, escitalopram, and others have 
been	reported	to	have	some	impact	on	GSK3	activity	in	AD.	In	ad-
dition to drug treatments, alternative therapies such as electroacu -
puncture and emerging therapeutic approaches like mesenchymal 
stem	cell	transplantation	may	also	have	positive	effects	on	AD,	pos-
sibly related to GSK3.
Considering the lack of clinically proven effective GSK3-  targeted 
drugs	for	AD,	we	present	some	perspectives	and	recommendations	
herein with the hope of facilitating future research related to GSK3 
and	AD.
1.	 Differences	in	functionality	between	GSK3α and GSK3 β. The 
cellular localization and brain distribution of GSK3 α and GSK3 β 
differ,	hence	their	roles	in	AD	may	also	vary.	Drug	develop-
ment research has primarily concentrated on the functions and 
inhibition of GSK3 β, as the crystal structure of GSK3 α remains 
unclear. Nevertheless, recently designed compounds targeting 
GSK3α	have	shown	significant	therapeutic	effects	on	AD.	The	
aforementioned evidence suggests that researchers now need 
to give equal attention to GSK3 α as they do to GSK3 β.
2. The relationship between conformational changes in GSK3 and 
its substrate selectivity. The conformational transitions of GSK3 
play a decisive role in the execution of its functions. However, 
current research has only focused on the activation or inhibition 
of GSK3 activity. Clarifying the relationship between conforma -
tional changes in GSK3 and its substrate selectivity can aid in the 
more targeted design of therapeutic drugs targeting GSK3 and 
help avoid unnecessary side effects.
3. The role of GSK3 in the crosstalk among various pathologies in 
AD.	It	is	widely	acknowledged	that	complex	crosstalk	exists	be-
tween	different	pathologies	in	AD.	While	GSK3	has	been	shown	
to	exacerbate	multiple	AD	pathologies,	its	role	in	the	crosstalk	
among these pathologies remains partially understood. For in -
stance, while it is known that Aβ activates GSK3β indirectly by ac-
tivating α2AAR, the feedback regulatory effect of p-  tau on GSK3 
remains unclear. The role of GSK3 in the crosstalk between oxida-
tive damage and neuroinflammation has been partially elucidated 
(Figure 5). However, it is yet to be explored whether GSK3 has a 
direct activating effect on NF-  κB or if it exerts an indirect influ -
ence	solely	through	the	regulation	of	ROS.
4. The role of GSK3 in other neuronal cells apart from neurons. 
Existing research has found that GSK3 is overexpressed or hyper-
activated	in	the	entire	brain	region	of	AD	patients	or	animal	mod-
els. However, current studies primarily focus on GSK3 in neurons. 
As research progresses, increasing evidence suggests that other 
types of neural cells, such as microglia, astrocytes, and oligoden -
drocytes, also play a crucial role in the occurrence and develop -
ment	of	AD.	Therefore,	it	remains	to	be	explored	whether	there	
are significant changes in the expression levels or activity of GSK3 
in	these	neural	cells	during	AD,	as	well	as	the	impact	of	GSK3	on	
their respective unique functions.
5. Novel GSK3 inhibitors designed using updated methodologies. 
Present chemically synthesized GSK3 inhibitors mainly focus on 
inhibiting	target	proteins	by	combining	them.	PROTAC	technol-
ogy that prioritizes ubiquitination and degradation of target pro -
teins is becoming more widely used as drug chemistry advances. 
Currently, only one study has been reported on GSK3 β- treated 
AD	using	PROTACs.	However,	we	believe	this	is	an	excellent	at-
tempt, and we anticipate that novel structured GSK3 inhibitors 
will	exhibit	potential	in	anti-	AD	medication.
6. Combination therapy of GSK3 inhibitors with other drugs. 
Considering that existing GSK3 inhibitors are still in the preclinical 
stage, there may be limitations in developing therapeutic drugs 
solely targeting GSK3. Furthermore, certain compounds targeting

both	GSK3	and	other	proteins	such	as	AchE,	CDK5,	and	BACE1	
have	shown	potential	for	AD	treatment.	These	findings	provide	
some	insights	into	combination	therapy	for	AD,	exploring	whether	
the strategy of using GSK3 inhibitors in conjunction with existing 
AD	drugs	like	donepezil	and	lecanemab	can	better	control	the	
progression	of	AD.	This	represents	a	meaningful	endeavor.

 ","GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) serves as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. The article reviews various strategies to modulate GSK3 activity, including pharmacological interventions such as lithium, valproate, and phenylbutyrate; genetic approaches like overexpression of SIRT1; and non-pharmacological methods such as exercise and acupuncture. Studies show that these methods can reduce tau hyperphosphorylation, alleviate cognitive impairment, and improve synaptic function in Alzheimer's disease models. However, challenges remain in translating these findings into effective clinical treatments due to complex interactions within the brain's signaling pathways.","Glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK3), consisting of GSK3 α and GSK3 β subtypes, is a complex protein kinase that regulates numerous substrates. Research has observed increased GSK3 expression in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and models. AD is a neurodegenerative disorder with diverse pathogenesis and notable cognitive impairments, characterized by A β aggregation and excessive tau phosphorylation. This article provides an overview of GSK3's structure and regulation, extensively analyzing its relationship with AD factors. GSK3 overactivation disrupts neural growth, development, and function. It directly promotes tau phosphorylation, regulates amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, leading to A β formation, and directly or indirectly triggers neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. We also summarize preclinical research highlighting the inhibition of GSK3 activity as a primary therapeutic approach for AD. Finally, pending issues like the lack of highly specific and affinity-driven GSK3 inhibitors, are raised and expected to be addressed in future research. In conclusion, GSK3 represents a target in AD treatment, filled with hope, challenges, opportunities, and obstacles.","Glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK3) was first identified in the 1980s as a protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating and deactivating glycogen synthase in rabbit skeletal muscle. 1,2 Since then, GSK3 has been recognized as an evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase with a multitude of substrates. To date, over 100 substrates of GSK3 have been identified, with an additional 500 awaiting confirmation. 3,4 This extensive range of downstream regulated effects renders GSK3 one of the most functionally complex kinases involved in various cellular processes, including motility, metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. 3 The two isoforms of human GSK3, GSK3 α, and GSK3 β, consist of 483 amino acids (51 kDa) and 420 amino acids (47 kDa), respectively, as evidenced by research.5,6 These isoforms are derived from chromosome 19 and chromosome 3, respectively. 6,7 Both GSK3 α and GSK3 β have been detected in almost all species, with over 90% similarity across different species. 8 In Homo sapiens, the amino acid sequences of GSK3α and GSK3 β show 84%–85% similarity, while their kinase domains exhibit a high degree of homology, with 19 differential amino acids from the 285 amino acids that make up the kinase domains ( Figure 1A), according to sequence alignment. 6,7 Though hitherto no accurate structural information of GSK3α is obtained. Predicted result in UniProt (ht tps:// www. unipr ot. org/ unipr ot/ P49840# struc ture) suggests that the glycine- rich region distinguish between these two isoforms does not form a stable secondary structure. Hence, the secondary structures of GSK3 α and GSK3 β (Figure 1B) are also thought to be similar especially in kinase domains, which arrive at a conclusion that GSK3 α and GSK3β showed approximate biological activity. Nonetheless, research confirms that the glycine- rich region plays a role in localizing GSK3α inside the cell. 9 The wild- type GSK3 α is typically situated in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus, as stated in scholarly literature.7 Intriguingly, research indicates that truncated GSK3α lacking the N- terminal region congregates in the nucleus, with calcium stimulation further amplifying this effect. 10 In contrast, GSK3β displays greater nuclear mobility, particularly during the S- phase of the cell cycle and in the context of apoptosis, as reported in studies. 11,12 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that is typified by cognitive impairment and memory loss. It is the foremost cause of dementia, and while it remains a growing concern, the ever- increasing number of patients coupled with slow drug development has resulted in AD becoming a condition that is among the most destructive, expensive, and burdensome. 13,14 For instance, in the United States alone, it has been estimated that the cost of AD was approximately $305 billion in 2020, with around 5.8 million Americans affected. 15 In view of latest statistics, it can be anticipated that the figure of affected individuals is likely to rise to 13.8 million by 2050.15 While acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil and excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists such as memantine remain the preferred treatment options for AD, it is worth noting that they have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for multiple decades and offer only partial relief of symptoms. 16,17 Recently, another drug called Aduhelm (aducanumab), which is a monoclonal antibody that targets A β (amyloid beta), has received FDA approval for treating AD.18 However, there is still ongoing debate regarding its curative effectiveness. 19 Despite exhaustive research, there exists an incomplete understanding of the fundamental mechanisms at play in AD. Supported by characteristic pathological markers including the aggregation of A β and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), these factors are believed to be the primary contributors to AD.13 Furthermore, observations of inflammation, 20 mitochondrial malfunction, oxidative stress, 21 autophagy impairment, 22 gut microbiota deregulation 23 and occurrences of ferroptosis 24 have all been documented in relation to the onset and progression of AD. Above all, AD is a highly intricate neurodegenerative disorder that requires ongoing exploration of therapeutic targets and drug development efforts. 13,14 High expression of GSK3 in the brain stands out as a significant phenomenon compared to its expression in other tissues. 6 This finding was first noticed in animal models at both mRNA and protein levels and subsequently mirrored in the human brain. 25,26 Given its considerable expression levels, the role of GSK3 in normal brain physiology and neurological conditions such as bipolar disorder, AD, Parkinson's disease, and psychiatric disorders has become increasingly intriguing to researchers. 7 Taking into account the multifunctional nature of GSK3 and its relevance to several pathological features of AD, notably the formation of NFTs,27,28 significant attention has been devoted to GSK3 in the course of developing drugs for AD.29 The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively explicate the link between GSK3 signaling and AD, and to summarize the latest advances in drug development for AD that specifically target GSK3. Ultimately, the intention is to supply relevant guidance on basic research on GSK3 signaling and to chart potential directions for creating AD drugs that specifically target GSK3.","There is a wealth of evidence that supports a strong correlation between GSK3 and AD. Studies have shown that inhibiting the state of GSK3β, specifically p- GSK3βSer9, is beneficial for long- term memory formation.69 Through the identification of genes and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in hundreds of AD patients and healthy volunteers, it has been revealed that genetic variants of GSK3 β are closely associated with A β and p- tau.70 Moreover, high activity of GSK3β in the peripheral blood of AD patients has been found to be positively correlated with the severity of dementia. 71 Animal models have provided similar insights, as both the content and activity of GSK3β were observed to increase with age. 72–74 In a CamKIIα- tTA/GSK3β mouse model, where GSK3β was overexpressed starting at 6 months, neurodegeneration and other AD symptoms were observed at 12 months of age.75 Further mechanistic studies have revealed that the excessive activity of GSK3 influences the onset and progression of AD through various pathways. Impairment of the neuronal structure and function. Given the complex biological functions of GSK3 and its precise regulation, the dysregulation of GSK3, especially the excessive activation in AD patients or animal models, can have multiple negative effects on neurons ( Figure 2B). Researchers have activated GSK3 in model animals using different methods, and although the focus and specific indicators observed may vary, they have all discovered similar abnormalities in neuronal structural and functional processes. Abnormal neuronal proliferation and maturation processes, as well as resulting dendritic atrophy, have been found in CamKIIα- tTA/GSK3β mice. 76 Similarly, rats carrying the GSK3 β mutant with Ser9 mutated to Ala experience sustained activation of GSK3 β, leading to significant disruptions in neuronal oscillations in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal ventral side. 77 Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 β can promote neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice. 78 Specifically, GSK3 overexpression or excessive activation also damages substructures within neurons, such as synapses, dendrites, and axons. GSK3 β overexpression can inhibit synaptogenesis. 79 In rats with elevated GSK levels caused by exogenous or endogenous factors, the presynaptic active zone, postsynaptic density, and synaptic cleft are all negatively affected, accompanied by long- term potentiation (LTP) inhibition. 80 LTP inhibition and related synaptic damage are direct causes of memory impairment. 81–83 Excessive activation of GSK3 β in STZ- induced sporadic AD rats ultimately leads to decreased dendritic spine density and axonal thinning in the hippocampal CA1 region. 84 In AD mouse models exposed to Aβ oligomers, excessive GSK3 β activation is accompanied by dendritic spine loss.85 Axonal transport function is also severely impaired by GSK3 overactivation, leading to excessive accumulation of p- tau in the distal axon and impaired axonal transport of KIF1A (an essential protein for the delivery of neurotrophic factors), both contributing to the development of AD.86–89 In terms of mechanisms, based on the existing reports, the interaction between presenilin 1 (PS1) and GSK3 appears to be a crucial factor. PS1 serves as a significant biomarker of AD and has been demonstrated to be associated with the incidence of the disease, being utilized for establishing AD animal models through genetic mutations.90 Phosphorylation of PS1 by GSK3 β weakens its interaction with N- cadherin/β- catenin, resulting in the formation of trimeric complexes at synapses and a decrease in synaptic plasticity and neuronal vitality. 91 Mice with PS1 deficiency or mutations display increased GSK3 β activity, leading to notable axonal transport impairments. Mechanistically, GSK3β is involved in the augmented release of membrane- bound organelles driven by kinesin- I.92 Furthermore, excessive activation of GSK3 β increases the phosphorylation level of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), which hinders CRMP2 signal transduction and its regulation of axonogenesis and synaptic formation. 93,94 GSK3 is a critical participant in the β- catenin- dependent Wnt signaling pathway. 95 The pathway is known to have a significant impact on synaptic plasticity as well as memory. 96 The Wnt family is comprised of 19 lipid- modified glycoproteins and plays a crucial role in a range of cellular processes including cell metabolism, cell fate determination, polarity, and cytoskeleton alterations. The activation of the β- catenin- dependent Wnt signaling pathway involves the binding of Wnt to various cell surface receptors such as Frizzled (Fz), low- density lipoprotein receptor- related protein 5 (LRP5), and LRP6, ultimately triggering β - catenin to exert its biological effects. 95 GSK3 is a vital regulator of β - catenin degradation, and it forms a complex with casein kinase Iα (CKIα), Axin, and adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) to phosphorylate β - catenin. Subsequently, E3 polyubiquitin ligases recognize the phosphorylated β- catenin, and it is degraded by proteasome. Upon activation of Wnt signaling, the complex is eliminated, inhibition of GSK3 stabilized β - catenin, thus as a transcriptional coactivator that translocates to the nucleus to promote transcription of related genes. 95 Wnt- dependent protein degradation is a common occurrence in cells when GSK3 dysfunction manifests. GSK3's involvement in the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway aggravates AD- associated neuron damage.97 Following an evaluation of gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of both normal brains and AD patients, it was observed that the protein levels and activities of β- catenin and GSK3 β underwent a dynamic switch. These proteins are associated with Wnt signaling and suggest that such signaling is significantly impaired in AD patients.98 Further research has indicated that overexpression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf- 1 (Dkk- 1) in the hippocampus can lead to a reduction in learning and memory ability in mice. This effect was linked to synapse loss, LTP impairment, and long- term depression enhancement. However, the negative consequences were eliminated through associative inhibition of GSK3 and RhoA- Rock. Repression of Dkk- 1 expression displayed a similar effect.99 Overall, GSK3β plays a negative role in Wnt signaling- based neural functional recovery. Notably, activating muscarinic receptors inhibited GSK3 β and restarted the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway in A β1- 40- managed hippocampal neurons and glutamate- managed PC12 cells. This process helped protect neurons from serious damage. 100,101 Tau pathology. Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein that contains 85 phosphorylation sites, with over 50 of these sites having been identified as being phosphorylated. 102 The protein is predominantly expressed in neurons, where it exists in six primary isoforms. 103 The process of phosphorylation, a posttranslational modification, is essential for the biological function of tau, which tracks axonal microtubules and enhances their stability, thereby contributing to axonal growth and transportation. 104 However, hyperphosphorylated tau has been implicated in the formation of intracellular NFTs, a typical pathological characteristic of the brains of AD patients.105 Consequently, phosphorylated tau (p- tau) is recognized as a reliable biomarker for AD diagnosis and is also considered a promising target for AD treatment.106 GSK3 is a kinase of significant importance for p- tau, with approximately 30 serine or tyrosine residues from tau identified as potential phosphorylation sites for GSK3. 107 It has also been observed that GSK3's phosphorylation of tau is correlated with the formation of tangle- like filament morphology. 108 Importantly, recent studies illustrate that GSK3 β can directly acetylate the K15 site of tau protein, which has the negative consequence of inhibiting the ubiquitination degradation process and reducing its activity- inhibiting state (p- GSK3βser9), ultimately causing GSK3 β to become excessively activated.109 In essence, a detrimental cycle appears to have developed between tau pathology and GSK3 over- activation in the brains of AD patients. A meta- analysis conducted on studies related to AD involving the use of 3 ×Tg- AD mice found a positive correlation between Morris water maze (MWM) performance and p- tau levels. Additionally, p- GSK3βSer9 was identified as the primary contributor. 110 Further research involving GSK3 α deficiency mice suggested that GSK3 α also played a role in tau hyperphosphorylation. 111 AChE inhibitors, such as donepezil, remain the frontline treatment for AD, scientific investigators have discovered that in AD, AChE is colocalized with p- tau in neurofibrillary tangles. They have also found that GSK3 β- induced tau hyperphosphorylation suppressed the expression of AChE. Clinical studies involving the use of irreversible GSK3 β inhibitors have reported a 35 ± 16% increase in AChE activity among patients.112 Here we introduce the exacerbation of tau pathology by GSK3 signaling mediated by various biomacromolecules and micromolecules (Figure 3). PI3K/AKT- mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. The AKT enzyme is responsible for transferring the phosphate group to Ser21/9 of GSK3, thereby inhibiting excessive activation of GSK3 and maintaining the stability of p- tau. It has been established that AKT is initially phosphorylated and activated by phosphoinositide 3- kinase (PI3K).113 Therefore, it is widely believed that the PI3K/AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tau phosphorylation.6 Various upstream factors influencing PI3K or AKT may also partly affect tau phosphorylation through GSK3, which to some extent explains the interplay between neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and GSK3- mediated tau pathology. C- reactive protein, an immunomodulatory protein upregulated during inflammatory responses, induces tau phosphorylation in conjunction with alterations in AKT/GSK3 β.114 The excessive phosphorylation of tau induced by the inflammatory cytokine IL- 1β serves as a hallmark of the association between inflammation stimulation and tau pathology in AD. The phosphorylation capability of AKT on GSK3β is nullified by the sulfhydration of AKT at Cys77, which is contingent on elevated levels of intracellular hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) provoked by IL- 1β. This phenomenon leads to tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction. 115 Interestingly, a separate study demonstrated that exogenous administration of H 2S can directly sulfhydrate GSK3 β, resulting in decreased tau phosphorylation. 116 Thus, it is evident that high levels of H 2S have a dual impact on AKT/GSK3- mediated tau pathology. Therefore, in an inflammatory environment, whether AKT is cysteinylated or GSK3 is cysteinylated by H2S, which one takes precedence, is a thought- provoking question worthy of further exploration. The caspase family proteins, crucial proteases in cellular apoptosis, play essential roles in various biological processes in the nervous system. 117,118 Tau serves as a substrate for cysteine proteases, and caspase- cleaved tau has been detected in the AD brain but not in the normal brain. Importantly, caspase- cleaved tau exhibits higher fibrillogenicity compared to full- length tau. A combination of phosphorylation events and caspase activation contributes to the process of tau oligomerization in AD.119 GSK3β- mediated tau phosphorylation precedes caspase cleavage. Additionally, caspase- 3, a member of the caspase family, relieves the inhibition of GSK3 β by cleaving AKT, thereby increasing the occurrence of phosphorylation events. 119,120 Impairment of insulin signaling in the brain has been associated with AD. Overexpression of Regenerating islet- derived 1α (REG- 1α) in the brains of AD patients triggers tau phosphorylation through the AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway. 121 Mice with neuron- specific insulin receptor (NIR) KO exhibit activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway and significant tau pathology. 122 Overexpression of Phospholipid Transfer Protein (PLTP) in 3 ×Tg- AD mice alleviates various AD symptoms by limiting excessive activation of GSK3β and tau hyperphosphorylation through the PI3K/AKT pathway.123,124 Metabotropic Group I glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can influence PI3K/AKT, resulting in reduced GSK3β- mediated tau hyperphosphorylation. 125 The aforementioned proteins involve cellular signal transduction and intracellular and extracellular substance exchange. While a few studies have observed changes in their levels associated with alterations in the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway, this phenomenon is likely the result of multiple factors influencing it, such as insulin signaling, lipid transport, and metabolism. The underlying mechanisms by which these factors ultimately impact tau pathology through GSK3 β remain to be elucidated. A β- mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. The investigation of the correlation between A β and tau has been a consistent area of focus in research on AD.126 GSK3 serves as a crucial element in receiving stimulation from A β and promoting tau pathology.127 The research on the interaction between A β and tau, as well as the role of GSK3 within it, primarily revolves around the conformation of Aβ. Aβ1- 42 monomers, as opposed to oligomers, induce a PHF- like conformation of tau, resulting in multiple effects on tau, including phosphorylation, conformational changes, and degradation, while simultaneously elevating GSK3 levels. 128 It is worth noting that Aβ1- 42 oligomers can also promote GSK3- mediated tau pathology, with solubility being a crucial prerequisite. 129 A β1- 42 oligomers can bind with tau to form soluble stable complexes, enhancing the possibility of tau receiving phosphoryl groups from GSK3β.130 Additionally, A β1- 42 oligomers exhibit high affinity binding with GSK3 α, thereby promoting GSK3 α- catalyzed tau phosphorylation. 117 These findings confirm the interrelationship between A β, tau, and GSK3, although certain details still require further investigation. For instance, if A β can bind to both tau and GSK3 α, does that imply the formation of a complex involving all three proteins? Does the binding of Aβ to tau facilitate GSK3 β- mediated phosphorylation of tau, and does GSK3 β exhibit a similar strong interaction with A β as GSK3α does? In addition to directly binding to tau and promoting its phosphorylation by GSK3, the regulatory role of A β in GSK3 activity is equally significant. The indirect pathway of A β, mediated through norepinephrine α2A adrenergic receptor ( α2AAR) signaling, surpasses direct GSK3 β activation in terms of potency, 127 underscoring its crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. The cerebral neurons exhibit widespread distribution of α 2AAR, playing a pivotal role in transmitting norepinephrine signaling. 118 Aβ oligomers have the potential to bind to α 2AAR and induce conformational changes, redirecting norepinephrine signaling towards GSK3 β activation, thereby exacerbating tau hyperphosphorylation. 127 Moreover, Aβ also activates GSK3 and intensifies tau pathology through the promotion of adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) and double- stranded RNA- dependent protein kinase (PKR).131,132 Aβ also enhances the expression of E2F1 and c- Myb, which activate PAX6, a transcription factor linked to brain development and overexpressed in AD patients and animal models. PAX6 promotes GSK3β transcription and elevates the p- tau level at Ser356, Ser396, and Ser404. Besides, blocking PAX6 signaling partially mitigates Aβ- induced neuronal death. 133 Besides phosphorylation, A β also enhances tau accumulation via GSK3 β/SC35 signaling, which activates tau exon 10 splicing and increases intranuclear distribution. 134,135 The role of A β1- 42 in driving GSK3- mediated phosphorylation of p- tau has been extensively acknowledged. The non- amyloidogenic degradation pathway product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), known as sAPP α, exhibits a protective effect on AD pathophysiology by inhibiting GSK3 β and reducing tau phosphorylation, 136,137 suggesting that other intermediate products of APP processing merit further attention in relation to their association with GSK3. AMPK- mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. Recent studies have indicated that AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a crucial regulator of bioenergy metabolism and plays a significant role in AD.138 In various animal models of AD, low AMPK activity has been detected, while artificially increasing AMPK expression or activity has been found to ease tau hyperphosphorylation. Notably, GSK3 β agonists wortmannin have been found to limit the positive effects of AMPK on AD, emphasizing the pivotal role of GSK3β in AMPK- mediated suppression of p- tau.139 Moreover, research has revealed that memory impairment and tau hyperphosphorylation were observed in type- 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) KO mice with lower activity of AMPK alongside higher activity of GSK3β.139 In contrast, selective activation of CB2R was found to limit GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation; however, this protective effect was lost when AMPK was simultaneously inhibited.140 To summarize, the activation of AMPK inhibits GSK3β appears to be the primary mechanism by which CB2R mitigates tau pathology. Adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes, has been found to function as a euglycemic agent. 141 Long- term adiponectin deficiency has been associated with the induction of tau pathology and other AD pathologies.142 Mechanistically, adiponectin triggers AMPK phosphorylation, leading to the up- regulation of p- AKT and p- GSK3βSer9.142 Hence, adiponectin can effectively restrict tau hyperphosphorylation through the AMPK/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. However, it is noteworthy to mention that cerebral hypoglycemia has also been known to trigger tau pathology via the same signaling pathway, namely AMPK/AKT/GSK3β.143 GSK3 signaling mediated by other proteins in tau pathology. In addition to the above few signaling pathways or stimuli, there are numerous proteins that have been reported to directly or indirectly affect GSK3- mediated tau pathology. Firstly, there is a class of proteins that have been found to be abnormally expressed in AD patients or AD animal models, including Deficiency in G protein- coupled receptor- 5 (GRK5), Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), 3- β- Hydroxysteroid- Δ- 24- reductase (DHCR24), Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), Cystatin C, and beta- 2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs). Researchers have discovered the abnormality of GSK and p- tau during the investigation of their roles in AD. However, there is currently a lack of evidence to directly support their involvement through the modulation of GSK3 expression or activity. Therefore, further mechanistic research is still required as substantiating evidence. Deficiency in G protein- coupled receptor- 5 (GRK5) has been linked with mild cognitive impairment. 144 In GRK5 KO mice, overactivation of GSK3 β and tau hyperphosphorylation were observed, thus providing additional evidence of GRK5's inhibitory effect on GSK3β.145 Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) transgenic mice showed a striking pathological phosphorylation of tau, with upregulated p- GSK3βTyr216 and downregulated p- GSK3βSer9 indicating that GSK3 β was the immediate cause of p- tau.146 Increased expression of p44, a short isoform of p53, has been found to elevate the risk of tau pathology.147 Moreover, haploinsufficiency for p73, a member of the p53 family, has demonstrated a similar phenomenon. 148 Several kinases, among them GSK3 β, have been implicated in p44/p73- related tau pathology. 3- β- Hydroxysteroid- Δ- 24- reductase (DHCR24), an enzyme that converts desmosterol to cholesterol, has been found to be down- regulated in individuals with AD.149 Its levels are closely associated with caveolin- 1, an intrinsic membrane protein that is responsible for structuring caveolae leading to a key role in PP2A phosphorylation site localization. DHCR24 has been shown to promote the activity of PP2A, resulting in increased levels of p- GSK3βTyr216 and p- tau.150 Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a “longevity gene” that optimizes energy homeostasis, is underexpressed in aging- related diseases such as AD.151 SIRT6 KO mice have exhibited significant AD- like symptoms and tau hyperphosphorylation caused by GSK3 activation.152 In patients with AD, the continuous overexpression of the regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) has been observed to result in the downregulation of Calcineurin, an essential phosphatase that catalyzes tau dephosphorylation. Furthermore, RCAN1 has been found to induce GSK3 β- catalyzed tau hyperphosphorylation. 153 Cystatin C has also been observed to be upregulated in the brains of both AD patients and model animals, and its overexpression in neurons has been shown to accelerate tau phosphorylation by impeding the turnover of GSK3 β.154 A similar increase in beta- 2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) has also been observed, and their stimulation has been found to influence GSK3 β and Cyclin- dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in contributing to tau pathology. 155,156 Another major category of proteins, known as receptors, have the ability to perceive incoming signals and regulate cellular functions in response to signal stimulation. Several types of receptors have been reported, and their activation or inhibition ultimately influences GSK3- mediated tau hyperphosphorylation. The observation was made that the activation of M1 receptors in 3×Tg- AD mice led to a decrease in GSK3β activity and p- tau levels. It was also noted that administration of an M1 antagonist noticeably aggravated the pathologic phosphorylation of tau. 157 Based on these findings, M1 receptors were believed to play a critical role in the regulation of GSK3β and p- tau. Furthermore, the Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) was found to be involved in the regulation of calcium channels, which, when activated, could mitigate tau hyperphosphorylation via GSK3 β,158 while the inhibition of the histamine H3 receptor was shown to relieve GSK3 β- related pathologic phosphorylation of tau. 159 Complement C3 receptor has been reported to promote GSK3 β activity, while its inhibition has been proven to alleviate tau hyperphosphorylation catalyzed by GSK3 β.160 The nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) is recognized for its positive impact on synaptic plasticity and memory formation.161 Nonetheless, excessive expression of NR4A1 may activate GSK3β which can subsequently result in tau hyperphosphorylation.162 Chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) is a well- established inflammation marker that undergoes upregulation, and CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) is the receptor for CCL11 found in hippocampal neurons.163,164 CCR3/CCL11 has been associated with elevated p- tau levels, and GSK3 β plays a partial role in this mechanism. 164 Other proteins that influence GSK3- mediated tau pathology exert their effects through mechanisms that primarily involve direct binding to GSK3 or affecting the interaction between GSK3 and tau, as well as directly impacting the phosphorylation activation of GSK3, and so on. Studies have suggested that both GSK3 β and tau bind to the same region of PS1, thereby promoting the enzymatic effects of GSK3 β in phosphorylating its substrate, tau. 165 Furthermore, the key tau kinase, CDK5, is generally activated by the protein p35. However, the p35 calpain cleavage product, p25, has a higher preference for binding to and activating GSK3 β compared to CDK5, which leads to the phenomenon of p- tau enhancement. 156,166 Nedd8 ultimate buster 1 (NUB1) is a protein that is induced by interferon and is known to accelerate the clearance of proteins eliminated by the ubiquitin- proteasome system.167 Research indicates that NUB1 has multiple functions in regulating tau pathology, including the aggregation and phosphorylation of tau. Importantly, NUB1 promotes the degradation of GSK3 β and also impedes the interaction between GSK3β and tau. 168 Axin restricts the interaction between GSK3 β and tau, which prevents GSK3 β from pathologically phosphorylating tau.169 The programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) has established prominence in cancer therapy.170 Recent studies unearthed a PDL1- GSK3β immune complex within the brains of APP/PS1 and 5×FAD mice, an entity that heightens GSK3β activity and p- tau levels.171 The preceding paragraph has indicated the potential of ILK to augment the inhibitory effects on GSK3. 7 In N1E- 115 neuroblastoma cells, inactivation of ILK led to the loss of its inhibitory effect on GSK3β, which subsequently caused an elevation in p- tau levels. 172 The previous paragraph has also explained the role of GSK3 in the Wnt/β- catenin pathway. In aged rats, inhibited Wnt signaling by Dkk- 1 decreased PP2A activity and increased GSK3β activity, which resulted in excessive tau phosphorylation at multiple sites in the hippocampus. 173 Pin 1 is a promising target for cancer therapy. 174 However, the inhibition of Pin1 in AD amplifies GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation. 175 It has also been reported that GSK3β affects the proportions of different isoforms of tau mRNA through alternative splicing. Prion protein PrPC serves as an upstream regulator that inhibits GSK3 β activation. 176 Furthermore, interferon- gamma (IFN- γ) initiates cellular immunity and triggers tau hyperphosphorylation via GSK3β signaling. 177 MiRNA- mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. In brain tissues of AD patients, there is a reduced content of miR- 219- 5p, which has a negative correlation with both GSK3 β and tau- tubulin kinase 1 (TTBK1). 178 The 3 ′ untranslated region of GSK3 β mRNA and TTBK1 mRNA share a base sequence of 5′- GACAAUC- 3′, which can bind with miR- 219- 5p, thereby inhibiting the expressions of GSK3 β (instead of the phosphorylation of GSK3 β) and TTBK1, as well as the hyperphosphorylation of tau. 178 The most significant miRNA decrease observed in AD patients' neurons is miR- 132,179,180 whose down- regulation is closely linked to the pathological processes of AD, such as the formation of NFTs.181 Mechanistically, miR- 132 can regulate the expression and various post- translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, and limit the phosphorylation of tau through its negative role in both the transcription and translation of GSK3 β.179 The phenomenon of decreased miR- 23b- 3p has been observed in the plasma of AD patients, cortex of APP/PS1 mice, brain of SAMP8 mice, and SH- SY5Y/APPswe cells. Delivery of miR- 23b- 3p into the ventricles of APP/PS1 mouse brains can improve their cognitive deficits, alleviate AD pathology, and especially reduce tau phosphorylation at multiple sites. Mechanistic studies indicate that miR- 23b- 3p mainly exerts its effects by reducing the levels and activity of GSK3 β.182 Moreover, the LncRNA nuclear paraspeckles assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) facilitates the transcription of frizzled class receptor 3 (FCR3), thus limiting the phosphorylation of tau by GSK3 β.183 Micromolecules and other stimulus mediated GSK3 signaling in tau pathology. Inducers of disease models, environmental pollutants, and certain physical factors like noise pollution are all significant contributors to tau pathology that cannot be overlooked. The link between AD and diabetes is widely recognized, with GSK3 playing a crucial role. 7,184 Glucocorticoids, the key hormone responsible for raising blood glucose levels, have also been reported to activate GSK3 β, elevate p- tau levels, and impair memory in db/db mice. 185 As an inducer of sporadic AD models, STZ is frequently used in the modeling of both AD and diabetes mellitus.186 Experiments have shown that STZ can stimulate tau hyperphosphorylation through the PI3K/AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway. 186,187 Rotenone, a renowned compound extracted from Derris known for its ability to induce apoptosis, is also frequently employed in the establishment of PD models, has been demonstrated to elevate p- tau levels through the activation of GSK3β.188 Methamphetamine abuse often leads to dementia, and experimental evidence has shown that methamphetamine contributes to tau hyperphosphorylation through the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway.189 Cypermethrin, a pesticide, can up- regulate GSK3 β. Initially, cypermethrin blocks the heparin- binding epidermal growth factor (HB- EGF) signaling pathway, which results in neuroinflammation. The excessive generation of IL- 1 ultimately increases the levels of GSK3β and p- tau.190 Furthermore, 3- Nitropropionic acid triggers the mitochondrial origin of oxidative stress, while excessive activation of GSK3β and tau hyperphosphorylation were also observed in the hippocampus and cortex of mice exposed to 3- nitropropionic acid. 191 Prolonged exposure to arsenic can elevate GSK3 β activity and exacerbate tau hyperphosphorylation in SH- SY5Y cells, while multiple GSK3β inhibitors can alleviate the effects of arsenic. 192 Plumbum exposure can also lead to tau hyperphosphorylation, with the activation of GSK3 β and CDK5 being the declared pathogenesis.193 Furthermore, iron accumulation can increase the activities of GSK3 β and CDK5, thereby worsening tau pathology.194 Paricalcitol can alleviate iron accumulation by activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR), thus down- regulating p- GSK3βTyr216 and ultimately preventing hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser396 and Thr181 sites. 195 Intranasal administration of deferoxamine produces similar effects on GSK3 β and tau. 194 Chronic noise exposure has also been linked to tau pathology, with PP2A/GSK3 β being under- regulated.196 Interestingly, B- vitamin deficiency has been found to exhibit a similar function as noise.197 Moreover, stress responses such as electric shocks and ether anesthesia can exacerbate the pathologic phosphorylation of tau via GSK3β.198,199 These studies suggest the crucial significance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in preventing the occurrence and progression of AD symptoms. It is also advisable for AD patients to eliminate or minimize negative neurostimulants such as environmental pollutants and drugs while undergoing treatment. Nevertheless, further research is still required to substantiate the direct association between these stimulating factors and GSK3- mediated tau pathology. This is because, based on existing research, their impact on the nervous system is intricate and potentially irreversible, with GSK3- mediated tau pathology likely representing just one of the most overt pathological outcomes. Amyloid pathology. Just like GSK3 is associated with other typical pathological features, amyloid pathology is also known to be linked with it. This pathology occurs due to an accumulation of A β, which is cleaved from its precursor protein APP. APP is an integral membrane protein that is abundantly expressed in the synapses of neurons and plays vital roles in synapse formation and repair, anterograde neuronal transport, and iron export. 200 There are three isoforms of APP that mainly concentrate in different tissues or cells. These isoforms are named APP 695, APP751, and APP770, based on the number of amino acid residues. The shortest isoform, APP 695, lacks a Kunitz- type protease inhibitor sequence in the ectodomain and is the most abundant in brains and neurons. 200,201 However, APP 751 and APP770 are expressed more abundantly in platelets and peripheral cells. 200 It should be noted that not all cleavage processes of APP lead to the production of A β. Depending on whether or not Aβ is produced, cleavage processes can be classified into non- amyloidogenic pathways and amyloidogenic pathways. Figure 4 shows that in the non- amyloidogenic pathway, APP is firstly cleaved by α- secretase to form sAPPα and α- C terminal fragment (CTF α).200 Unlike Aβ, sAPPα plays crucial roles in neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity related learning and memory, 136 and it is produced more along with increased neuronal activity. 202 CTF α can be further cleaved to P3 and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), catalyzed by γ- secretase.200 The amyloidogenic pathway, on the other hand, involves β - secretase instead of α- secretase. In this pathway, APP is initially cleaved by α- secretase to form soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPP β) and β- C terminal fragment (CTF β). The γ - secretase also catalyzes CTF β cleavage, leading to the generation of AICD. However, under further processing by γ- secretase at multiple sites, 40 amino acid A β1- 40 and the 42 amino- acid A β1- 42 are ultimately generated. 200 These highly neurotoxic peptide fragments are the inducers of amyloid pathology. Therefore, it is significant to reduce A β generation by suppressing β- secretase and γ- secretase activities. Additionally, activating α - secretase could be helpful. GSK3β is involved in various stages of Aβ formation, both directly and indirectly. These stages include its impact on APP expression, phosphorylation, lysosomal degradation, as well as its influence on α- secretase, β- secretase, and γ- secretase (Figure 4). The association between GSK3 activation and A β pathology has been observed in numerous cellular or animal models. CDK5 knockdown in 3×Tg- AD mice executed at the age of 15 months, showed significant reduction in amyloid plaques. The activation of GSK3 β and PP2A was declared to be the primary reason. 203 The author of this report primarily focuses on the association between CDK5 and GSK3β. Unfortunately, the direct cause of GSK3 β activation leading to the formation of amyloid plaques in this one of the most classic AD animal models has not been thoroughly investigated. Nevertheless, GSK3 β siRNA was employed to knockdown GSK3 β in STZ- induced, in vitro and in vivo models of AD. The remarkable outcomes were overcome down- regulation of A β in cell models and mitigation of A β accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus of animal models. Inhibition of APP and β- secretase 1 (BACE1) by GSK3 β siRNA was found to be the crucial factor contributing to this phenomenon. 204 Conversely, inhibition of β- secretase was observed to stimulate GSK3 β and intensify tau hyperphosphorylation. 205 Senescence- accelerated prone mouse strain 8 (SAMP8) mouse model is a form of rapid aging animal models associated with cognitive impairment. In SAMP8 mice, the modification of the PI3K/AKT pathway gradually activated GSK3β with age. Ultimately, both β- secretase and γ- secretase were activated, leading to an increase in the levels of A β1- 40 and A β1- 42 in platelet and hippocampi. 206 Hence, the impact on β - secretase and γ- secretase appears to be crucial in linking GSK3 with A β pathology, and several literature reports provide strong evidence supporting this inference. As a kinase of glycogen synthase, the over- activation of GSK3 is one of the causes of glucose metabolism disorder leading to diabetes. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are toxic substances generated in the body after long- term hyperglycemia. 7 Receptor for AGEs (RAGE) had been established to contribute to amyloid pathology. GSK3β and p38 were identified as the connecting links between RAGE signal and A β. Gene silencing of RAGE curtailed GSK3 β and ameliorated A β accumulation, accompanied by attenuated activities of β- secretase and γ- secretase.207 Through the association of T- cell factor- 4 with the BACE1 promoter, the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway could impede BACE1 transcription. It must be noted that the GSK3 inhibitor propelled Wnt signaling and concurrently repressed BACE1 transcription. 208 The transcriptional expression, phosphorylation, and degradation processes of APP also exert an influence on the ultimate accumulation of A β, wherein GSK plays a significant role. When comparing gene expression between normal people, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and AD patients, GSK3β expression was positively linked to the expression of Amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 2, 209 a transcription activator of APP. 210 In an inflammatory milieu, astrocytes have the potential to transmit CK1 to neurons via extracellular vesicles, which finally exacerbates the formation of amyloid plaques, where GSK3 has a definitive function. More specifically, in response to the stimulation of IL- 1β, astrocytes secrete extracellular vesicles that envelop CK1. Then, after the transfer of CK1 to neurons, it engages in a complex with APC and GSK3, which obstructs the degradation of β - catenin. Consequently, this escalates the level of APP mRNA and in turn, intensifies the co- localization of BACE1 and APP. In essence, GSK3 is instrumental in regulating APP expression and amyloid processing through this pathway.211 Suppressing GSK3 β also diminished APP phosphorylation,212 which might change the APP cleavage process and stop Aβ production. 213 Besides, restraining GSK3 fostered the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor EB, thereby enhancing the number of lysosomes, which ultimately improved APP autophagic degradation, consequently curtailing A β level.214 Apart from curbing Aβ accumulation, GSK3 β also influenced the sensitivity of the hippocampus towards A β. It was found that the voluntary running of mice prevented their hippocampal network from disturbance caused by Aβ, and this defense was dependent on the inhibition of GSK3 β.215 Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Efforts have been made in recent decades to alleviate amyloid pathology and tau pathology in AD, but drug development progress has been slow.216 Therefore, researchers have also shown great interest in other pathogenesis, such as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in AD. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis are common phenomena observed in AD patients or animal models, thus characterizing oxidative stress. 21 Inflammation, as indicated by the high levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF- α, IL- 6, and others found in AD patients' serum and brain, has also been linked to AD. The alteration of immune cells, such as reactive astrocytes, T cells, and particularly activated microglia in the brain of AD patients, explains the occurrence of inflammation at the cellular level. The role of GSK3 in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation has been implicated in its known substrate nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor 2 (Nrf2), a significant transcription factor that responds to environmental stimuli, particularly elevated ROS.218 Nrf2 transfers from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to perform its biological functions. The dimerization of the transcriptional co- activator sMaf stabilizes Nrf2 in the nucleus, allowing it to interact with Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) to enhance transcription of various genes ( Figure 5), such as heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), etc.219 As a sophisticated regulator, the content of Nrf2, particularly the content in the nucleus, is tightly controlled by the ubiquitination system. Kelch- like ECH- associated protein 1 (Keap1) functions to concatenate Nrf2 and Cul3- Rbx1, a ubiquitin ligase complex, ultimately leading to ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2.220 However, Keap1 is not the only ubiquitination process involved in Nrf2 degradation. As shown in the Figure 5, another ubiquitin ligase complex, β- TrCP- Cul1, is also responsible for Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation. Crucially, when p- GSK3βY216 phosphorylates Nrf2, it greatly promotes the negative regulatory process of Nrf2. 218 Therefore, suppressing GSK3 β is considered a promising therapeutic strategy for AD due to its Nrf2 activation effect. For example, an antisense oligonucleotide of GSK3β that reduced the level of GSK3β in the cortex of SAMP8 mice also exhibited Nrf2 activation and improved learning and memory abilities.221 GSK3 has also been found to be involved in the muscarinic M1 receptor- induced Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus. Overexpression of the M1 receptor in PC12 cells enhanced the level of Nrf2, activated the antioxidant response element (ARE), and facilitated the transcription and translation of HO- 1. GSK3β(Δ9) nullified the Nrf2- regulated oxidation while GSK3β(Y216F) had little to no effect on it.222 The activity of Nrf2 is closely linked with inflammation, largely due to its crosstalk with NF- κB, a well- known regulator of inflammation.223 As shown in Figure 5, excessive production of ROS would facilitate multiple steps of NF- κB activation, which also relies on upstream regulatory factor IKKα ubiquitination and degradation. 223 Although there is currently no evidence of GSK3 involvement in IKKα ubiquitination, the collective suppression of GSK3 β and NF- κB has been observed in some cells and animal models. 224,225 For instance, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a promising target for inflammatory and AD treatment.226 Inhibiting sEH in Aβ1- 42 induced AD mice was found to stabilize epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, a series of compounds with anti- inflammatory properties. Interestingly, a high level of p- GSK3βSer9, accompanied by Nrf2 activation and NF- κB inhibition, was also observed. 227 From the perspective of signaling pathways, the Nrf2 and NF- κB signaling pathways are crucial for the neuroinflammation caused by excessive activation of GSK3. Meanwhile, from the perspective of neural cells, both microglia and astrocyte activation have been found to be associated with GSK3. Microglia, which are resident immune cells in the brain, release a large amount of inflammatory factors after M1 polarization in pathological conditions. Similarly, activated astrocytes can also release inflammatory factors and chemokines to attract microglia into the damaged area. A β1- 42 induces neuronal apoptosis and releases phosphatidylserine, thereby activating microglia and promoting neuroinflammation. The GSK3/Wnt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in this process, inhibiting PI3K/AKT to activate GSK3β and facilitate microglial activation. 228 A low level of DHCR24 was accompanied by GSK3β activation and hyperphosphorylation of tau.149,150 In addition to tau pathology, overexpression of DHCR24 in BV- 2 cells reversed the microglia polarization trend induced by A β25- 35. Increased levels of arginase- 1, IL- 4, and TGF- β, and decreased levels of iNOS, IL- 1β, and TNF- α reflected that DHCR24 promoted M2 polarization of microglia, playing an anti- inflammatory role. The key mechanism is the activation of AKT and thereby the inhibition of GSK3 β.229 GSK3β is also involved in microglial activation via phosphorylation of astrocyte CCAAT enhancer- binding protein delta (CEBPD), a well- known participant in inflammation- related diseases. 230 In astrocytes of AD patients, excessive activation of the calcium- activated potassium channel KCa3.1 was observed. In LPS- induced neuroinflammation mice, the KO of KCa3.1 protected neurons and alleviated cognitive impairment. KCa3.1 deficiency mice showed activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, suppression of GSK3 β, and inhibition of NF- κB signaling.231 Moreover, in vitro cultures of various glial cells extracted from rat cortex released various inflammatory factors including IL- 1β, TNF- α, and IL- 10, which were significantly decreased by different GSK3 inhibitors.232 Mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria serve as the primary sites for cellular energy metabolism. The brain, being the most metabolically active organ, relies on the abundant ATP produced through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In the brain of AD patients, noticeable alterations occur in both the structure and function of mitochondria, including changes in glucose and oxygen metabolism due to respiratory chain dysfunction, as well as accumulation of ROS and mutations in mitochondrial DNA.233 Under oxidative stress conditions, GSK3β translocates from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria in a kinase activity and voltage- dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2)- dependent manner. This process is associated with increased cell death and can be blocked by GSK3 β inhibitors.234 Studies have demonstrated that GSK3 β inhibition can enhance mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, while altering NAD(P)H metabolism. These metabolic effects are associated with the increased stability of PGC- 1α protein, enhanced nuclear localization, and increased co- transcriptional activation. This suggests that the GSK3β/PGC- 1α axis may play an important role in maintaining neuronal metabolic integrity.235 Dynamin- related protein 1 (Drp1) is a key protein involved in mitochondrial division and is highly expressed in neuronal cells. Research has shown that GSK3 β can induce the phosphorylation of Drp1, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation and increased neuronal sensitivity to A β toxicity. In vivo and in vitro models have shown that limiting the phosphorylation of Drp1 induced by GSK3β is an effective way to protect the nervous system from A β damage.236 Axonal transport defects caused by A β result in impaired mitochondrial transport, leading to acute impairments in mitochondrial trafficking in A β- stimulated hippocampal neurons. Researchers have found that the activation of GSK3 β by A β is a significant contributor to mitochondrial transport dysfunction.237 Another study has revealed that GSK3β can co- localize with and regulate HDAC6 phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons. HDAC6 regulates tubulin acetylation and affects the function of the motor protein- 1, playing a crucial role in the anterograde transport of mitochondria within axons. Serotonin, a neuromodulator, can enhance mitochondrial transport through AKT- mediated inhibition of GSK3 β, indicating that GSK3 β may interfere with mitochondrial transport by affecting HDAC6 activity.238 Autophagy impairment. Autophagy is a cellular catabolic process responsible for breaking down damaged organelles and protein aggregates through the lysosomal pathway. It helps to clear out Aβ and p- tau.22 The mTOR, which is regulated by GSK3, plays a crucial role in promoting autophagy, thereby mitigating the pathological effects of A β and p- tau.239 In the previous chapter, the relationship between the low expression of DHCR24 and the pathogenesis of AD, specifically tau hyperphosphorylation and microglia M1 polarization was presented. DHCR24 knockdown resulted in overactivation of GSK3β, which is a significant molecular mechanism. Additionally, DHCR24 knockdown SH- SY5Y cells showed autophagy inhibition characterized by decreased autophagosome. Mechanistically, the activated GSK3β phosphorylates mTOR at Ser2448, stimulating it to act as an autophagy inhibitor. 240 PS1 KO human neural stem cells also displayed GSK3β related autophagy suppression. 241 Therapeutic strategies for AD targeting GSK3. As previously stated, the excessive activation of GSK3 in AD patients is closely related to tau phosphorylation, A β pathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress damage, and other factors contributing to AD. Therefore, targeting GSK3 has been a major focus of AD treatment strategies. In this section, we will systematically summarize preclinical experiments that have exhibited GSK3 inhibition and AD therapeutic effects, including newly developed GSK3- targeting compounds, natural products discovered from traditional herbal medicine, and clinically approved drugs ( Figure 6). Meanwhile, we also present an overview of other therapeutic approaches that can impinge upon the activity of GSK3 ( Figure 6). Chemically synthesized targeted therapeutics. Using chemical synthesis to obtain compounds targeting the desired protein such as GSK3 has always been a direct and effective method. 242,243 This article summarizes more than 10 new GSK3- targeting compounds, which have shown certain efficacy in AD model animals. Their chemical structures and biological functions are summarized in Table 1. Compound 47 is an imidazo[1,2- b]pyridazine that exhibits remarkable GSK3β and p- tau inhibition activities, with an IC50 of 0.37 nM and 58 nM for GSK3β and p- tau inhibition, respectively. 245 As a designed GSK3 β inhibitor, compound 10a has shown comprehensive anti- AD effects in AlCl3 combined with D- galactose induced AD mice, including improved cognitive ability, reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, and lowered hippocampal neuronal damage, among others. 246 In addition to the aforementioned compound designs that target GSK3 β alone, many pharmaceutical chemists have shifted their focus towards the design of AD drugs targeting multiple targets, including GSK3 β. Compound 11c is a dual inhibitor designed based on GSK3 β and AchE, which has shown objective recovery of learning and memory ability in scopolamine- or Aβ1- 42- induced AD mice. The neuroprotective effects of Compound 11c include inhibiting brain tau phosphorylation and increasing acetylcholine and serotonin levels in the brain. 247 Another GSK3β, AchE dual inhibitor Compound GT15 can reduce tau phosphorylation induced by okadaic acid and ROS induced by LPS in vitro. In in vivo experiments, GT15 can also enhance the learning and memory ability of AD mice.250 Compound LDC8 is a dual inhibitor of GSK3β and CDK5, which can alleviate neuronal inflammation damage. In the zebrafish model induced by A β1- 42, LDC8 therapy increased synaptic density by 67.6%.249 Compound 2 is a synthetic BACE1/GSK3 β dual inhibitor, which exhibits good inhibitory effects on A β formation, alleviating inflammation damage, and promoting neurogenesis. 251 Regrettably, there is currently limited research on PROTAC targeting GSK3, as well as scarce reports on chemical drug designs focusing on GSKα. PROTAC, which enables targeted compound ubiquitination degradation, represents a novel and promising strategy in drug design. And compounds targeting GSK α provide an alternative option for inhibiting GSK3 in the treatment of AD. Compound PT- 65 is a PROTAC, which has strong affinity for both GSK3α and GSK3 β. By degradation of GSK3, PT- 65 can inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation and protect against cognitive impairments. 253 Compound 1 is a recently reported rare inhibitor specifically designed for GSK3 α. This compound and its derivatives designed based on it exhibit a selectivity for GSK3 α that is significantly higher than that for GSK3 β, up to 37 times higher. In addition, Compound 1 has also demonstrated good activity in inhibiting tau phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo.244 Natural products. Searching for drugs or lead compounds from natural products has always been an important avenue for drug development. Many researchers have also attempted to identify natural products with therapeutic potential for AD and elucidate their mechanisms, based on the long- term experience of using traditional Chinese medicine or herbal remedies. The involvement of GSK3 in various pathological aspects of AD is evident. It is apparent that these natural compounds exert their effects on GSK3, thereby protecting neurons, alleviating tau pathology, reducing neuroinflammation, and mitigating oxidative stress damage. By stimulating PI3K/AKT, selenomethionine effectively suppressed GSK3 β and triggered Wnt signaling in the hippocampus. This resulted in a significant increase in the number of differentiated neurons from neural stem cells, coupled with an obvious decrease in astrocytes. 255 In separate studies, 20(S)- protopanaxadiol and oleanolic acid improved the learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice by inhibiting GSK3 β and activating Wnt/ β- catenin in the hippocampus, ultimately enhancing neurogenesis. 256 Similarly, icarisid II exerted a similar molecular mechanism and promoted the proliferation of neural stem cells and neuronal differentiation, leading to considerable neurogenic benefits. 257,258 Morin is a natural flavonoid that impacts tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting GSK3 β, as suggested by both the crystal structure of complex (PDB: 1H8F) and surface plasmon resonance result.259 Moreover, it has been observed that morin binds to the ATP binding pocket of GSK3 β with a 67 μM dissociation constant value.260 Ginsenoside Rg1 has shown significant efficacy in various animal models of dementia, such as OKA- induced AD rats, aluminum chloride- induced AD mice and Squirrel monkeys.261–263 Although the detailed mechanisms revealed in different reports are not completely the same, Ginsenoside Rg1 is believed to inhibit GSK3 activity in all cases. For instance, in the AD mouse model, the inhibition of GSK3 by Ginsenoside Rg1 is accompanied by a decrease in the level of PP2A. In the Squirrel monkey model, the author suggests that the Wnt/GSK- 3β/β- catenin pathway is the main signal pathway under regulation, and that neurocyte apoptosis, oxidative stress damage and inflammatory reactions are all inhibited. 261–263 Along similar molecular mechanism, ginsenoside Rd significantly attenuated tau pathology. 264 Lignans obtained from Schisandra chinensis Turcz. (Baill.) have a novel dibenzocyclooctadiene skeletal structure and considerable biological activities. 223 Among them, schisandrin B and schisantherin B exhibited substantial potential in alleviating tau pathology, and their roles in inhibiting GSK3 β were also identified. 265,266 Furthermore, several other natural products including paeoniflorin, 267 genistein, 231 berberine, 268 isobavachalcone,269 moscatilin, 270 xanthohumol, 271 resveratrol, 272 fisetin, 273 C- glycosylflavones,274 geniposide, 275–277 ginkgolide A, 278 caffeic acid,279 asiatic acid, 280 ellagic acid, 281 etc., also played crucial roles in inhibiting GSK3 and mitigating tau hyperphosphorylation, and the specific molecular mechanisms were illustrated in Figure 3. Certain natural compounds have demonstrated favorable anti- inflammatory and antioxidant activities in both in vivo and in vitro models of AD. Oxyphylla A effectively suppressed high ROS levels in N2a/APP cells, enhanced the learning and memory abilities of SAMP8 mice, and mitigated oxidative stress damage. Its effect on the GSK3 β/Nrf2 pathway was identified as the key underlying molecular mechanism, whereby oxyphylla A triggered AKT phosphorylation, leading to the inactivation of GSK3 β and ultimately activating Nrf2. 282 Similarly, thymol and artemether, two other natural products also activated Nrf2, albeit through different pathways. Thymol achieved GSK3 β/Nrf2 activation via AKT, while artemether acted via AMPK.283,284 Eupatin is a natural substance that has the ability to bind with GSK3 β and hinder its activity. In mouse microglia cells and macrophages that were treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), eupatin was observed to diminish both the overall content as well as the level of p65 phosphorylation. 224 Anthocyanins were also investigated for their effects on LPS- induced neuroinflammation mice. It was discovered that, besides regulating AKT, GSK3 β, and NF- κB, anthocyanins were able to decrease ROS in the hippocampus of these mice.285 Additionally, another study reported that in APP/PS1 mice, anthocyanins exhibited antioxidant abilities through the GSK3 β/Nrf2 pathway. 286 Neuroprotectin D1 is a pro- resolving mediator produced from docosahexaenoic acid in neuronal cells. In N2a/APPswe cells, neuroprotectin D1 inhibited GSK3β and led to enhanced autophagy with decreased expression of beclin 1. 287 Amentoflavone has been found to inhibit A β1- 42- induced neuronal apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo studies have shown that Amentoflavone can increase neuronal activity in the hippocampal region of AD rats and alleviate cognitive impairment at an epigenetic level. In vitro experiments using SH- SY5Y cells with AMPKα knockdown demonstrated the importance of AMPK in the biological functions of Amentoflavone. Mechanistically, amentoflavone acting via the AMPK pathway inhibits GSK3β and exerts anti- apoptotic and anti- AD effects.288 Meridianins are indole alkaloids isolated from marine ascidians, which display remarkable cognitive improvement in 5 ×FAD mice by inhibiting GSK3β and rescuing synaptic loss as well as suppressing neuroinflammation. 289 As mentioned in paragraph 4 of Section 3.3 , GSK3 β is also involved in glucose metabolism, and AGEs are formed after chronic hyperglycemia. 7,290 AGEs increased GSK3 β activity and tau phosphorylation in female APP/PS1 mice. Treatment with trehalose mitigated the negative effect of AGEs through down- regulation of GSK3β and triggered nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). 291 Similarly, Calycosin exhibits a neuroprotective effect against AGEs- induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting GSK3 β. In a rat model of diabetes complicated with AD, Calycosin improves learning and memory, and reduces AD- related pathologies such as neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposits, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. 292 Finally, other natural products such as galangin, 293 naringenin, 294 wogonin,295 curcumin, 296 and linarin 297 have exhibited certain GSK3 inhibitory activity and neuroprotective effects related to AD in vitro. However, these effects have not yet been validated by in vivo experiments. Marketed drugs. The secondary development of clinical drugs is an important aspect that cannot be ignored, with aspirin being the classic success story in this regard. Hence, many drugs already on the market have been investigated for their potential to relieve AD pathology related to GSK3 β. The antidepressant fluoxetine inhibited GSK3 β activity through PP2A, thereby activating the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway. As a result, 3×Tg- AD mice treated with fluoxetine exhibited reduced neuronal apoptosis, synaptic damage, and A β accumulation. 298 Sodium selenate also activated the Wnt/ β- catenin pathway via PP2A and GSK3β and effectively alleviated the symptoms of 3 ×Tg- AD mice.299 Rapamycin is a well- known mTOR inhibitor and autophagy inducer with proven efficacy in clearing toxic proteins such as A β and p- tau. Researchers have found that Rapamycin can increase Wnt3a expression, resulting in GSK3 β inhibition and increased β- catenin, thereby improving AD pathology.300 Lithium is a recognized inhibitor of GSK3 and is one of the most widely used mood stabilizers for the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. It has also been attempted to treat various GSK3- related diseases. 2,301 The relationship between lithium and GSK3, as well as its role in AD, have also been reported. For instance, lithium can dose- dependently reduce the mRNA levels of GSK3 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal neurons of rats, and its inhibition of GSK3β can promote AchE degradation by proteasomes and activate cholineacetyltransferase. In animal models of AD, Lithium has also been demonstrated to alleviate scopolamine- induced memory impairment. 302,303 LiCl also improved the level of Nrf2 in APP/PS1 mice, upregulated the levels of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and GSH- Px, downregulated the level of lipid peroxidation product MDA in both brains and serum, further indicating the antioxidative effects of LiCl via the GSK3 β/Nrf2 pathway. 304 A retrospective cohort study identified a correlation between the usage of lithium and a reduced risk of developing dementia. This clinical evidence validates the role of lithium and further supports the potential of GSK3 as a therapeutic target for AD.305 Melatonin, an amine hormone produced by the pineal gland, has gained recognition for its hypnotic effects, although it is currently only approved as a drug in some countries. Melatonin can inhibit GSK3β through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and exert a series of anti- AD effects such as inhibiting p- tau.306 The GSK3 β inhibition effect of melatonin can also lead to the downregulation of ADAM10 through the NF- κB signal and the upregulation of BACE1 and PS1.307 In N2a cells induced by okadaic acid, the addition of melatonin can decrease GSK3 β mRNA levels, increase nuclear localization of Nrf2, and reduce the expression of many anti- inflammatory factors. 308 Overall, melatonin may play a significant role in inhibiting both the expression and phosphorylation activation of GSK3 β. Moreover, certain drugs have exhibited promising results in alleviating GSK3- induced tau hyperphosphorylation. Figure 3 compiles these drugs, primarily medications for neurological disorders such as agomelatine, 309 risperidone, 310 escitalopram, 311,312 valproate, 313 and cerebrolysin. 314 It also includes other classes of drugs such as dulaglutide, 315 lixisenatide, 316 atorvastatin, 317 sildenafil, 318 17beta- estradiol, 319 allantoin, 320 and sodium 4- phenylbutyrate. 321 Other treatments. Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a clinically objective and low- side- effect approach for treating diseases. In attempts to treat AD with mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, researchers have discovered numerous effects of the approach, including promoting lysosomal- autophagic clearance of A β and p- tau aggregates, inducing microglial M2 polarization, reducing MDA levels, enhancing neuronal dendrite growth, and reducing synaptic losses, among others. Mechanistically, mesenchymal stem cells regulate miR- 134 levels by activating SIRT1, thereby inhibiting GSK3β.322 In clinical- grade human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC- MSCs), significant restoration of cognitive function was observed in SAMP8 mice. In an AD cellular model, hUC- MSCs secreted hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) that targeted the cMet- AKT- GSK3β signaling pathway, downregulated hyperphosphorylated tau protein, reversed spine loss, and increased synaptic plasticity. 323 In another study using human fetal neuroepithelial cells (hNSCs) obtained from the endbrain of human fetuses aborted at 13 weeks and implanted in AD mice, TrkA/B phosphorylation in AD mice was significantly increased, which led to increased phosphorylation levels of AKT and GSK3β(Ser9). The inhibition of GSK3 β was accompanied by decreases in p- tau, BACE1, A β, deactivation of microglia, and reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion. 324 Exogenous administration of BDNF or neurotrophic peptidergic compounds is another emerging therapeutic approach for AD. Injection of BDNF into the hippocampus can enhance learning and memory in Okadaic acid- induced AD rats. Mechanistically, BDNF is thought to act on the PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibiting GSK3β activity and down- regulating the phosphorylation of tau protein at multiple sites, including p- tau (Thr231), and p- tau (Ser396/404). 325 A neurotrophic peptidergic compound, known as P021, has been reported to promote BDNF expression and exhibit a significant inhibitory effect on GSK3 β in 3 ×Tg- AD mice. At the epigenetic level, P021 improves cognitive impairment, reduces tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid plaque deposition, and promotes neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in AD mice.326 (D- Ser2)Oxm is a peptide hormone and growth factor similar to Oxyntomodulin that activates glucagon- like peptide 1 and glucagon receptors. In APP/PS1 mice, the administration of (D- Ser2)Oxm significantly increased p- PI3K and p- AKT expression in the hippocampus while reducing p- GSK3β- Y216 levels. Based on this potential mechanism, (D- Ser2)Oxm not only alleviated working memory and long- term spatial memory impairments, but also reduced the number of A β plaques in the hippocampus and reversed inhibition of LTP at the hippocampal synapses. 327 Electroacupuncture has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine and recent years have witnessed an increasing focus on its role in regulating nerve signal transduction and related diseases.328 In experiments involving APP/PS1 mice, electroacupuncture treatment at Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) acupoints has been shown to improve cognition while observably increasing p- AKTSer437, p- GSK3βSer9, and p- tau, emphasizing the importance of electroacupuncture on AKT/GSK3 β/tau signaling. 329 Additionally, high- frequency (50 Hz) electroacupuncture at GV20 and BL23 was found significantly enhancing learning and memory ability in AD rats with A β1- 42 induction. This treatment also inhibited GSK3 β, leading to increased synaptic curvature, reduced synaptic cleft width, increased postsynaptic density, and apparent neuroprotective effects against neuronal damage. 330 Moreover, for D- galactose- induced AD rats, preventive electroacupuncture at GV20- BL23 acupoints resulted in GSK3 β inhibition, down- regulation of p- mTOR, and ultimately enhanced autophagy. 331 Regular physical exercise is beneficial for human health, and running is considered an effective way to combat the AD process. In APP/PS1 mice, treadmill exercise for 5 months has been shown to inhibit GSK3 and p- tau but have no effect on CDK5.332"

ABSTRACT  
Alzheimer ’ s and Parkinson ’ s diseases are two of the most frequent neurological diseases. The clinical features of 
AD are memory decline and cognitive dysfunction, while PD mainly manifests as motor dysfunction such as limb 
tremors, muscle rigidity abnormalities, and slow gait. Abnormalities in cholesterol, sphingolipid, and glycer -
ophospholipid metabolism have been demonstrated to directly exacerbate the progression of AD by stimulating 
A β deposition and tau protein tangles. Indirectly, abnormal lipids can increase the burden on brain vasculature, 
induce insulin resistance, and affect the structure of neuronal cell membranes. Abnormal lipid metabolism leads 
to PD through inducing accumulation of α -syn, dysfunction of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and 
ferroptosis. Great progress has been made in targeting lipid metabolism abnormalities for the treatment of AD 
and PD in recent years, like metformin, insulin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists, 
and monoclonal antibodies targeting apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This review comprehensively summarizes the 
involvement of dysregulated lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, the application of Lipid 
Monitoring, and emerging lipid regulatory drug targets. A better understanding of the lipidological bases of AD 
and PD may pave the way for developing effective prevention and treatment methods for neurodegenerative 
disorders.   
1. Introduction 
Alzheimer ’ s and Parkinson ’ s diseases are two of the most frequent 
neurological diseases ( Aarsland et al., 2011 ). AD accounts for approxi -
mately 60 – 70% of dementia cases worldwide, with an estimated 50 
million people currently living with the condition globally 
( Collaborators, 2019 ). The latest projections indicate worrisome trends 
regarding the growth of dementia cases worldwide. Data shows that by 
2050, the global prevalence of dementia is estimated to nearly double 
from current levels. However, if defined according to biological rather 
than solely clinical criteria for AD, the predicted rise in dementia cases 
may be even greater, potentially tripling in scale based on the available

data ( Nowell et al., 2023 ; Scheltens et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, PD has a 
significant influence on human health as the second most prevalent 
neurological illness after AD. In short, AD and PD are imposing 
increasingly weighty socioeconomic burdens. Accordingly, identifying 
efficacious therapeutic solutions takes on vital importance. 
Lipid homeostasis dysfunction may pose a risk for AD and PD 
( Sarchione et al., 2021 ). Lipid metabolism disorders involve the accu -
mulation of proteins caused by changes in lipid content and oxidative 
damage caused by lipid peroxidation, which are different from the 
metabolic behaviors of normal individuals. In the body fluid and brain 
tissue samples of AD and PD patients, we can detect differences in the 
levels of cholesterol, phospholipids, and other lipids between normal 
people and patients. The accumulation of abnormal tau protein and 
β -amyloid protein (A β ) is the central feature of AD. The build-up of lipids 
like cholesterol and sphingolipid is linked to the accumulation of A β and 
tau protein ( Flores-Leon and Outeiro, 2023 ; Hashemi et al., 2022 ). In 
addition, abnormal lipid metabolism may indirectly affect the onset of 
AD through secondary pathological mechanisms. α -synuclein ( α -syn) 
aggregation is the main feature of PD, and the accumulation of lipids 
such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cholesterol is involved 
in the misfolding and aggregation of α -syn ( Sarchione et al., 2021 ). 
Abnormal attachment of α -syn to oxidized lipid metabolites also causes 
damage to organelles such as mitochondria ( Ruip ´erez et al., 2010 ). 
Many studies have also found that lipid peroxidation is strongly asso -
ciated with ferroptosis, which causes neuronal death ( Pope and Dixon, 
2023 ). As was previously mentioned, research shows a role for disrup -
tion of lipid homeostasis in the etiology and development of neurode -
generative diseases such as AD and PD. 
By targeting specific aspects of lipid metabolism, it may be possible 
to develop novel therapeutics that help restore metabolic balance in the 
brain and slow cognitive and motor decline. Great progress has been 
made in targeting lipid metabolism abnormalities in order to cure PD 
and AD in recent years. Some common antidiabetic drugs like metformin 
( Li et al., 2012 ), insulin ( Kellar and Craft, 2020 ), glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) receptor agonists ( Lourenco et al., 2013 ), and dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 (DDP4) inhibitors ( Kosaraju et al., 2013 ) have shown po -
tential therapeutic effects on AD and PD through enhancing brain syn -
aptic plasticity and cognitive function. In addition, regulating key 
enzymes such as HMG-CoA reductase ( Bar-On et al., 2008 ) and stearoyl- 
CoA desaturase ( Vincent et al., 2018 ) can also affect cholesterol and 
fatty acid synthesis and metabolism. Moreover, peroxisome proliferator- 
activated receptors (PPARs) agonists ( Comerota et al., 2023 ; Sastre 
et al., 2003 ) can inhibit amyloidogenesis by improving insulin sensi -
tivity. Monoclonal antibodies targeting lipid metabolism-related pro -
teins like apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ( Wang et al., 2018 ) and triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) ( Zhao et al., 2022a ) have 
demonstrated good anti-amyloidogenic effects by optimizing lipid 
transport and microglial cell functions respectively. This review 
comprehensively summarizes the participation of lipid metabolism in 
the development of AD and PD, the application of Lipid Monitoring, and 
emerging lipid regulatory drug targets. Greater knowledge of the lip -
idological roots of both AD and PD may pave the way for developing 
effective prevention and treatment methods for neurodegenerative 
disorders. 
2. Dysregulated lipid metabolism leads to AD 
Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) is a prevalent form of neurodegeneration 
commonly affecting the elderly which can lead to the progressive 
degeneration and death of neurons, particularly within regions of the 
brain instrumental for memory and cognition. Despite the current study, 
the precise cause of Alzheimer ’ s disease is unknown. Plaques composed 
of aggregated A β ( Roca-Agujetas et al., 2021 ; Wu et al., 2022 ) and 
twisted threads of tangled tau protein ( Merrick et al., 1997 ) are hall -
marks of the disease pathology. According to current research, unusual 
lipid metabolism has been linked to A β deposition and tangled tau 
protein. Based on these two characteristics, we will discuss the con -
nections between lipid metabolism and AD (see Fig. 1 ). 
2.1. Abnormal lipid levels accelerate A β deposition 
2.1.1. Elevated cholesterol levels 
One of the most typical features of AD is A β accumulation. A β is 
generated through the successive hydrolysis of amyloid precursor pro -
tein (APP) by the enzymes β -secretase and γ -secretase ( Hur, 2022 ). A β 
formation is promoted by the up-regulation of lipids, particularly 
cholesterol in the brain, which increases the ability that APP to bind to 
β -secretase and γ -secretase ( Mett, 2021 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). Further -
more, cholesterol impacts the polymerization of APP and γ -secretase ’ s 
processing of APP, leading to the generation of A β with diverse levels of 
toxicity and aggravation of Alzheimer ’ s Disease ( Wu et al., 2022 ). High 
cholesterol levels in neurons encourage A β -induced oxidative stress in 
mitochondria and impede the fusion of the dysfunctional mitochondria 
with lysosomes ( de Dios et al., 2023 ; Howe et al., 2022 ), which increases 
the number of dysfunctional mitochondria and causes nerve cell death 
( Roca-Agujetas et al., 2021 ). 
2.1.2. Sphingolipid breakdown to ceramides 
Sphingolipids are a key component of lipid rafts and help regulate 
the production and accumulation of A β . Normal levels of sphingolipids 
inhibit the formation and buildup of A β peptides, thereby preventing 
Alzheimer ’ s disease progression. Research has found the increased 
breakdown of sphingomyelin, a type of sphingolipid, in the brains of AD 
patients. The enzyme sphingomyelinase catalyzes the breakdown of 
sphingomyelin to produce ceramides, which was shown to stabilize the 
accumulation of A β . Therefore, abnormal sphingomyelin breakdown in 
Alzheimer ’ s disease patients further exacerbates the accumulation of A β , 
leading to further worsening of AD, and the above process is also linked 
with sphingomyelinase activity ( Czubowicz et al., 2019 ; Xing et al., 
2023 ). 
2.1.3. Other lipids 
Research has found that 27-hydroxycholesterol, a lipid that can 
easily pass the blood-brain barrier, increases expression of the enzyme 
β -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which is 
known to play a significant part in A β production via causing the 
cleavage of APP. I κ B phosphorylation and degradation were triggered by 
27-OHC in SH-SY5Y cells at the molecular level, whose degradation 
product p65-p50 dimer was able to translocate to the BACE1 promoter 
region ’ s κ B site in the nucleus, thereby upregulating the synthesis of 
BACE1 ( Wu et al., 2022 ). Studies have shown omega-3 polyunsaturated 
fatty acids can inhibit the activity of β -secretase and γ -secretase and can 
also increase the activity of α -secretase, ( Chen et al., 2021 ), which may 
have the potential to reduce the formation and accumulation of toxic A β . 
Furthermore, it has been shown that certain ratios of phospholipid 
vesicle constituents contribute to the reduction of amyloid ( Chaparro 
Sosa et al., 2020 ). This finding also points to a relationship between 
phospholipids and A β formation. 
2.2. Abnormal lipid levels promote tangled tau protein 
In AD patients ’ brains, levels of the tau protein are elevated and 
abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau comprises a significant propor -
tion. Phosphorylated tau loses its normal function as supporting 
microtubule stability. This disrupts the cytoskeleton leading to defects in 
axonal transport and neural connectivity ( Merrick et al., 1997 ). Studies 
have now linked imbalances in lipid metabolism to excessive tau phos -
phorylation. Disturbances to lipid metabolism can trigger inflammatory 
responses within the brain which promotes the formation and activation 
of different kinases and phosphatases involved in phosphorylation 
signaling cascades. Through these inflammatory mechanisms, imbal -
ances in lipid processing may elevate tau phosphatase and kinase

activity, thereby enhancing aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation ( Chen 
and Yu, 2023 ; Ismail et al., 2020 ). Dysregulation of PI3K-Akt signaling, 
which can result from imbalances in phosphatidylinositol levels and 
structural integrity of lipid rafts, may therefore promote aberrant tau 
phospho-regulation at multiple nodes ( Yang et al., 2020 ). This is ach -
ieved by activating downstream GSK3 β and Cdk5, which function as tau 
phosphokinases ( Yang et al., 2020 ). 
Cholesterol metabolism has additionally been linked to the modu -
lation of tau phosphorylation levels. Research has shown depleting 
cholesterol levels within lipid rafts can activate the raft-dependent Ras/ 
MEK/ERK signaling cascade, leading to phosphorylation of tau protein 
at multiple sites ( Mai et al., 2022 ). This goes against what we previously 
concluded and therefore requires further investigation. 
2.3. Imbalances in lipid metabolism indirectly accelerate AD 
Research indicates elevated cholesterol and imbalanced lipid pro -
cessing increase the risk of atherosclerosis, whereby plaques accumulate 
within arteries. Over time, this atherogenic process can generate cere -
brovascular lesions that diminish blood flow to the brain, exacerbating 
the underlying pathologies of AD ( Cortes-Canteli and Iadecola, 2020 ).In 
addition, imbalanced lipid metabolism is linked to insulin resistance 
( Kerr et al., 2023 ), a driving factor behind impaired glucose metabolism. 
When energetic pathways are compromised by insulin insensitivity, 
neural excitability may become diminished. This could lead to dysre -
gulated neurotransmitter release and reuptake ( S ę dzikowska and Sza -
blewski, 2021 ). Over time, sustained excitatory/inhibitory imbalance 
poses injury risks to neurons. Triacylglycerols and very low-density li -
poproteins, as two markers of lipid metabolism, have been flagged as 
likely contributors to diminished insulin sensitivity based on their 
metabolic profiles ( Rhee et al., 2011 ). Recent evidence points out that 
cholesterol is essential for maintaining typical synaptic architecture 
given its physical contribution to membrane composition. When 
cholesterol levels stray outside an optimal range, this destabilizes syn -
aptic structures. Over time, such injuries to synaptic organization at the 
molecular level are likely to impair communication between neurons. If 
unaddressed, progressively deteriorating synapse structures and func -
tions may therefore exacerbate disease progression ( Li et al., 2022a ). 
3. Dysregulated lipid metabolism leads to PD 
Neuropathologically, a defining feature of Parkinson ’ s disease (PD) 
is the presence of proteinaceous inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LB), 
comprised primarily of aggregates of the protein α -syn ( Spillantini et al., 
1997 ). Multiple biochemical processes are involved in PD, including 
mitochondrial or lysosomal malfunction and endoplasmic reticulum 
oxidative stress. In many recent studies, ferroptosis, a particular kind of 
lipid peroxidation-induced regulatory cell death, has also been gradu -
ally confirmed to be closely related to Parkinson ’ s disease ( Dixon et al., 
2012 ; Dong-Chen et al., 2023 ). Recently, researchers have observed 
changes in lipid metabolism in PD patients including sphingolipid 
metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis 
( Galper et al., 2022 ; Sinclair et al., 2021 ). Based on the above, we will 
discuss the connections between lipid metabolism and PD. 
3.1. Abnormal lipid levels accelerate the accumulation of α -syn 
Lipid accumulation observed in patients with PD is involved in α -syn 
aggregation (see Fig. 2 ). Mutations in the GBA1 gene represent a major 
genetic risk factor for PD. GBA1 mutant reduces the activity of the 
enzyme β -glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and leads to lysosomal dysfunc -
tion, therefore causing an abnormal build-up of cholesterol and poly -
unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) ( Flores-Leon and Outeiro, 2023 ). PUFAs 
accumulate within cells due to lysosomal dysfunction and other reasons. 
The elevation of PUFA levels may impact the functioning of dopami -
nergic neurons by upregulating the expression of the α -syn gene and 
promoting the oligomerization of α -syn and the formation of toxic 
oligomers, thereby increasing the risk of PD ( Assayag et al., 2007 ; 
Yakunin et al., 2012 ). At the same time, high levels of fatty acids can also 
cause α -syn aggregation, thus participating in the formation of LB 
( Erskine et al., 2021 ). The interaction between α -syn and cellular 
membranes may facilitate its transformation from benign, soluble forms 
to toxic, insoluble aggregates ( Marschallinger et al., 2020 ). Cholesterol- 
rich domains such as lipid rafts may be the focal points for α -syn ag -
gregation. Cholesterol is also thought to regulate the binding of α -syn to 
synaptic vesicle-like structures, potentially triggering their aggregation 
( Galvagnion, 2017 ; García-Sanz, 2021 ). Recent findings indicate levels 
of the lipid transport apolipoprotein (ApoE) are elevated in cerebro -
spinal fluid of early PD patients. As ApoE encodes a protein that medi -
ates lipid trafficking, this suggests α -syn may augment its spread 
between neurons by interacting with ApoE ( Paslawski et al., 2019 ). 
3.2. Abnormal lipid levels lead to dysfunction of mitochondria and 
endoplasmic reticulum 
Lipid metabolism disorders such as fatty acids and cardiolipin

B. Tong et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Neurobiology of Disease 196 (2024) 106505

participate in mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, 
which leads to dysfunction of neurons and plays an important role in the 
pathogenesis of PD. Excessive lipid accumulation can induce 
mitochondria-cytoplasmic stress response (MCSR), and the resulting 
ROS preferentially targets PUFAs, leading to the occurrence of PUFA 
peroxidation, thereby altering mitochondrial permeability and leading 
to mitochondrial dysfunction ( Kim et al., 2016 ). Research has estab -
lished that Elovl2 is a key endoplasmic reticulum-located very long- 
chain fatty acid elongase. Deficiency of Elovl2 may result in impaired 
fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of short-chain fatty acids within 
the endoplasmic reticulum. The build-up of free fatty acids in the 
endoplasmic reticulum damages its function, leading to increased 
unfolded or misfolded protein load, chronic endoplasmic reticulum 
stress, and elevated risk of mitochondrial dysfunction ( Li et al., 2022c ). 
There has been evidence of a decrease in SIRT6 activity in the brains of 
PD patients ( Stein et al., 2021 ). Research has shown that a deficiency of 
SIRT6 can lead to decreased mitochondrial gene expression, elevating 
the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial 
decay, thereby initiating mitochondrial dysfunction ( Smirnov et al., 
2023 ). In addition, disruption to mitochondrial lipid metabolism could 
further influence mitochondrial structure and function. Cardiolipin (CL) 
is a glycerophospholipid that is present in the mitochondrial membranes 
of eukaryotic cells ( van Meer et al., 2008 ). Misfolded α -syn interacting 
with cardiolipin has the potential to compromise the integrity of mito -
chondrial membranes and thereby impair mitochondrial function ( Ghio 
et al., 2016 ). Additionally, research has revealed that CL mediated the 
targeted autophagy of abnormal mitochondria, abnormal CL content 
could hinder mitochondrial autophagy, and abnormal mitochondrial 
aggregation could trigger inflammation through the NLRP3 inflamma -
some and/or cGAS-cgamp-STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway, further aggra -
vation of neuronal cell damage ( Chu et al., 2013 ; Doblado et al., 2021 ; 
Hsu and Shi, 2017 ; Tansey et al., 2022 ). Hence, it can be inferred that 
there is a delicate balance between cardiolipin (CL), mitochondria, and 
Parkinson ’ s disease. Abnormal CL metabolism can lead to Parkinson ’ s 
disease by affecting mitochondrial function or inhibiting abnormal 
mitochondrial autophagy. The disorder of lipid metabolic coupling be -
tween neurons and astrocytes is also closely related to PD ( Bantle et al., 
2020 ). Toxic fatty acids (FAs) generated in hyperactive neurons are 
transported to astrocyte lipid droplets via APOE-positive lipid particles 
and consumed through mitochondrial beta-oxidation for detoxification 
( Ioannou et al., 2019 ). Pathogenic α -syn is involved in astrocyte mito -
chondrial dysfunction ( Braidy et al., 2013 ). Mitochondrial dysfunction 
of astrocytes can reduce FA metabolism, make neurons poisoned by FA, 
and aggravate the PD process. 
3.3. Dysregulated lipid metabolism leads to ferroptosis 
Parkinson ’ s disease-related dopaminergic neuronal degeneration is 
linked to ferroptosis, which is primarily brought on by problems in lipid 
metabolism ( Dixon et al., 2012 ). Given the high lipid content in brain 
tissue, the central nervous system may be particularly vulnerable to 
oxidative damage caused by lipid peroxidation. Unrestricted lipid per -
oxidation is a hallmark of ferroptosis, and lipid peroxidation products 
play a key role in Parkinson ’ s disease ( Gaschler and Stockwell, 2017 ; 
Yang et al., 2016 ). PUFAs accumulated in PD patients are the main 
substrates for these peroxidation processes, and the elevated levels of 
peroxide substrates such as ceramide and lysophosphatidylcholine 
produced by peroxidation can lead to cellular oxidative damage, 
resulting in ferroptosis ( Yan et al., 2021 ; Yang et al., 2016 ). Lipid per -
oxidation produces lipid free radicals and lipid peroxyl free radicals, 
which react with PUFAs to produce lipid peroxides, which further 
aggravate the oxidation process of PUFAs and accelerate the occurrence 
of ferroptosis ( Stockwell et al., 2017 ). The oxidation of arachidonic acid 
(AA) and other polyunsaturated fatty acids in the phosphatidyletha -
nolamine (PE) of the cell membrane can damage the membrane and 
induce ferroptosis ( Astudillo et al., 2023 ). In the condition of lipid 
metabolism disorders, glutathione peroxidase 4(GPX4) plays a role in 
alleviating ferroptosis by converting lipid peroxides into lipid alcohols. 
GPX4 activity decreased, and the antioxidant capacity of cells decreased, 
making PUFAs more easily oxidized, indirectly aggravating the process 
of ferroptosis ( Costa et al., 2023 ). Therefore, PD may arise as a result of 
abnormalities in lipid metabolism by affecting the process of 
desferrioxia. 
Taken above, it is not difficult to see that lipid metabolism plays an 
important role in the accumulation of α -syn, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
and ferroptosis. However, these effects do not exist independently in the 
pathogenesis of PD. Ferroptosis can affect the metabolism of α -syn and 
lead to its accumulation ( Castellani et al., 2000 ). Accumulation of α -syn 
can also cause mitochondrial dysfunction ( Ordonez et al., 2018 ). This 
vicious cycle causes the degree of Parkinson ’ s disease to gradually 
worsen, demonstrating the important role of lipid metabolism in the 
pathogenic process of Parkinson ’ s disease.

4. Application of lipid monitoring in AD and PD 
Previously, we summarized the relationship between lipid meta -
bolism and AD and PD. A large number of studies have found that the 
levels of lipids and their metabolites in brain tissue and body fluids of AD 
and PD patients are different from those of healthy individuals or special 
patients with the disease (see Table 1 and Table 2 ). In AD patients, 
research has revealed that the degree of major membrane phospholipids 
in patients ‘brains is considerably less than what was observed in the 
control group, and the related metabolites are increased. Monitoring the 
degree of phospholipid degeneration of brain cell membranes is an 
important index to judge the development of AD ( Nitsch et al., 1992 ). At 
the same time, the detection results of lipid levels in AD patients are also 
different for different races. Ethnic background also has an impact on 
lipid levels in AD patients, and lipid monitoring also has racial signifi -
cance ( Khan et al., 2022 ). For patients with AD, obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) is the most prevalent type of sleep breathing disturbance. Plasma 
lipidomics is significantly different in these two types of patients (gen -
eral AD patients versus AD patients with OSA), so lipid monitoring can 
be used to diagnose AD and severe OSA patients, permitting personal -
ized management of these individuals ( Dakterzada et al., 2022 ). In the 
serum of PD patients, the proportion of most lipids is too high compared 
with the control group, and the difference in related metabolites can 
feedback the metabolic process in Parkinson ’ s disease. According to the 
monitored lipid changes, it can be inferred that 20 PD-related pathways 
such as carnitine shuttling, vitamin E metabolism, glycerol, sphingoli -
pid, fatty acids, and aminoacyl-trNA biosynthesis have significant 
changes ( Pereira et al., 2022 ). Additionally, lipid profiling can correlate 
specific lipid compositional features with the severity of PD. The Unified 
Parkinson ’ s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is used to assess symptom 
severity, with higher scores indicating more serious manifestations. 
Research shows that higher levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and 
dihydro globotriaosylceramide (dhGB3) correlate positively with 
increased UPDRS scores and more severe PD symptoms. Meanwhile, 
elevated dihydrosphingomyelin (dhSM) and plasmenylethanolamine 
(PEp) are associated with lower UPDRS scoring and comparatively 
milder presentations of the disease ( Avisar et al., 2021 ). 
From the standpoint of brain structure and function, brain imaging 
methods include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), positron emission to -
mography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), and 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can noninvasively iden -
tify changes in brain biomarkers ( Rathore et al., 2017 ).In recent years, 
brain imaging biomarker genomics and metabolomics have been 
extensively utilized in the diagnosis and assessment of disease staging of 
AD and PD ( Li et al., 2022b ). In addition, there is increasing evidence 
that the lipidomic markers are increasingly supporting the diagnosis, 
prognosis, and detection of therapeutic effects of AD and PD ( Chiurchiù 
et al., 2022 ). Therefore, we believe that brain imaging technology can be 
further used to monitor the lipid changes in the occurrence and treat -
ment response of AD and PD, providing a new direction for future 
clinical research.

5. Therapeutic approaches targeted lipid metabolism 
Taken above, it is becoming more widely acknowledged that lipid 
metabolic abnormalities are a major contributing factor in the etiology 
of AD and PD. Here we summarize the therapeutic approaches that have 
been explored so far to modulate lipid metabolic dysfunction in AD and 
PD. 
5.1. Dietary supplements and related enzymes 
To treat AD and PD, dietary supplements containing polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have shown therapeutic promise (Strike 
et al., 2016). PUFA supplementation improves hippocampus synaptic 
plasticity (Nagaraja et al., 2021) and ameliorates (Strike et al., 2016) 
cognitive deficits in AD animal models. Activation of retinoid X re -
ceptors (RXRs) by natural ligands, including 9-cis retinoic acid, and DHA 
plays a role in these positive effects (Casali et al., 2015; de Urquiza et al., 
2000). Epidemiologically, increased intake of ω -3 PUFAs, particularly 
DHA and EPA, is associated with a reduced risk of AD, while lower ω -3 
PUFA intake increases the risk (Zhang et al., 2016) In this case, some 
enzyme inhibitors play a therapeutic role by inhibiting the lipid meta -
bolism process of the enzyme (see Table 3). For example, the activity 
and expression of phospholipase A2 in AD are altered. Increased PLA2 
activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients is accompanied by an 
increase in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which is associated with 
increased inflammation(Fonteh et al., 2013). Different PLA2 subtypes 
have different effects on membrane remodeling and function (Chew

et al., 2020). Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in -
creases the severity of AD by oxidizing LDL and hydrolyzing it into two 
biologically active products, thereby promoting inflammation (Huang 
et al., 2020). The application of Lp-PLA2 inhibitors may play a good role 
in the treatment of AD (Acharya et al., 2013). The increase of cytosolic 
PLA2 (cPLA2) enzyme activity mainly releases arachidonic acid, thus 
promoting the progress of the AD pathway, while reducing the ability of 
microglia to phagocytose Aβ in AD brain, thus further promoting the 
pathogenesis of the disease (Khan and Ilies, 2023). Therefore, relevant 
inhibitors may play a role in reducing the course of AD by blocking these 
pathways(Schaeffer et al., 2011). 
5.2. Antidiabetic drugs 
Antidiabetic drugs have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control, 
as they are also able to regulate lipid metabolism. As diabetes shares 
certain pathophysiological similarities with neurodegenerative diseases 
like AD and PD, researchers have explored whether existing antidiabetic 
therapies may also benefit these conditions (see Table 4). Metformin is a 
first-line treatment for diabetes and it can penetrate the blood-brain 
barrier and build up to therapeutic amounts in the brain, according to 
studies. Metformin has gained interest for its potential neuroprotective 
effects in AD and PD through its ability to activate the AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) (Li et al., 2012; Mor et al., 2020). As a key 
metabolic hormone, insulin (Kellar and Craft, 2020; Novak et al., 2019) 
improves brain cognition and synaptic plasticity in AD and PD. Further, 
thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) improve insulin sensi -
tivity by stimulating PPARs (see Table 4). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP- 
1) (Lourenco et al., 2013; Yun et al., 2018) and gastric inhibitory 
polypeptide (GIP) (Cao et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2018) are secreted by 
enteroendocrine L cells in the intestine in response to nutrient ingestion 
and could promote the release of insulin. Inhibiting dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is an enzyme that can rapidly degrade GLP-1 within 
two minutes (Kosaraju et al., 2013; Nassar et al., 2015), thus preserving 
active levels of endogenous GLP-1. 
5.3. Targeting nuclear receptor superfamily 
The nuclear receptor superfamily controls the expression of target 
genes by binding to element-specific sequences located at gene promoter 
regions, regulating inflammation, energy balance, as well as lipid and 
glucose metabolism (Moutinho and Landreth, 2017). Due to their ability 
to lower toxic lipid products, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, and 
potential neuroprotective benefits, activating these receptors with spe -
cific agonists shows great promise for AD (Moutinho and Landreth, 
2017). The retinoid bexarotene synthetic agonist, which the FDA 
licensed for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is a potent 
agonist of the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and has been shown to alle -
viate cognitive impairments in AD (Cramer et al., 2012; Savage et al., 
2015). Among all the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors 
(PPARs), PPAR- α uniquely impacts excitatory cholinergic/dopaminergic 
signaling and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain. It also 
regulates mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and 
oxidative stress (Comerota et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2020). PPAR-γ is 
involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cell differentiation relating to 
neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory processes (Sastre et al., 
2003; Yamanaka et al., 2012). PPAR-β/δ presides over the processes of 
myelination, lipid metabolism, and cellular differentiation (Chamber -
lain et al., 2020). Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha 
(REV-ERB α ) is extensively involved in the regulation of the biological 
clock as well as the control of glucose metabolism and triglyceride levels 
(Lee et al., 2023).(see Table 5.)

reallocation of cholesterol and additional lipids to nerve cells by 
fastening to receptors on the cellular membrane. A clinical study dis -
played that carriers of the APOE ε 4 variant demonstrate heightened Aβ 
accumulation within the cerebral cortex (Mishra et al., 2018). APOE ε 2 
and APOE ε 3 are discovered to clear Aβ， but the influence of APOE ε 4 in 
propelling the process of AD and PD appears poised to surpass the 
protective impact of APOE ε 2 and APOE ε 3 (Jansen et al., 2015). Major 
approaches to treating Alzheimer’s disease by targeting APOE include 
modulating APOE’s expression levels, structure, receptors, or in -
teractions with other molecules such as amyloid-beta (reviewed in 
Table 6). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is 
predominantly expressed as a type-1 transmembrane protein, and it is 
targeted to the plasma membrane together with its co-receptor DAP12, 
has been prone to bind to APOE4 (Schlepckow et al., 2023). TREM2 
agonistic antibodies act by binding to the TREM2 receptor, activating its 
downstream SYK signaling pathway, thereby enhancing microglial 
chemotaxis and energy metabolism, increasing phagocytosis, and thus 
clearing pathological products such as Aβ (Ellwanger et al., 2021; Zhao 
et al., 2022a). 
6. Conclusions and prospect 
In conclusion, dysregulated lipid metabolism can lead to lipid 
accumulation and oxidative stress, which damages neurons and in -
creases the risk of AD and PD. Abnormalities in cholesterol, sphingoli -
pid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism are involved in the 
pathogenesis of both diseases. Abnormal lipid levels can directly accel -
erate the progression of AD by encouraging the deposition of Aβ as well 
as tau protein tangles. Indirectly, abnormal lipids can increase the 
burden on brain vasculature, induce insulin resistance, and affect the 
structure of neuronal cell membranes. Abnormal lipid metabolism leads 
to PD through inducing accumulation of α -syn, dysfunction of mito -
chondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and ferroptosis. Targeting specific 
steps in lipid pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies. However, 
more research is still needed to fully elucidate the molecular mecha -
nisms and identify potential drug targets. Future studies should further 
explore the interactions between lipid metabolism and other pathways 
implicated in neurodegeneration, such as protein aggregation and

mitochondrial dysfunction. Large clinical trials are also warranted to 
evaluate whether modulating lipid metabolism can alleviate disease 
symptoms or slow progression. It is suggested to utilize PET imaging and 
other molecular imaging techniques to longitudinally monitor changes 
in brain lipid metabolism in response to different therapeutic in -
terventions. Multi-target treatment strategies should be explored to 
better modulate lipid metabolism at different steps in the pathogenic 
pathway. Gaining more insight into the lipidological underpinnings of 
AD and PD could lead to the development of successful preventative and 
therapeutic strategies for these prevalent age-related neurodegenerative 
illnesses. 
What’s more, a recent study found that sex differences(Sex generally 
refers to a set of biological attributes that are associated with physical 
and physiological features) have a profound impact on the risk of AD 
and PD, with women having a higher probability of AD than men and a 
lower probability of PD than men (Podcasy and Epperson, 2016). This 
may be closely related to changes in estrogen in women. Estrogen is 
involved in brain lipid metabolism, and the instability of its level will 
affect the stability of lipid metabolism (Morselli et al., 2018). At the 
same time, the decreased level of circulating estrogen in post -
menopausal women is another risk factor for AD and is also intimately 
linked to the onset and progression of PD (Grimm et al., 2016; Picillo 
et al., 2017). Although there is no direct evidence to prove the mecha -
nism of estrogen involvement in AD and PD processes, we further 
speculate that the lipid metabolism disorder caused by the instability of 
estrogen levels in women is an important reason for the sex difference in 
the incidence of AD and PD. Therefore, future studies should further 
investigate the influence of sex on lipid dysregulation in AD and PD.

","Sphingomyelin levels amyloid-β deposition P-glycoprotein expression are linked in Alzheimer's disease. Ferroptosis involves peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by lipoxygenases and is associated with neuroinflammation and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-β by PPAR γ /RXR α -induced and CD36-mediated mechanisms improves cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Docosahexaenoic acid enhances α-synuclein neuropathology controlled by nuclear hormone receptors. Hypercholesterolemia is connected to Alzheimer’s via 27-hydroxycholesterol. Amyloid-β deposition, sphingomyelin level, and P-glycoprotein expression are interrelated in AD pathology.","Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are two of the most frequent neurological diseases. The clinical features of AD are memory decline and cognitive dysfunction, while PD mainly manifests as motor dysfunction such as limb tremors, muscle rigidity abnormalities, and slow gait. Abnormalities in cholesterol, sphingolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism have been demonstrated to directly exacerbate the progression of AD by stimulating Aβ deposition and tau protein tangles. Indirectly, abnormal lipids can increase the burden on brain vasculature, induce insulin resistance, and affect the structure of neuronal cell membranes. Abnormal lipid metabolism leads to PD through inducing accumulation of α-syn, dysfunction of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and ferroptosis. Great progress has been made in targeting lipid metabolism abnormalities for the treatment of AD and PD in recent years, like metformin, insulin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists, and monoclonal antibodies targeting apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This review comprehensively summarizes the involvement of dysregulated lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, the application of Lipid Monitoring, and emerging lipid regulatory drug targets. A better understanding of the lipidological bases of AD and PD may pave the way for developing effective prevention and treatment methods for neurodegenerative disorders.","Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are two of the most frequent neurological diseases (Aarsland et al., 2011). AD accounts for approximately 60–70% of dementia cases worldwide, with an estimated 50 million people currently living with the condition globally (Collaborators, 2019). The latest projections indicate worrisome trends regarding the growth of dementia cases worldwide. Data shows that by 2050, the global prevalence of dementia is estimated to nearly double from current levels. However, if defined according to biological rather than solely clinical criteria for AD, the predicted rise in dementia cases may be even greater, potentially tripling in scale based on the available data (Nowell et al., 2023; Scheltens et al., 2021). Furthermore, PD has a significant influence on human health as the second most prevalent neurological illness after AD. In short, AD and PD are imposing increasingly weighty socioeconomic burdens. Accordingly, identifying efficacious therapeutic solutions takes on vital importance. Lipid homeostasis dysfunction may pose a risk for AD and PD (Sarchione et al., 2021). Lipid metabolism disorders involve the accumulation of proteins caused by changes in lipid content and oxidative damage caused by lipid peroxidation, which are different from the metabolic behaviors of normal individuals. In the body fluid and brain tissue samples of AD and PD patients, we can detect differences in the levels of cholesterol, phospholipids, and other lipids between normal people and patients. The accumulation of abnormal tau protein and β-amyloid protein (Aβ) is the central feature of AD. The build-up of lipids like cholesterol and sphingolipid is linked to the accumulation of Aβ and tau protein (Flores-Leon and Outeiro, 2023; Hashemi et al., 2022). In addition, abnormal lipid metabolism may indirectly affect the onset of AD through secondary pathological mechanisms. α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation is the main feature of PD, and the accumulation of lipids such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cholesterol is involved in the misfolding and aggregation of α-syn (Sarchione et al., 2021). Abnormal attachment of α-syn to oxidized lipid metabolites also causes damage to organelles such as mitochondria (Ruipérez et al., 2010). Many studies have also found that lipid peroxidation is strongly associated with ferroptosis, which causes neuronal death (Pope and Dixon, 2023). As was previously mentioned, research shows a role for disruption of lipid homeostasis in the etiology and development of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. By targeting specific aspects of lipid metabolism, it may be possible to develop novel therapeutics that help restore metabolic balance in the brain and slow cognitive and motor decline. Great progress has been made in targeting lipid metabolism abnormalities in order to cure PD and AD in recent years. Some common antidiabetic drugs like metformin (Li et al., 2012), insulin (Kellar and Craft, 2020), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (Lourenco et al., 2013), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP4) inhibitors (Kosaraju et al., 2013) have shown potential therapeutic effects on AD and PD through enhancing brain synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. In addition, regulating key enzymes such as HMG-CoA reductase (Bar-On et al., 2008) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Vincent et al., 2018) can also affect cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and metabolism. Moreover, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists (Comerota et al., 2023; Sastre et al., 2003) can inhibit amyloidogenesis by improving insulin sensitivity. Monoclonal antibodies targeting lipid metabolism-related proteins like apolipoprotein E (ApoE) (Wang et al., 2018) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) (Zhao et al., 2022a) have demonstrated good anti-amyloidogenic effects by optimizing lipid transport and microglial cell functions respectively. This review comprehensively summarizes the participation of lipid metabolism in the development of AD and PD, the application of Lipid Monitoring, and emerging lipid regulatory drug targets. Greater knowledge of the lipidological roots of both AD and PD may pave the way for developing effective prevention and treatment methods for neurodegenerative disorders.","2.1.1. Elevated cholesterol levels One of the most typical features of AD is Aβ accumulation. Aβ is generated through the successive hydrolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the enzymes β-secretase and γ-secretase (Hur, 2022). Aβ formation is promoted by the up-regulation of lipids, particularly cholesterol in the brain, which increases the ability that APP to bind to β-secretase and γ-secretase (Mett, 2021; Wang et al., 2021). Furthermore, cholesterol impacts the polymerization of APP and γ-secretase’s processing of APP, leading to the generation of Aβ with diverse levels of toxicity and aggravation of Alzheimer’s Disease (Wu et al., 2022). High cholesterol levels in neurons encourage Aβ-induced oxidative stress in mitochondria and impede the fusion of the dysfunctional mitochondria with lysosomes (de Dios et al., 2023; Howe et al., 2022), which increases the number of dysfunctional mitochondria and causes nerve cell death (Roca-Agujetas et al., 2021). 2.1.2. Sphingolipid breakdown to ceramides Sphingolipids are a key component of lipid rafts and help regulate the production and accumulation of Aβ. Normal levels of sphingolipids inhibit the formation and buildup of Aβ peptides, thereby preventing Alzheimer’s disease progression. Research has found the increased breakdown of sphingomyelin, a type of sphingolipid, in the brains of AD patients. The enzyme sphingomyelinase catalyzes the breakdown of sphingomyelin to produce ceramides, which was shown to stabilize the accumulation of Aβ. Therefore, abnormal sphingomyelin breakdown in Alzheimer’s disease patients further exacerbates the accumulation of Aβ, leading to further worsening of AD, and the above process is also linked with sphingomyelinase activity (Czubowicz et al., 2019; Xing et al., 2023). 2.1.3. Other lipids Research has found that 27-hydroxycholesterol, a lipid that can easily pass the blood-brain barrier, increases expression of the enzyme β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which is known to play a significant part in Aβ production via causing the cleavage of APP. IκB phosphorylation and degradation were triggered by 27-OHC in SH-SY5Y cells at the molecular level, whose degradation product p65-p50 dimer was able to translocate to the BACE1 promoter region’s κB site in the nucleus, thereby upregulating the synthesis of BACE1 (Wu et al., 2022). Studies have shown omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can inhibit the activity of β-secretase and γ-secretase and can also increase the activity of α-secretase, (Chen et al., 2021), which may have the potential to reduce the formation and accumulation of toxic Aβ. Furthermore, it has been shown that certain ratios of phospholipid vesicle constituents contribute to the reduction of amyloid (Chaparro Sosa et al., 2020). This finding also points to a relationship between phospholipids and Aβ formation. 2.2. Abnormal lipid levels promote tangled tau protein In AD patients’ brains, levels of the tau protein are elevated and abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau comprises a significant proportion. Phosphorylated tau loses its normal function as supporting microtubule stability. This disrupts the cytoskeleton leading to defects in axonal transport and neural connectivity (Merrick et al., 1997). Studies have now linked imbalances in lipid metabolism to excessive tau phosphorylation. Disturbances to lipid metabolism can trigger inflammatory responses within the brain which promotes the formation and activation of different kinases and phosphatases involved in phosphorylation signaling cascades. Through these inflammatory mechanisms, imbalances in lipid processing may elevate tau phosphatase and kinase activity, thereby enhancing aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation (Chen and Yu, 2023; Ismail et al., 2020). Dysregulation of PI3K-Akt signaling, which can result from imbalances in phosphatidylinositol levels and structural integrity of lipid rafts, may therefore promote aberrant tau phospho-regulation at multiple nodes (Yang et al., 2020). This is achieved by activating downstream GSK3β and Cdk5, which function as tau phosphokinases (Yang et al., 2020). Cholesterol metabolism has additionally been linked to the modulation of tau phosphorylation levels. Research has shown depleting cholesterol levels within lipid rafts can activate the raft-dependent Ras/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, leading to phosphorylation of tau protein at multiple sites (Mai et al., 2022). This goes against what we previously concluded and therefore requires further investigation. 2.3. Imbalances in lipid metabolism indirectly accelerate AD Research indicates elevated cholesterol and imbalanced lipid processing increase the risk of atherosclerosis, whereby plaques accumulate within arteries. Over time, this atherogenic process can generate cerebrovascular lesions that diminish blood flow to the brain, exacerbating the underlying pathologies of AD (Cortes-Canteli and Iadecola, 2020).In addition, imbalanced lipid metabolism is linked to insulin resistance (Kerr et al., 2023), a driving factor behind impaired glucose metabolism. When energetic pathways are compromised by insulin insensitivity, neural excitability may become diminished. This could lead to dysregulated neurotransmitter release and reuptake (Sę dzikowska and Szablewski, 2021). Over time, sustained excitatory/inhibitory imbalance poses injury risks to neurons. Triacylglycerols and very low-density lipoproteins, as two markers of lipid metabolism, have been flagged as likely contributors to diminished insulin sensitivity based on their metabolic profiles (Rhee et al., 2011). Recent evidence points out that cholesterol is essential for maintaining typical synaptic architecture given its physical contribution to membrane composition. When cholesterol levels stray outside an optimal range, this destabilizes synaptic structures. Over time, such injuries to synaptic organization at the molecular level are likely to impair communication between neurons. If unaddressed, progressively deteriorating synapse structures and functions may therefore exacerbate disease progression (Li et al., 2022a). 3. Dysregulated lipid metabolism leads to PD Neuropathologically, a defining feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the presence of proteinaceous inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LB), comprised primarily of aggregates of the protein α-syn (Spillantini et al., 1997). Multiple biochemical processes are involved in PD, including mitochondrial or lysosomal malfunction and endoplasmic reticulum oxidative stress. In many recent studies, ferroptosis, a particular kind of lipid peroxidation-induced regulatory cell death, has also been gradually confirmed to be closely related to Parkinson’s disease (Dixon et al., 2012; Dong-Chen et al., 2023). Recently, researchers have observed changes in lipid metabolism in PD patients including sphingolipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis (Galper et al., 2022; Sinclair et al., 2021). Based on the above, we will discuss the connections between lipid metabolism and PD. 3.1. Abnormal lipid levels accelerate the accumulation of α-syn Lipid accumulation observed in patients with PD is involved in α-syn aggregation (see Fig. 2). Mutations in the GBA1 gene represent a major genetic risk factor for PD. GBA1 mutant reduces the activity of the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and leads to lysosomal dysfunction, therefore causing an abnormal build-up of cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Flores-Leon and Outeiro, 2023). PUFAs accumulate within cells due to lysosomal dysfunction and other reasons. The elevation of PUFA levels may impact the functioning of dopaminergic neurons by upregulating the expression of the α-syn gene and promoting the oligomerization of α-syn and the formation of toxic oligomers, thereby increasing the risk of PD (Assayag et al., 2007; Yakunin et al., 2012). At the same time, high levels of fatty acids can also cause α-syn aggregation, thus participating in the formation of LB (Erskine et al., 2021). The interaction between α-syn and cellular membranes may facilitate its transformation from benign, soluble forms to toxic, insoluble aggregates (Marschallinger et al., 2020). Cholesterol-rich domains such as lipid rafts may be the focal points for α-syn aggregation. Cholesterol is also thought to regulate the binding of α-syn to synaptic vesicle-like structures, potentially triggering their aggregation (Galvagnion, 2017; García-Sanz, 2021). Recent findings indicate levels of the lipid transport apolipoprotein (ApoE) are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of early PD patients. As ApoE encodes a protein that mediates lipid trafficking, this suggests α-syn may augment its spread between neurons by interacting with ApoE (Paslawski et al., 2019). 3.2. Abnormal lipid levels lead to dysfunction of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum Lipid metabolism disorders such as fatty acids and cardiolipin participate in mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, which leads to dysfunction of neurons and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Excessive lipid accumulation can induce mitochondria-cytoplasmic stress response (MCSR), and the resulting ROS preferentially targets PUFAs, leading to the occurrence of PUFA peroxidation, thereby altering mitochondrial permeability and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Kim et al., 2016). Research has established that Elovl2 is a key endoplasmic reticulum-located very long-chain fatty acid elongase. Deficiency of Elovl2 may result in impaired fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of short-chain fatty acids within the endoplasmic reticulum. The build-up of free fatty acids in the endoplasmic reticulum damages its function, leading to increased unfolded or misfolded protein load, chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress, and elevated risk of mitochondrial dysfunction (Li et al., 2022c). There has been evidence of a decrease in SIRT6 activity in the brains of PD patients (Stein et al., 2021). Research has shown that a deficiency of SIRT6 can lead to decreased mitochondrial gene expression, elevating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial decay, thereby initiating mitochondrial dysfunction (Smirnov et al., 2023). In addition, disruption to mitochondrial lipid metabolism could further influence mitochondrial structure and function. Cardiolipin (CL) is a glycerophospholipid that is present in the mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotic cells (van Meer et al., 2008). Misfolded α-syn interacting with cardiolipin has the potential to compromise the integrity of mitochondrial membranes and thereby impair mitochondrial function (Ghio et al., 2016). Additionally, research has revealed that CL mediated the targeted autophagy of abnormal mitochondria, abnormal CL content could hinder mitochondrial autophagy, and abnormal mitochondrial aggregation could trigger inflammation through the NLRP3 inflammasome and/or cGAS-cgamp-STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway, further aggravation of neuronal cell damage (Chu et al., 2013; Doblado et al., 2021; Hsu and Shi, 2017; Tansey et al., 2022). Hence, it can be inferred that there is a delicate balance between cardiolipin (CL), mitochondria, and Parkinson’s disease. Abnormal CL metabolism can lead to Parkinson’s disease by affecting mitochondrial function or inhibiting abnormal mitochondrial autophagy. The disorder of lipid metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes is also closely related to PD (Bantle et al., 2020). Toxic fatty acids (FAs) generated in hyperactive neurons are transported to astrocyte lipid droplets via APOE-positive lipid particles and consumed through mitochondrial beta-oxidation for detoxification (Ioannou et al., 2019). Pathogenic α-syn is involved in astrocyte mitochondrial dysfunction (Braidy et al., 2013). Mitochondrial dysfunction of astrocytes can reduce FA metabolism, make neurons poisoned by FA, and aggravate the PD process. 3.3. Dysregulated lipid metabolism leads to ferroptosis Parkinson’s disease-related dopaminergic neuronal degeneration is linked to ferroptosis, which is primarily brought on by problems in lipid metabolism (Dixon et al., 2012). Given the high lipid content in brain tissue, the central nervous system may be particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage caused by lipid peroxidation. Unrestricted lipid peroxidation is a hallmark of ferroptosis, and lipid peroxidation products play a key role in Parkinson’s disease (Gaschler and Stockwell, 2017; Yang et al., 2016). PUFAs accumulated in PD patients are the main substrates for these peroxidation processes, and the elevated levels of peroxide substrates such as ceramide and lysophosphatidylcholine produced by peroxidation can lead to cellular oxidative damage, resulting in ferroptosis (Yan et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2016). Lipid peroxidation produces lipid free radicals and lipid peroxyl free radicals, which react with PUFAs to produce lipid peroxides, which further aggravate the oxidation process of PUFAs and accelerate the occurrence of ferroptosis (Stockwell et al., 2017). The oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) and other polyunsaturated fatty acids in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) of the cell membrane can damage the membrane and induce ferroptosis (Astudillo et al., 2023). In the condition of lipid metabolism disorders, glutathione peroxidase 4(GPX4) plays a role in alleviating ferroptosis by converting lipid peroxides into lipid alcohols. GPX4 activity decreased, and the antioxidant capacity of cells decreased, making PUFAs more easily oxidized, indirectly aggravating the process of ferroptosis (Costa et al., 2023). Therefore, PD may arise as a result of abnormalities in lipid metabolism by affecting the process of desferrioxia. Taken above, it is not difficult to see that lipid metabolism plays an important role in the accumulation of α-syn, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. However, these effects do not exist independently in the pathogenesis of PD. Ferroptosis can affect the metabolism of α-syn and lead to its accumulation (Castellani et al., 2000). Accumulation of α-syn can also cause mitochondrial dysfunction (Ordonez et al., 2018). This vicious cycle causes the degree of Parkinson’s disease to gradually worsen, demonstrating the important role of lipid metabolism in the pathogenic process of Parkinson’s disease. 4. Application of lipid monitoring in AD and PD Previously, we summarized the relationship between lipid metabolism and AD and PD. A large number of studies have found that the levels of lipids and their metabolites in brain tissue and body fluids of AD and PD patients are different from those of healthy individuals or special patients with the disease (see Table 1 and Table 2). In AD patients, research has revealed that the degree of major membrane phospholipids in patients’ brains is considerably less than what was observed in the control group, and the related metabolites are increased. Monitoring the degree of phospholipid degeneration of brain cell membranes is an important index to judge the development of AD (Nitsch et al., 1992). At the same time, the detection results of lipid levels in AD patients are also different for different races. Ethnic background also has an impact on lipid levels in AD patients, and lipid monitoring also has racial significance (Khan et al., 2022). For patients with AD, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most prevalent type of sleep breathing disturbance. Plasma lipidomics is significantly different in these two types of patients (general AD patients versus AD patients with OSA), so lipid monitoring can be used to diagnose AD and severe OSA patients, permitting personalized management of these individuals (Dakterzada et al., 2022). In the serum of PD patients, the proportion of most lipids is too high compared with the control group, and the difference in related metabolites can feedback the metabolic process in Parkinson’s disease. According to the monitored lipid changes, it can be inferred that 20 PD-related pathways such as carnitine shuttling, vitamin E metabolism, glycerol, sphingolipid, fatty acids, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis have significant changes (Pereira et al., 2022). Additionally, lipid profiling can correlate specific lipid compositional features with the severity of PD. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is used to assess symptom severity, with higher scores indicating more serious manifestations. Research shows that higher levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and dihydro globotriaosylceramide (dhGB3) correlate positively with increased UPDRS scores and more severe PD symptoms. Meanwhile, elevated dihydrosphingomyelin (dhSM) and plasmenylethanolamine (PEp) are associated with lower UPDRS scoring and comparatively milder presentations of the disease (Avisar et al., 2021). From the standpoint of brain structure and function, brain imaging methods include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), positron emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can noninvasively identify changes in brain biomarkers (Rathore et al., 2017).In recent years, brain imaging biomarker genomics and metabolomics have been extensively utilized in the diagnosis and assessment of disease staging of AD and PD (Li et al., 2022b). In addition, there is increasing evidence that the lipidomic markers are increasingly supporting the diagnosis, prognosis, and detection of therapeutic effects of AD and PD (Chiurchiù et al., 2022). Therefore, we believe that brain imaging technology can be further used to monitor the lipid changes in the occurrence and treatment response of AD and PD, providing a new direction for future clinical research. 5. Therapeutic approaches targeted lipid metabolism Taken above, it is becoming more widely acknowledged that lipid metabolic abnormalities are a major contributing factor in the etiology of AD and PD. Here we summarize the therapeutic approaches that have been explored so far to modulate lipid metabolic dysfunction in AD and PD. 5.1. Dietary supplements and related enzymes To treat AD and PD, dietary supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have shown therapeutic promise (Strike et al., 2016). PUFA supplementation improves hippocampus synaptic plasticity (Nagaraja et al., 2021) and ameliorates (Strike et al., 2016) cognitive deficits in AD animal models. Activation of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) by natural ligands, including 9-cis retinoic acid, and DHA plays a role in these positive effects (Casali et al., 2015; de Urquiza et al., 2000). Epidemiologically, increased intake of ω-3 PUFAs, particularly DHA and EPA, is associated with a reduced risk of AD, while lower ω-3 PUFA intake increases the risk (Zhang et al., 2016) In this case, some enzyme inhibitors play a therapeutic role by inhibiting the lipid metabolism process of the enzyme (see Table 3). For example, the activity and expression of phospholipase A2 in AD are altered. Increased PLA2 activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients is accompanied by an increase in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which is associated with increased inflammation(Fonteh et al., 2013). Different PLA2 subtypes have different effects on membrane remodeling and function (Chew et al., 2020). Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) increases the severity of AD by oxidizing LDL and hydrolyzing it into two biologically active products, thereby promoting inflammation (Huang et al., 2020). The application of Lp-PLA2 inhibitors may play a good role in the treatment of AD (Acharya et al., 2013). The increase of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) enzyme activity mainly releases arachidonic acid, thus promoting the progress of the AD pathway, while reducing the ability of microglia to phagocytose Aβ in AD brain, thus further promoting the pathogenesis of the disease (Khan and Ilies, 2023). Therefore, relevant inhibitors may play a role in reducing the course of AD by blocking these pathways(Schaeffer et al., 2011). 5.2. Antidiabetic drugs Antidiabetic drugs have beneficial effects beyond glycemic control, as they are also able to regulate lipid metabolism. As diabetes shares certain pathophysiological similarities with neurodegenerative diseases like AD and PD, researchers have explored whether existing antidiabetic therapies may also benefit these conditions (see Table 4). Metformin is a first-line treatment for diabetes and it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and build up to therapeutic amounts in the brain, according to studies. Metformin has gained interest for its potential neuroprotective effects in AD and PD through its ability to activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Li et al., 2012; Mor et al., 2020). As a key metabolic hormone, insulin (Kellar and Craft, 2020; Novak et al., 2019) improves brain cognition and synaptic plasticity in AD and PD. Further, thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) improve insulin sensitivity by stimulating PPARs (see Table 4). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (Lourenco et al., 2013; Yun et al., 2018) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) (Cao et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2018) are secreted by enteroendocrine L cells in the intestine in response to nutrient ingestion and could promote the release of insulin. Inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is an enzyme that can rapidly degrade GLP-1 within two minutes (Kosaraju et al., 2013; Nassar et al., 2015), thus preserving active levels of endogenous GLP-1. 5.3. Targeting nuclear receptor superfamily The nuclear receptor superfamily controls the expression of target genes by binding to element-specific sequences located at gene promoter regions, regulating inflammation, energy balance, as well as lipid and glucose metabolism (Moutinho and Landreth, 2017). Due to their ability to lower toxic lipid products, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, and potential neuroprotective benefits, activating these receptors with specific agonists shows great promise for AD (Moutinho and Landreth, 2017). The retinoid bexarotene synthetic agonist, which the FDA licensed for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is a potent agonist of the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and has been shown to alleviate cognitive impairments in AD (Cramer et al., 2012; Savage et al., 2015). Among all the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), PPAR-α uniquely impacts excitatory cholinergic/dopaminergic signaling and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain. It also regulates mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and oxidative stress (Comerota et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2020). PPAR-γ is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cell differentiation relating to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory processes (Sastre et al., 2003; Yamanaka et al., 2012). PPAR-β/δ presides over the processes of myelination, lipid metabolism, and cellular differentiation (Chamberlain et al., 2020). Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (REV-ERB α) is extensively involved in the regulation of the biological clock as well as the control of glucose metabolism and triglyceride levels (Lee et al., 2023).(see Table 5.) 5.4. Targeting APOE and TREM Apolipoprotein E (APOE) fulfills an important function in the reallocation of cholesterol and additional lipids to nerve cells by fastening to receptors on the cellular membrane. A clinical study displayed that carriers of the APOE ε4 variant demonstrate heightened Aβ accumulation within the cerebral cortex (Mishra et al., 2018). APOE ε2 and APOE ε3 are discovered to clear Aβ, but the influence of APOE ε4 in propelling the process of AD and PD appears poised to surpass the protective impact of APOE ε2 and APOE ε3 (Jansen et al., 2015). Major approaches to treating Alzheimer’s disease by targeting APOE include modulating APOE’s expression levels, structure, receptors, or interactions with other molecules such as amyloid-beta (reviewed in Table 6). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is predominantly expressed as a type-1 transmembrane protein, and it is targeted to the plasma membrane together with its co-receptor DAP12, has been prone to bind to APOE4 (Schlepckow et al., 2023). TREM2 agonistic antibodies act by binding to the TREM2 receptor, activating its downstream SYK signaling pathway, thereby enhancing microglial chemotaxis and energy metabolism, increasing phagocytosis, and thus clearing pathological products such as Aβ (Ellwanger et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022a). 6. Conclusions and prospect In conclusion, dysregulated lipid metabolism can lead to lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, which damages neurons and increases the risk of AD and PD. Abnormalities in cholesterol, sphingolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Abnormal lipid levels can directly accelerate the progression of AD by encouraging the deposition of Aβ as well as tau protein tangles. Indirectly, abnormal lipids can increase the burden on brain vasculature, induce insulin resistance, and affect the structure of neuronal cell membranes. Abnormal lipid metabolism leads to PD through inducing accumulation of α-syn, dysfunction of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and ferroptosis. Targeting specific steps in lipid pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies. However, more research is still needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms and identify potential drug targets. Future studies should further explore the interactions between lipid metabolism and other pathways implicated in neurodegeneration, such as protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Large clinical trials are also warranted to evaluate whether modulating lipid metabolism can alleviate disease symptoms or slow progression. It is suggested to utilize PET imaging and other molecular imaging techniques to longitudinally monitor changes in brain lipid metabolism in response to different therapeutic interventions. Multi-target treatment strategies should be explored to better modulate lipid metabolism at different steps in the pathogenic pathway. Gaining more insight into the lipidological underpinnings of AD and PD could lead to the development of successful preventative and therapeutic strategies for these prevalent age-related neurodegenerative illnesses. What’s more, a recent study found that sex differences(Sex generally refers to a set of biological attributes that are associated with physical and physiological features) have a profound impact on the risk of AD and PD, with women having a higher probability of AD than men and a lower probability of PD than men (Podcasy and Epperson, 2016). This may be closely related to changes in estrogen in women. Estrogen is involved in brain lipid metabolism, and the instability of its level will affect the stability of lipid metabolism (Morselli et al., 2018). At the same time, the decreased level of circulating estrogen in post-menopausal women is another risk factor for AD and is also intimately linked to the onset and progression of PD (Grimm et al., 2016; Picillo et al., 2017). Although there is no direct evidence to prove the mechanism of estrogen involvement in AD and PD processes, we further speculate that the lipid metabolism disorder caused by the instability of estrogen levels in women is an important reason for the sex difference in the incidence of AD and PD. Therefore, future studies should further investigate the influence of sex on lipid dysregulation in AD and PD."

Abstract  
Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease affecting older adults. Primary 
features of Alzheimer’s disease include extracellular aggregation of amyloid-β plaques and the 
accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, formed by tau protein, in the cells. While there are amyloid-
β-targeting therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, these therapies are costly and exhibit 
potential negative side effects. Mounting evidence suggests significant involvement of tau protein 
in Alzheimer’s disease-related neurodegeneration. As an important microtubule-associated protein, 
tau plays an important role in maintaining the stability of neuronal microtubules and promoting 
axonal growth. In fact, clinical studies have shown that abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein 
occurs before accumulation of amyloid-β in the brain. Various therapeutic strategies targeting tau 
protein have begun to emerge, and are considered possible methods to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s 
disease. Specifically, abnormalities in post-translational modifications of the tau protein, including 
aberrant phosphorylation, ubiquitination, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation, acetylation, 
and truncation, contribute to its microtubule dissociation, misfolding, and subcellular missorting. 
This causes mitochondrial damage, synaptic impairments, gliosis, and neuroinflammation, eventually 
leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits. This review summarizes the recent findings on 
the underlying mechanisms of tau protein in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease and 
discusses tau-targeted treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

Introduction 
Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, maintains microtubule stability in 
neurons and promotes axonal growth. Under physiological conditions, 
hypophosphorylated tau is localized in the axons of neurons. Neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs) made of accumulated tau protein and senile plaques made 
of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) are the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD; 
Wang and Liu, 2008). Significant advancement in understanding the role 
of tau toxicity in the pathogenesis of AD has been made in the past few 
decades. Studies have shown that post-translational modifications (PTMs), 
such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, small ubiquitin-like 
modifier (SUMO)ylation, and truncation of tau protein participate in its 
stability, misfolding, accumulation, and degradation (Wang and Liu, 2008). 
Accumulation of tau protein in cells leads to cognitive deficits, such as 
mitochondrial dysfunction, the impairment of synaptic plasticity, gliosis, 
and neuroinflammation via multiple pathways (Wang and Liu, 2008). In this 
review, we summarize the role of tau protein in these processes. Moreover, 
we provide an overview of tau toxicity in synaptic plasticity, memory, and 
learning in AD. Finally, we discuss the application potential of tau protein as 
a therapeutic target for ameliorating AD-related cognitive deficits and other 
related tauopathies.

Transcriptions, Domains, and Structures of Tau
The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene encodes for tau protein 
is located on chromosome 17 (17q21–q22) in humans (Wang and Liu, 2008). 
In the adult human brain, six isoforms of tau protein, namely 0N3R, 1N3R, 
2N3R, 0N4R, 1N4R, and 2N4R, are generated by selective splicing of exons 2, 
3, and 10 (Neve et al., 1986). The alternative splicing of exons 2 and 3 leads 
to differences in the N-terminal inserts of these tau isoforms, known as 0N, 
1N, and 2N, while the alternative splicing of exon 10 results in tau protein 
containing three or four microtubule-binding repeat domains (MBDs; 3R or 
4R; Figure 1). The 3R to 4R tau ratio in the healthy adult brain is nearly 1:1, 
whereas in primary tauopathies, the alternative splicing of exon 10 leads 
to 3R tau or 4R tau dominant pathological lesions in different tauopathies 
(Delacourte et al., 1998; Sergeant et al., 1999).
Tau protein is intrinsically disordered, and its higher-order structure is still 
unknown. The N- and C-terminal amino acid residues of tau are mainly 
acidic and neutral, respectively. The four domains of tau protein are the 
N-terminal projection, the proline-rich domain, the C-terminal assembly, and 
the MBDs. Several studies have shown that the N-terminal projection domain 
of tau extends from the microtubule and links it to the plasma membrane 
of neurons (Derisbourg et al., 2015; Gauthier-Kemper et al., 2018). The 
proline-rich domain contains multiple Ser/Thr phosphorylation motifs that 
bind Src homology 3 domains of proteins, such as tyrosine kinase Fyn (Lee 
et al., 1998). The binding affinity between the tau protein and microtubules 
is determined by MBD, which is encoded by exons 9–12 and contains four 
repeats (R1–4) (Kar et al., 2003; Cao and Mao, 2009). Due to R2, an additional 
repeat domain, the 4R isoform demonstrates higher affinity and efficiency in 
assembling microtubules compared to the 3R isoform (Goedert and Jakes, 
1990). When tau aggregates into paired helical filaments (PHFs), the MBD 
forms the core region of the PHF , and the C-terminal and the long N-terminal 
domains project around the core region. Despite the use of modern 
techniques, imaging of the structure of PHF has proven challenging. Recently, 
with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies, such as 
alpha-Fold, the prediction model of tau protein 3D structure has injected 
new life into the analysis of tau higher-order structure (Sathish Kumar and 
Kannan, 2021). A study showed that the 3D structure of tau protein predicted 
by ab-initio modeling can generate various PTMs, bringing new insights into 
the understanding of tau structure and related tau pathology (Ahmad et al., 
2020).

 Review
In humans, the tau protein undergoes 95 types of PTMs, including 
ubiquitination, phosphorylation, nitration, truncation, acetylation, 
methylation, O-GlcNAcylation, glycation, glycosylation, SUMOylation, and 
isomerization. Some PTMs, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and 
glycosylation, occur under both physiological and pathological conditions. 
However, some of these PTM sites show critical pathological significance and 
thus, have attracted much attention (Figure 2). Specifically, a recent study that 
analyzed the PTM profile of tau found that these PTMs occur in a processive 
fashion, reflecting AD progression (Wesseling et al., 2020).
on the recognized motif in the tau sequence: proline-directed protein kinases, 
tyrosine protein kinases, and non-proline-directed protein kinases. Proline-
directed protein kinases consist of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-
3β), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), CDK2, p38 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase families. These proline-directed protein 
kinases phosphorylate the tau protein at Ser or Thr and proline residues (Ser/
Thr-Pro). Non-proline-directed protein kinases consist of Ca 2+/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent 
protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase B, protein kinase N, casein kinase 1/2, 
tau-tubulin kinase 1/2, dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated 
kinase 1A, phosphorylase kinases, and microtubule affinity-regulating kinases. 
Tyrosine protein kinases, including the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Brody 
et al., 2022), Fyn lymphocyte-specific protein, and spleen tyrosine kinases 
belonging to the Src family and the Abelson (ABL) family members (ABL2 
and ABL1) can all phosphorylate tau. Studies have shown an increase in GSK-
3β, CDK5, tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A, casein kinase 1/2, 
p38, and Fyn expression levels in AD brains (Shirazi and Wood, 1993; Wang et 
al., 2014; Rosenberger et al., 2016). Of these, GSK-3β and CDK5 have gained 
significant interest. Numerous studies have shown colocalization of GSK-3β, 
CDK5, and pathological tau in AD brains. GSK-3β and CDK5 can phosphorylate 
tau at several sites associated with AD, including Ser202, Thr212, Ser214, 
Ser404, Ser217, Thr205, Thr231, Ser235, Thr231, and Ser396 (Takahashi 
et al., 2000; Ferrer et al., 2002; Wegmann et al., 2021). Studies have also 
shown that inhibition of CDK5 reduces tau phosphorylation and related 
neurodegeneration in transgenic mice (Sundaram et al., 2013; Seo et al., 
2017). Moreover, downregulating GSK-3β activity or using GSK-3β inhibitors 
showed similar beneficial effects (Zhang et al., 2014a; Shi et al., 2019; Zhou et 
al., 2022).
Protein kinases and phosphatases dynamically control tau phosphorylation 
levels. Five protein phosphatases, including phosphatase (PP)1, PP2A, 
PP2B, PP2C, and PP5, are highly expressed in the mammalian brain and can 
dephosphorylate tau. Moreover, nearly 70% of the phosphatase activity 
related to tau in the human brain is regulated by PP2A. Interestingly, an 
approximate 20% and 40% decrease in PP2A activity was observed in the gray 
and white matter in AD brains, respectively (Gong et al., 1993). However, the 
mechanism underlying PP2A inactivation in AD is not fully understood. Studies 
have shown several mechanisms involved in PP2A inactivation, including 
PTMs of the PP2A catalytic domain, lowered mRNA and protein expression of 
PP2A catalytic/regulatory subunits, and elevated levels of endogenous PP2A 
inhibitor, I1PP2A, I2PP2A, and cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A) (Sontag et 
al., 2004; Liu et al., 2012, 2013). A study has shown that either okadaic acid or 
homocysteine-mediated PP2A inhibition could induce hyperphosphorylation 
of tau and memory deficits in animal models (Zhang et al., 2008). 
Moreover, silencing I2PP2A or inhibiting CIP2A expression could decrease 
hyperphosphorylation of tau and improve memory deficits (Liu et al., 2013; 
Zhang et al., 2014a; Shentu et al., 2018). In addition, CIP2A overexpression in 
primary neurons induces mislocalization of tau in the dendrites and synaptic 
degeneration, which may be the underlying mechanism of PP2A inhibition-
induced defects in memory (Shentu et al., 2018). Furthermore, studies have 
shown an interaction between GSK-3β and PP2A. For instance, our studies 
have shown that GSK-3β regulates PP2A activity by increasing I2PP2A levels, 
promoting the phosphorylation of inhibitory Tyr307 residue, as well as the 
demethylation of the inhibitory Leu-309 residue of the PP2A catalytic subunit 
(Liu et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2011, 2012).
Although hyperphosphorylation of tau is a hallmark pathology of AD and 
other neurological diseases, the detailed phosphorylation sites of tau may 
act conversely in its physiological and pathological function. For instance, 
tau phosphorylation at Ser202 and Thr231 mediated by GSK-3β and CDK5 
promotes tau aggregation, NFT formation, and synaptic impairments 
(Takahashi et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 2018). In a preclinical study, PNT001, a 
humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes cis-Thr231 tau, markedly 
reduced NFT formation and tau seeding activity with improved synaptic and 
cognitive functions (Foster et al., 2023). In Huntington’s disease models, 
12 weeks of treatment of the monoclonal antibody CP13, which targets 
Ser202 of tau protein, improved motor and cognitive impairments, as well 
as general health (Alpaugh et al., 2022). In contrast, tau phosphorylation 
at Thr205 mediated by P38γ can protect against Aβ-induced cell death, 
neuronal circuit aberrations, and memory deficits in early AD (Ittner et al., 
2016); moreover, P38γ-mediated tau phosphorylation at Thr205 can reduce 
seizure susceptibility (Morey et al., 2022). These studies suggest that different 
tau phosphorylation sites play distinct roles in tau pathology and cognitive 
dysfunction. Thus, choosing suitable antigen epitopes when targeting tau 
phosphorylation may help improve the safety and effectiveness of targeted 
drugs. 
Tau acetylation
A recent study has shown acetylation as a novel PTM of the tau protein 
(Caballero et al., 2021). The tau protein with > 20 lysine residues 
undergoes acetylation, primarily in the proline-rich domain and MDB. P300 
acetyltransferase and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element 
binding (CREB)-binding protein are identified as tau acetyltransferases. The 
mechanisms of acetylation in tau pathogenesis can be residue- and context-
specific. Studies have shown that acetylation at Lys163, Lys281, Lys274, 
Lys280, Lys174, and Lys369 residues prevents tau degradation (Min et al., 
2010; Caballero et al., 2021). Additionally, the acetylation on KXGS motifs 
(Lys259, Lys290, Lys321, and Lys353) inhibits phosphorylation and prevents 
aggregation of tau (Cook et al., 2014). Interestingly, tau also processes intrinsic 
enzymatic activity and catalyzes auto-acetylation at Lys280 residue via the

Tau PTMs from Alzheimer’s disease patients mapped on the longest isoform of tau 
(tau441). Phosphorylation is the major PTM of tau protein, with 55 phosphorylation 
sites distributed heterogeneously in the tau sequence. The proline rich domain (amino 
acids 151–243) contains multiple Thr-Pro or Ser-Pro motifs that are targets of proline-
directed protein kinases, such as GSK-3β, CDK5, JNK, and MAPK. The C-terminal is 
frequently phosphorylated by proline-directed protein kinases and non-proline-directed 
protein kinases, including PKA and dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated 
kinase 1A. Acetylation and ubiquitination are confined mostly in the microtubule-binding 
repeat domain. Tau has 19 lysine residues in the microtubule-binding repeat domain, of 
which a large amount is subjected to both acetylation and ubiquitination. Methylations 
are seen only on the N- and C-terminals of tau sequence. Created with Microsoft Office

Tau phosphorylation
One of the most extensively studied PTMs of tau protein in AD and other 
related tauopathies is phosphorylation. In physiological conditions, 
phosphorylation regulates the affinity of tau to microtubules, thus controlling 
their stabilization and assembly (Xie et al., 1998). Studies have shown 
that tau phosphorylation is developmentally regulated. The levels of tau 
phosphorylation are significantly higher during the embryonic and early 
developmental stages (nearly eight phosphates/molecule) compared to tau 
phosphorylation in adults (approximately two phosphates per molecule). 
Moreover, the phosphorylation level of tau is high in the aged brain 
(approximately eight phosphates/molecule) (Kanemaru et al., 1992; Köpke et 
al., 1993).
The longest tau isoform (2N4R) has approximately 80 potential serine and 
threonine phosphorylation sites. One study identified nearly 40 of these 
phosphorylation sites in AD ( Figure 2 ; Wang et al., 2014). Multiple protein 
kinases regulate these phosphorylation site clusters in the flanking region 
related to diseases. Tau protein kinases are divided into three groups based  NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH｜Vol 19｜No. 7｜July 2024｜1491

Review
catalytic cysteine residues in MBD (Cohen et al., 2013). Mass spectrometry 
has shown an increase in the acetylation at Lys174 residue of tau in the 
brains of patients with AD (Min et al., 2015). Studies have also observed 
high acetylation levels at Lys274, Lys280, and Lys281 residues of tau in the 
brains of hAPP-J20 and PS19 mice (Cohen et al., 2013; Tracy et al., 2016). 
Recently, the monoclonal antibody Y01, which specially targets Lys280 of tau, 
showed significant therapeutic effects on tau accumulation, tau propagation, 
and cognitive deficits in a tau transgenic mice model (Song et al., 2023), 
elucidating the importance of choosing appropriate lysine residues when 
targeting tau. Additionally, sirtuin1 and histone deacetylase 6 can deacetylate 
tau protein. Histone deacetylase 6 aggregates with tau, deacetylating it at 
certain lysine residues (e.g., Lys311) in the brains of patients with AD, while 
the deletion of histone deacetylase 6 accelerates tau pathology and cognitive 
decline (Trzeciakiewicz et al., 2020); the inhibition of sirtuin1 expression 
demonstrates similar results (Min et al., 2010). A recent study has shown 
that acetylation at Lys263 and Lys270 residues of tau in mice (corresponding 
to tau Lys274 and Lys281 in humans) could lead to a critical pathological 
convergence from traumatic brain injury to AD. A decrease in the incidence 
of traumatic brain injury and AD was observed in patients receiving p300/CBP 
inhibitors, such as salsalate or diflunisal (Shin et al., 2021). Thus, targeting tau 
acetylation could be a novel therapeutic approach for treating tauopathies in 
humans.
Tau ubiquitination
Ubiquitination is a three-step enzymatic reaction for transferring one 
or more ubiquitin subunits to lysine residues, and consists of ubiquitin-
activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-
ligating enzyme (E3). The longest 2N4R isoform has > 20 ubiquitylation 
sites in the proline-rich domain and MBD of the tau protein (Li et al., 2021). 
In most cases, ubiquitination promotes tau degradation via the ubiquitin-
proteasomal system. One study found that CHIP-mediated Lys48-linked 
polyubiquitination is the most common type of tau ubiquitination and 
promotes tau proteasomal degradation (Petrucelli et al., 2004). Additionally, 
Lys63-linked polyubiquitination mediated by tumor necrosis factor receptor-
associated factor 6 enhances proteasomal-targeted tau clearance (Puangmalai 
et al., 2022). Accumulation of non-aggregated, ubiquitin-negative, 
hyperphosphorylated tau was observed in CHIP knockout mice (Sahara et al., 
2005). However, a separate study found that hyper-ubiquitination increases 
tau aggregation (Kim et al., 2021). Furthermore, multiple studies have 
revealed high levels of ubiquitination in PHFs of tau in AD brains (Morishima-
Kawashima et al., 1993; Cripps et al., 2006; Arakhamia et al., 2020). These 
findings suggest significant involvement of ubiquitination in tau pathology. 
Recent studies have demonstrated that deubiquitinases, such as X-linked 
ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10), USP11, and USP13, increase the 
aggregation of tau, enhance vulnerability to tauopathy, and delay tau 
degradation by deubiquitinating tau (Liu et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2022; Yan et 
al., 2022). Additionally, ubiquitination also inhibits tau-mediated microtubule 
assembly (Munari et al., 2020). Therefore, targeting ubiquitination could 
aid in managing patients with AD and related tauopathies. However, the 
roles, sites, and types of ubiquitination mediated by different E3 ligases and 
deubiquitinases in tau pathology and AD require further investigation.
Tau SUMOylation
During SUMOylation, SUMO proteins are covalently attached to specific 
lysine residues of target proteins. SUMOylation at the Lys340 residue of tau 
protein is primarily observed in AD brains and has been shown to inhibit the 
degradation of tau by competing with ubiquitination for tau modification (Luo 
et al., 2014). Three SUMOs are expressed in the mammalian brain. SUMO1 
preferentially SUMOylates the tau protein when compared to SUMOs 2 and 3. 
Immunohistochemistry results have shown the colocalization of SUMO1 and 
pathological tau in progressive supranuclear palsy (Takamura et al., 2022). 
High SUMO1 expression levels promote tau phosphorylation at multiple AD-
associated sites, like Thr205, Ser214, Ser262, Ser396, Thr231, and Ser404 
(Luo et al., 2014). Additionally, tau SUMOylation can be induced after 
hyperphosphorylation, followed by treatment with okadaic acid or colchicine 
(Dorval and Fraser, 2006), suggesting an interplay between tau SUMOylation 
and phosphorylation. 
Multiple correlations exist between various tau PTMs, such as SUMOylation, 
acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. Several lysine residues of the 
tau protein undergo acetylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination. Therefore, 
the addition of one chemical group to a given residue will compete with the 
addition of another group, thereby indicating a multilayered and dynamic 
characteristic of tau biology. One study found that removing ubiquitin allows 
for enzymatic acetylation of tau at Lys281 and 274 residues (Yan et al., 2022). 
High levels of SUMOylation inhibit ubiquitination and degradation of tau (Luo 
et al., 2014). Another study has shown the involvement of SUMOylation in tau 
phosphorylation, and that a mimic mutation at the K430R site (SUMOylation 
site) attenuates hyperphosphorylation of tau (Luo et al., 2014). Acetylation 
at different sites regulate the phosphorylation of tau in different ways. For 
instance, acetylation at K280 increases phosphorylation of tau at Ser199/202, 
Thr231, Ser202/Thr205, and Ser422 (Kim et al., 2022). However, pseudo-
acetylation of Lys163, Lys280, Lys281, and Lys369 significantly decreases 
the phosphorylation of tau in humans (Gorsky et al., 2017). Moreover, 
after traumatic brain injury, increased acetylation was not associated with 
phosphorylation level of tau (Shin et al., 2021). A recent study has shown 
that deubiquitination of tau by ubiquitin-specific protease 11 promotes 
aggregation and hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser199 and Ser202/Thr205  
residues (Wei et al., 2022). Conversely, tau hyperphosphorylation inhibits its 
degradation, which is closely correlated with SUMOylation, acetylation, and 
ubiquitination of tau. 
Tau truncation
Tau truncation has been observed in AD and other tauopathies, which 
plays a crucial role in tau aggregation and neurodegeneration (Kang et al., 
2020a). Truncated tau proteins, such as Tau 1–314, Tau1–368, and Tau 1–421, show 
enhanced aggregation, mislocalization in dendrites, and propagation. Mass 
spectrometry results have shown cleavage of tau at Asp13 and Asp421 by 
caspases 6 and 3 in vitro . Additionally, colocalization of caspase3-truncated 
tau and NFTs has been observed in AD brains (Wai et al., 2009; Lee and Shea, 
2012). One study found that caspase 2-mediated truncation of tau at Asp314 
residue promotes missorting of tau to dendritic spines and could cause 
reversible memory deficits (Zhao et al., 2016). Calpain-mediated cleavage of 
tau generates a 17-kDa tau fragment, which is neurotoxic and mediates Aβ-
induced neurodegeneration (Park and Ferreira, 2005). Moreover, the role of 
asparaginyl endopeptidase, a lysosomal cysteine protease, in tau truncation 
has been widely studied. Asparaginyl endopeptidase is primarily found 
in lysosomes and cleaves tau at N255 and N368 residues, with N368 tau 
fragments being found in both AD brains and tauopathy mice models (Zhang 
et al., 2014b). N368 tau fragments impair microtubule assembly and axon 
elongation, while also promoting tau hyperphosphorylation and propagation, 
since tau devoid of the C terminus is prone to aggregation (Zhang et al., 
2014b; Wang et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2020b). An in vivo study demonstrated 
that attenuating asparaginyl endopeptidase activity generates a therapeutic 
effect on tau pathology and cognitive deficits (Zhang et al., 2017); however, 
its potential as a therapeutic drug for AD and other tauopathies is unclear .
Other PTMs of the tau protein
Tau undergoes several other PTMs, such as methylation, O-GlcNAcylation, 
O-linked β-N-acetylglucosaminylation, glycation, glycosylation, nitration, 
and isomerization. The presence of mono- or di-methylated tau protein has 
been observed in the normal human brain. However, only mono-methylated 
tau protein was identified in immunopurified PHF samples from AD brains 
(Kontaxi et al., 2017). Studies have shown that methylation facilitates 
interaction between tau proteins, thus suppressing tau aggregation and 
increasing microtubule dynamics (Funk et al., 2014; Shams et al., 2022). 
Tau undergoes O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification, a 
reversible modification wherein the serine and threonine residues glycosylate 
with O-GlcNAc. Studies have shown a correlation between increased 
O-GlcNAcylation and reduced phosphorylation of tau protein. O-GlcNAc 
moieties are removed from proteins by an enzyme called O-GlcNAcase. 
In vivo  studies have revealed that inhibiting O-GlcNAcase can reduce tau 
protein expression and ameliorate brain atrophy (Selnick et al., 2019; Wang 
et al., 2020e). Furthermore, tau protein has been shown to undergo N- and 
O-glycosylation. For instance, tau has been shown to undergo N-glycosylation 
in AD brains in humans, which facilitates hyperphosphorylation of tau and 
stabilizes PHF (Losev et al., 2021). Conversely, O-glycosylation occupies the 
Ser or Thr residue of Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro motifs and thus protects against 
tau phosphorylation and tau accumulation. During O-glycosylation, the 
enzyme O-GlcNAc transferases can add an N-acetylglucosamine to the 
Ser or Thr residue, which is believed to block tau phosphorylation. In 
Caenorhabditis elegans models expressing human tau, reduced O-linked 
β-N-acetylglucosaminylation levels linked with impaired glucose metabolism 
promotes tau hyperphosphorylation (Ahmad, 2018; Ahmad et al., 2020). 
Additionally, a correlation was observed between high O-glycosylation and 
reduced phosphorylation of tau in AD (Liu et al., 2004, 2009). A study has 
identified four nitration sites, including Tyr18, Tyr29, Tyr197, and Tyr394, 
in tau proteins, of which, tau nitration at Tyr29, Tyr18, and Tyr394 was 
observed in AD brains, while nitration at Tyr197 was observed in normal 
human brains (Reynolds et al., 2006). The nitration of tau at these sites 
alters tau-microtubule binding affinity, thereby facilitating tau aggregation 
(Reynolds et al., 2005). In addition, Tau undergoes another type of PTM called 
isomerization, which facilitates the rearrangement of proline residues. Pin1, 
a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, specifically isomerizes phosphorylated-
Thr-Pro bonds and thus leads to cis to trans tau conformation (Wang et al., 
2020a). Studies have shown the existence of cis tau in patients with AD and 
brain injury, which drives tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration, 
whereas trans tau is more accessible to dephosphorylation (Lu et al., 1999; 
Kondo et al., 2015; Naserkhaki et al., 2019). 
Tau propagation
The distribution of pathological tau in the brain of patients with AD is highly 
predictable and follows spatiotemporal patterns. First, tau accumulates in the 
entorhinal cortex region, followed by accumulation in the hippocampus, and 
eventually spreads throughout the neocortex (Peng et al., 2020). Mounting 
evidence has shown that structural and functional defects in hippocampal 
plasticity contribute to learning and memory deficits in patients with AD. 
However, it is still unclear if tau dysfunction in the hippocampus occurs 
independently or is a secondary consequence of anatomical propagation 
of tau from the entorhinal cortex region. Various studies have shown that a 
donor cell secretes pathological tau seeds that are absorbed by a recipient 
cell. This could induce the propagation and misfolding of normal endogenous 
tau (Peng et al., 2020). Various factors, such as mutations, PTMs, tau clearance 
mediated by glial cells, neuronal activity, genes (e.g., APOE4, TREM2, and 
BIN1), aging, and interactions between tau and other pathological proteins 
affect tau propagation (Asai et al., 2015; Wegmann et al., 2019; Wang et al., 
2020d; Polanco et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021). Studies have shown that low-
density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 and presynaptic scaffolding  1492  ｜NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH｜Vol 19｜No. 7｜July 2024

protein Bassoon interact with tau seed, which exacerbates the transmission 
and toxicity of tau (Rauch et al., 2020; Martinez et al., 2022). Microglia are 
also implicated in tau propagation, but their role remains controversial. A 
study has shown that the depletion of microglia prevents entorhinal cortex-
to-hippocampus propagation of tau protein (Asai et al., 2015). Furthermore, 
triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) knockout and 
microglial ablation significantly increase the seeding and propagation of tau 
around Aβ plaques. However, activating the disease-associated microglia 
phenotype reduces Aβ-associated pathological tau seeding and propagation 
(Gratuze et al., 2021). Differences in these results may be due to the dual role 
of microglia activation in amyloid pathologies. Despite extensive progress 
in enhancing our understanding of tau propagation, additional studies are 
required to unravel the mechanism underlying pathological formation and 
the molecular nature of tau seeds. This would aid in designing tau-targeted 
therapeutic strategies. 
Tau Toxicity in Alzheimer’s Disease
Abnormal PTMs impair the affinity of tau-microtubule binding, thus increasing 
free tau protein in the cytoplasm. Accumulated free tau protein promotes the 
formation of tau aggregates, which causes mitochondrial damage, impairs 
synaptic plasticity, and glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation ( Figure 3). The 
implications and mechanism of tau toxicity in these pathological conditions 
are critically involved in eliciting/aggravating neurodegeneration and cognitive 
deficits in AD (Wang et al., 2020c; Gratuze et al., 2021). 
accepted as the cellular basis of learning and memory. The molecular 
mechanisms behind impairments in synaptic plasticity induced by tau can 
be classified into two categories. First, synaptic abnormalities are induced by 
direct mislocalization of tau. Studies have shown localization of neurotoxic tau 
in the dendrites, dendritic spines, neuronal membranes, and nuclear speckle, 
which obstructs the formation of new synapses and impairs the stability of 
preexisting synapses (Hoover et al., 2010; Ittner et al., 2010; Merezhko et al., 
2018; Lester et al., 2021; Prikas et al., 2022). Recently, with the development 
of new biochemical technologies, such as the engineered ascorbic acid 
peroxidase approach with quantitative affinity purification mass spectrometry, 
high-throughput proteomics, ultra-high magnification microscopic imaging, 
and proximity ligation assays, tau interactome at subcellular and amino acid 
levels in human neurons have been conducted. These tau interactomes 
have revealed interactions between tau and presynaptic vesicle proteins 
during activity-dependent tau secretion, as well as the tau-binding sites to 
the cytosolic domains of integral synaptic vesicle proteins (Largo-Barrientos 
et al., 2021; Tracy et al., 2022). These advancements provide authentic 
illustrations of the properties of synaptic tau mislocalization. Second, tau 
overexpression may suppress the transcription of synapse-regulating genes 
by altering multiple synapsis-associated transcriptional factors. Ours and 
others’ studies have shown the involvement of mammalian signal transducer 
and activator of transcription (STAT) in regulating tau-induced defects in 
synaptic plasticity (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021). A different study 
found that tau accumulation in cells activates JAK2-dependent STAT1 in 
animal models and patients with AD. While STAT1 directly binds to the GAS 
element of GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B promoters to suppress N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptors expression (Li et al., 2019), STAT3 positively regulates 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor transcription. Additionally, studies have shown 
STAT3 inactivation in tau-accumulating neurons in AD and frontotemporal 
dementia (Hong et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2021). Mechanically, tau directly 
acetylates STAT1, enhancing its binding to STAT3 in the cytoplasm, thus 
sequestering and inhibiting the translocation of STAT3 from the cytoplasm to 
the nucleus and eventually reducing STAT3 transcription (Wan et al., 2021), 
Finally, tau activates STAT1 and inhibits STAT3 to reduce the transcription 
and expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor proteins (Li et al., 2019; 
Wan et al., 2021). The involvement of transcription factor CREB in regulating 
learning and memory has been widely studied. When Ser133 residue of the 
kinase-inducible domain of CREB is phosphorylated by PKA, ERK, and Ca 2+/
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, CBP , a transcriptional coactivator, 
is then recruited to CREB to activate it (Briand et al., 2015). Overexpression 
of human wild-type, full-length tau significantly dephosphorylates CREB 
at Ser133 residue by activating phosphatase calcineurin and suppressing 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV expression (Yin et al., 
2016). Moreover, tau inhibits PKA activity by increasing nuclear proteasome-
dependent PKA regulatory subunit 2α levels, thereby dephosphorylating CREB 
(Ye et al., 2020). Histone acetylation, an epigenetic mechanism, has received 
widespread attention in AD. Inhibition of histone 3, acetylated at K19 and K14, 
and histone 4, acetylated at K5 and K12, by increasing the expression of acidic 
nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member A, which is a key component of 
inhibitor of acetyltransferases, leads to synapse-related proteins decrease 
(Chai et al., 2017, 2018).
Gliosis and neuroinflammation
Reactive gliosis and neuroinflammation are closely associated with tau 
accumulation and neuronal degeneration in AD and other tauopathies. The 
prolonged activation of glial cells, primarily astrocytes and microglia, induces 
the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and 
reactive oxygen species. This creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment 
in glial cells and neurons. Recently, conditional genetic manipulation and 
genome-wide association studies have identified multiple immune-related 
genes (TREM2, CD33, ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA) 7, CX3CR1, 
CR1, and BIN1) as risk factors for tau pathology and AD, thereby supporting 
a critical involvement of glial cells and neuroinflammation in tauopathies 
(Zhong et al., 2017; Pimenova et al., 2018; Brunello et al., 2020; Wang et al., 
2020b, 2022; Griciuc and Tanzi, 2021; Haass, 2021; Jin et al., 2021; Lee et al., 
2021; Wang and Ye, 2021; Zhao et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022; Jain et al., 2023; 
Ochoa et al., 2023; Udeochu et al., 2023).
In the early stage of tau pathology, intracellular accumulation of tau protein 
causes neuronal oxidative stress, which results in the production and release 
of cytokines, inflammatory chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, thus 
provoking adjacent glial cell responses and mild inflammation. Furthermore, 
persistent excessive accumulation of pathological tau promotes neuronal 
death and production of cell debris, leading to intense glial cell activation 
and neuroinflammation. Additionally, pathological tau can be released into 
the extracellular space in free form or encapsulated by extracellular vesicles 
or exosomes (Brunello et al., 2020). Extracellular tau can enter glial cells 
through phagocytosis or receptor mediated endocytosis, thereby activating 
various inflammatory pathways in glial cells. For example, a recent study 
demonstrated that pathological tau protein in microglia can activate the inner 
immune pathway cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interaction genes, 
thus promoting nuclear translation of nuclear factor κB and inflammatory 
gene transcription (Jin et al., 2021). The type I interaction signal is also a 
downstream of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator in the interaction genes 
pathway, which responds to tau accumulation and mediates tau-dependent 
microglial inflammation (Udeochu et al., 2023). In primary astrocytes, 
recombinant filamentous human tau can enter the cell by directly binding to 
integrin αV/β1 receptor, resulting in nuclear factor κB activation, neurotoxic 
astrocyte-like cell phenotype, and the release of inflammatory factors (Wang

Mitochondrial damage
Mitochondria provide energy via oxidative phosphorylation to support 
neuronal activity and maintain the normal functioning of neurons (McElroy 
et al., 2023; Trigo et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023). A study has shown 
that neurotoxic tau protein could disrupt the structural and functional 
integrity of mitochondria, including impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, 
abnormal mitochondrial fusion, fission, trafficking, and distribution, 
impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, and damaged mitophagy (Wang et 
al., 2020c). Mounting evidence has demonstrated that tau accumulation 
promotes abnormal mitochondrial elongation and alters the expression of 
mitochondrial fission proteins, such as a decrease in dynamin-like protein 1 
(DLP1) expression level (DuBoff et al., 2012) or an increase in optic atrophy 1 
and mitofusin (Mfn) expression level (DuBoff et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016). One 
study revealed that DLP1 abnormally interacts with hyperphosphorylated tau 
in AD neurons (Manczak and Reddy, 2012), which may partly explain low DLP1 
expression in mitochondria. Studies have also shown a significant decrease 
in the expression level of all large dynamin-related GTPases, such as DLP1, 
optic atrophy 1, Mfn1, and Mfn2, in the AD brain (Wang et al., 2009; Manczak 
and Reddy, 2012). Different tau isoforms exert varied disrupting effects on 
mitochondrial distribution. A recent study demonstrated that overexpression 
of 1N3R-tau in astrocytes of the dentate gyrus can significantly decrease 
mitochondrial distribution in distal processes, whereas the 1N4R isoform 
of tau promotes mitochondria redistribution toward the soma (Richetin et 
al., 2020). Interestingly, our unpublished data have shown that P301S tau 
induces mitochondrial fission, whereas full-length human tau, 2N4R, induces 
mitochondrial fusion (Li et al., 2016).
In addition, accumulated tau impairs mitophagy by disrupting the parkin-
dependent degradation of damaged mitochondria. Overexpression of 
wildtype and mutant tau in primary hippocampal neurons or neuroblastoma 
cells reduces translocation of parkin in the mitochondria due to abnormal 
interactions between parkin and tau projection domain, thus sequestering it 
in the cytosol (Hu et al., 2016; Cummins et al., 2019). Activation of mitophagy 
by supplementing NAD +, urolithin A, melatonin, and actinonin can attenuate 
the hyperphosphorylation of AD-associated tau in human neuronal cells and 
reverse memory deficits in vivo (Fang et al., 2019).
Impairment of synaptic plasticity

and Ye, 2021). Moreover, pathogenic tau can drive neuroinflammation 
through elevated double-stranded RNA in astrocytes (Ochoa et al., 2023).
In the brain, microglia are the resident innate immune cells that play a 
central role in tau-related neuroinflammation. In patients with AD and tau 
transgenic mice, reactive microglia hierarchically associate with pathological 
tau. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 expressed on the 
surface of microglia is a risk factor in the preclinical stages of AD. In the 
cerebrospinal fluid, a positive correlation was observed between TREM2 and 
total tau, as well as phosphorylated tau (Zhong et al., 2017). Studies have 
shown that loss-of-function mutation (especially R47H) or deletion of TREM2 
could increase the accumulation and spreading of tau protein and brain 
atrophy in amyloid pathology (Haass, 2021; Lee et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2022). 
While a recent study reported that chronic TREM2 activation exacerbates 
the seeding and spreading of Aβ-related tau (Jain et al., 2023), several earlier 
studies have presented the beneficial effects of TREM2 agonist antibodies 
in private amyloid pathology (Wang et al., 2020b; Zhao et al., 2022). A 
possible explanation may be that the activation of TREM2 downstream 
signaling, such as nuclear factor κB signaling, could exacerbate tau spread 
and toxicity in an Aβ-independent manner (Wang et al., 2022). Other AD risk 
factors are enriched by or are uniquely expressed in microglia, such as ATP-
binding cassette transporter family, complement, CD33, HLA-family, MEF2C, 
and MS4A family, have been identified by genome-wide association studies 
(Pimenova et al., 2018; Griciuc and Tanzi, 2021).
Astrocytes, the most abundant type of cells in the brain, are critically involved 
in regulating neuronal homeostasis and neuroinflammation. It is believed 
that neurotoxic reactive astrocytes (also named A1 astrocytes), which highly 
upregulate many classical complemental cascade genes (C1q, C3a, C3b, C3d), 
exhibit impaired phagocytosis and promote neuronal death. By contrast, A2 
astrocytes are neuroprotective with high expression levels of neurotrophic 
factors (Liddelow et al., 2017). Reactive astrocytes surrounding NFTs and Aβ 
plaques are neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Manipulating the expression 
of several astrocyte-related genes, such as complement C3, interleukin-3, 
chitinase-3-like protein 1, alpha 2-Na +/K+ adenosine triphosphatase, and 
histone acetylase 7, exert beneficial effects on reprograming microglia and 
limiting neuroinflammation (Litvinchuk et al., 2018; Lananna et al., 2020; 
McAlpine et al., 2021; Mann et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2022). Additionally, genetic 
tau overexpression or treatment of recombinant tau fibrils drives astrocyte 
reactivity and neuroinflammation (Wang and Ye, 2021; Ezerskiy et al., 2022). 
Moreover, the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein may serve as a 
candidate blood-based biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients 
with AD (Chatterjee et al., 2022).
Plasma Tau in Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis 
Aβ (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N), denoted as A/T/N, are the 
three major classes of biomarkers included in the classification system for 
unbiased AD diagnosis. Positron emission tomography scans for tau/Aβ 
and magnetic resonance imaging for brain atrophy can provide accurate 
diagnostic evidence. However, positron emission tomography is invasive, 
expensive, and limited in its availability, presenting a challenge for AD 
diagnosis. Blood-based biomarkers are a less invasive and potentially cost-
effective option for the diagnosis and classification of AD pathology. Plasma 
phospho-tau is a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prediction of AD 
progression, as well as Aβ pathology. Currently, three tau epitopes, (p-tau181, 
p-tau217, and p-tau231) have been identified as plasma biomarkers for 
predicting AD progression, early diagnosis, and differentiation from non-AD 
neurodegenerative diseases (Mielke et al., 2018; Palmqvist et al., 2020; Milà-
Alomà et al., 2022). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that p-tau181 
and p-tau217 exhibit initial increases in aggregate Aβ as early as two decades 
prior to the development of aggregated tau pathology (Barthélemy et al., 
2020).
Tau-Based Therapeutic Strategies
In the past decades, the primary therapeutic strategies for AD have been 
focused on the Aβ cascade hypothesis; however, therapeutic outcomes have 
been unsatisfactory in clinical trials. Studies have demonstrated that tau 
mediates Aβ-induced toxicity and correlates better with clinical cognitive 
impairments than Aβ burden (Rapoport et al., 2002; Vossel et al., 2010; Brier 
et al., 2016). Thus, targeting tau could be an effective strategy, compared 
to Aβ clearance, in patients with prominent clinical symptoms of AD. With 
the progress in our understanding of tau-dependent neurotoxicity and the 
promising effects of tau immunotherapies in several preclinical studies 
(Congdon and Sigurdsson, 2018), tau-based therapeutic strategies could shed 
new light on AD drug development. Tau-based therapies can be classified into 
the following several groups.
Targeting PTMs of tau 
PTMs, like phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, of tau regulate 
the accumulation and mislocalization of tau. Therefore, modifying the 
enzymatic activity involved in these processes could be a promising 
strategy to mitigate AD pathology. GSK-3β is the most widely explored tau 
phosphorylation-targeted kinase. Treatment of double transgenic [tau and 
Aβ precursor protein (APP)] AD mice with tideglusib, an irreversible GSK-
3β inhibitor, reduces the phosphorylation of tau protein, the burden of 
Aβ plaque, neuronal death, and memory deficits (Serenó et al., 2009). A 
phase II clinical trial showed that tideglusib was safe, but had no significant 
clinical benefits (Lovestone et al., 2015). Salsalate is a nonsteroidal, anti-
inflammatory, small-molecule drug that inhibits the acetylation of tau at 
Lys174 residue. In PS19 mice, the inhibition of p300 histone acetyltransferase 
with salsalate reduces acetylation of tau at Lys174 residue, preserves 
hippocampal volume, and improves memory (Min et al., 2010). These results 
indicate that modulating tau acetylation could be an effective strategy for 
treating tau pathology. In addition, a phase Ib clinical trial (NCT0327573) of 
salsalate is currently underway to determine if salsalate is safe and tolerable 
by patients with prodromal to mild AD. Inhibiting O-GlcNAcase is a novel 
therapeutic approach to block tau pathology in AD. MK-8719 is a small 
molecule selective inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase in humans (Selnick et al., 2019). 
In animal models, MK-8719 significantly reduces pathological tau associated 
with brain atrophy (Wang et al., 2020e). In 2016, the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approved MK-8719 as an orphan drug for treating 
progressive supranuclear palsy.
Promoting tau clearance
The autophagy-lysosome pathway and ubiquitin-proteasomal system are the 
primary methods for clearing misfolded or abnormally aggregated proteins. 
In the brains of AD patients and tauopathy mice models, impaired autophagic 
flux and failed fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes have been seen in 
dystrophic neurites and cell bodies, as evidenced by enhanced accumulation 
of autophagic vacuoles (Nixon et al., 2005; Sanchez-Varo et al., 2012; Piras 
et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2020). Our results showed that accumulated tau 
repressed autophagosome-lysosome fusion through downregulation of IST1, 
which is a factor associated with the endosomal sorting complex required for 
transport-III (ESCRT-III); ESCRT-III is a positive modulator for the formation of 
the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, which is required for 
autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and overexpression of IST1 ameliorates 
autophagy deficits, resulting in attenuated tau accumulation and improved 
cognition (Feng et al., 2020). Transcription factor EB is a master regulator 
of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Transcription factor EB activators, 
including curcumin analog C1, celastrol, and Qingyangshen, enhance the 
degradation of tau aggregates and improve synaptic plasticity as well as 
cognitive functions in several AD mice models (Song et al., 2020; Iyaswamy 
et al., 2021). Similar to the autophagy-lysosome pathway, alterations in the 
ubiquitin-proteasomal system are associated with tau degradation. One study 
observed an association between insoluble tau accumulation and decreased 
peptidase activity of 26S proteasomes in the brain (Myeku et al., 2016). A 
recent study suggests that C004019, a novel small-molecule PROteolysis 
Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) designed to simultaneously recruit tau and E3-
ligase, and thus selectively enhance ubiquitination and proteolysis of tau 
proteins, can selectively and efficiently promote tau clearance (Wang et al., 
2021). PROTAC is an emerging strategy for targeting undruggable proteins 
with several advantages, such as easy design, low cost, high selectivity, and 
specificity; hence, it has attracted widespread attention in the clearance 
of tau and other misfolded proteins. Several tau-targeting small PROTAC 
molecules have shown high selectivity for clearing tau and improved cognitive 
functions in multiple AD models (Jangampalli Adi and Reddy, 2021; Zheng et 
al., 2021). However, the effects of tau-targeting PROTACs for clinical AD or 
other neurodegenerative diseases are yet to be determined. 
Tau immunotherapies
Active and passive Aβ immunotherapies exhibit benefits in APP transgenic 
models. Recently, two monoclonal antibodies were approved by the FDA. In 
2021, the FDA approved aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody developed 
for Aβ clearance and treating patients with mild cognitive impairment 
due to AD. Aducanumab demonstrated promising efficacy in clearing Aβ 
(Karlawish and Grill, 2021); however, data on its effect on slowing or halting 
disease progression in AD are not sufficient. Furthermore, amyloid-related 
imaging abnormalities and edema were observed in a few patients (Karlawish 
and Grill, 2021). Recently, the FDA also approved lecanemab, another Aβ 
monoclonal antibody. Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody 
with high Aβ soluble protofibril binding affinity, and has been shown to slow 
cognitive decline in patients with mild and early AD (van Dyck et al., 2023). 
In an 18-month phase 3 trial, although adverse effects like brain edema and 
intracerebral hemorrhage were observed in approximately 13% of patients 
receiving lecanemab, patients treated with lecanemab showed markedly 
reduced brain amyloid levels and less cognitive decline (Teng et al., 2022). 
These successes offer critical guidance for the design of tau immunotherapies. 
Tau is an intrinsically unfolded protein and mainly accumulates in cells; 
therefore, identifying an appropriate epitope for the immunization of 
pathological tau is undoubtedly more challenging.
Recently, a phase II randomized clinical trial demonstrated that semorinemab, 
a monoclonal antibody, was well-tolerated, accepted, and safe among patients 
with prodromal to mild AD. However, it could not slow the clinical progression 
of AD. Semorinemab targets 6–23 residues in the N-terminal domain of tau 
(Teng et al., 2022), but this epitope may be not present in pathological tau 
primarily responsible for tau spread in prodromal to mild AD (Teng et al., 
2022). AADvac1 is an active peptide vaccine created based on the epitopes 
of the DC8E8 antibody, spanning six amino acids (HXPGGG) of tau MBDs. In a 
phase I clinical trial, 30 patients with mild-to-moderate AD were treated with 
AADvac1, of which 29 developed an IgG response. In addition, no patients 
developed meningoencephalitis or vasogenic edema after administration 
(Novak et al., 2017). In a phase II clinical trial, AADvac1 was well tolerated by 
patients for over a 104-week study period. AADvac1 reduced cerebrospinal 
fluid p-tau-217, p-tau181, total tau, and plasma neurofilament light chain 
levels. Although AADvac1 did not show any significant benefit in patients, 
post hoc analyses suggest that AADvac1 treatment could slow cognitive and   1494  ｜NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH｜Vol 19｜No. 7｜July 2024

 Review
functional decline in patients with AD having both amyloid and tau pathology 
(Novak et al., 2021). A larger phase IIb trial of AADvac1 is planned to recruit 
400 participants with biomarker evidence of Aβ and tau pathology. Several 
monoclonal antibodies against p-tau [Ser202 (Walls et al., 2014), pThr231 
(Sankaranarayanan et al., 2015; Alipour et al., 2022), pSer396/404 (Asuni et 
al., 2007; Liu et al., 2016), p-Ser413 (Umeda et al., 2015), p-Ser422 (Collin et 
al., 2014; van Ameijde et al., 2018)), oligomeric tau (Castillo-Carranza et al., 
2014; Bittar et al., 2022), fragmented tau (Dam et al., 2021), N-terminal tau 
(Dai et al., 2018), and total tau (Höglinger et al., 2021)] have been shown to 
be effective in tau transgenic models. Some of these antibodies (Dam et al., 
2021; Höglinger et al., 2021) are currently in clinical trials. 
The fact that pathological tau aggregates primarily intracellularly may raise 
concerns about application prospects of tau immunotherapies. However, 
several studies have confirmed that tau antibodies can enter cells and 
bind to pathological tau (Peng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022). Tau antibodies 
can enter neurons through crystallizable fragment (Fc) receptor mediated 
endocytosis and bulk endocytosis. For example, 4E6G7, a monoclonal 
tau antibody, which recognizes the Ser396/404 region [cTDHGAEIVYK(pS)
PVVSGDT(pS)PRHL], can enter neurons via clathrin-dependent Fcγ receptor 
endocytosis (Congdon et al., 2013). Moreover, the tau-antibody complex in 
the cytoplasm can recruit the tripartite motif protein 21, a newly identified 
cytosolic Fc receptor, thereby promoting the neutralization of the complex 
through proteasomal degradation (McEwan et al., 2017). Mounting evidence 
has shown that tau can be released into the extracellular space and plays a 
critical role in tau propagation, both in tauopathy animal models and human 
brains. Tau antibodies can effectively recognize these extracellular tau 
species and slow the spread of tau pathology. In animal models expressing 
tau by a prion protein virus promoter, or injected with exogenous tau, tau 
antibodies can effectively block the spread of tau pathology to anatomically 
connected regions (Albert et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022; Song et al., 2023). Of 
note, tau antibodies can block neuronal internalization of AD tau species by 
masking neuron surface proteoglycans (Weisová et al., 2019). Hence, tau 
immunotherapies could delay or block tau pathology through multiple paths 
(Weisová et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022). In conclusion, although the mechanisms 
of tau immunotherapy remain unclear, it is a rapidly developing avenue of 
research, with several clinical trials likely to start soon.
Conclusions and Future Perspectives
To the best of our knowledge, tau is significantly involved in the pathogenesis 
of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Intensive research has 
revealed the critical involvement of tau hyperphosphorylation, acetylation, 
ubiquitination, truncation, propagation, tau-mediated mitochondrial damage, 
synaptic deficits, and neuroinflammation in an effort to better understand the 
processes behind AD pathogenesis. However, additional studies are required 
to determine the underlying mechanisms and the significance of these 
changes in patients with AD. Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation 
and acetylation of tau alter its interactomes, and that these interactions 
between tau and synaptic/mitochondrial processes are associated with 
neurodegeneration (Choi et al., 2020; Drummond et al., 2020; Tracy et al., 
2022). Phosphorylated tau also serves as a significant cerebrospinal fluid 
marker in AD diagnosis and prediction, which is correlated with the onset 
of clinical symptoms long after the appearance of Aβ pathology. Therefore, 
timely detection and elimination of neurotoxic tau at an early stage or before 
the onset of AD could be an effective strategy to maintain neuronal network 
activity and stop or delay AD progression. Recently, the development of 
PROTAC technology, which exhibits high specificity and designability, could 
aid in clearing pathological tau. Moreover, clinical trials on anti-tau vaccines 
and other passive/active immunotherapies are ongoing and have shown 
tremendous potential for treating AD in the future.
This review is subject to several limitations. First, the literature referenced 
in this review is sourced from only the PubMed database, meaning that 
incomplete retrieval of identified research was likely. Second, this incomplete 
retrieval of completed research studies, as well as reporting bias, may have 
inadvertently affected the rationality of the study.

L-Editors: Yu J, Song LP; T-Editor: Jia Y ","The articles discuss various aspects of tau protein and its role in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Research highlights include mechanisms of tau accumulation, phosphorylation, and cleavage, as well as therapeutic strategies targeting tau to improve cognitive functions. Studies explore the involvement of signaling pathways such as GSK-3β, PP2A, STAT1-BACE1, and delta-secretase in tau pathologies. Additionally, antibodies targeting TREM2 and microtubule-binding domains are investigated for their potential therapeutic benefits. The articles also examine the impact of tau on inflammation, synaptic function, and energy metabolism. Overall, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of tau-related neurodegeneration and may inform future treatment approaches.","Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease affecting older adults. Primary features of Alzheimer’s disease include extracellular aggregation of amyloid-β plaques and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, formed by tau protein, in the cells. While there are amyloid-β-targeting therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, these therapies are costly and exhibit potential negative side effects. Mounting evidence suggests significant involvement of tau protein in Alzheimer’s disease-related neurodegeneration. As an important microtubule-associated protein, tau plays an important role in maintaining the stability of neuronal microtubules and promoting axonal growth. In fact, clinical studies have shown that abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein occurs before accumulation of amyloid-β in the brain. Various therapeutic strategies targeting tau protein have begun to emerge, and are considered possible methods to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s disease. Specifically, abnormalities in post-translational modifications of the tau protein, including aberrant phosphorylation, ubiquitination, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation, acetylation, and truncation, contribute to its microtubule dissociation, misfolding, and subcellular missorting. This causes mitochondrial damage, synaptic impairments, gliosis, and neuroinflammation, eventually leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits. This review summarizes the recent findings on the underlying mechanisms of tau protein in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease and discusses tau-targeted treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.","Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, maintains microtubule stability in neurons and promotes axonal growth. Under physiological conditions, hypophosphorylated tau is localized in the axons of neurons. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) made of accumulated tau protein and senile plaques made of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) are the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Wang and Liu, 2008). Significant advancement in understanding the role of tau toxicity in the pathogenesis of AD has been made in the past few decades. Studies have shown that post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation, and truncation of tau protein participate in its stability, misfolding, accumulation, and degradation (Wang and Liu, 2008). Accumulation of tau protein in cells leads to cognitive deficits, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, the impairment of synaptic plasticity, gliosis, and neuroinflammation via multiple pathways (Wang and Liu, 2008). In this review, we summarize the role of tau protein in these processes. Moreover, we provide an overview of tau toxicity in synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning in AD. Finally, we discuss the application potential of tau protein as a therapeutic target for ameliorating AD-related cognitive deficits and other related tauopathies.","Abnormal PTMs impair the affinity of tau-microtubule binding, thus increasing free tau protein in the cytoplasm. Accumulated free tau protein promotes the formation of tau aggregates, which causes mitochondrial damage, impairs synaptic plasticity, and glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation ( Figure 3). The implications and mechanism of tau toxicity in these pathological conditions are critically involved in eliciting/aggravating neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits in AD (Wang et al., 2020c; Gratuze et al., 2021).

Alteration in the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission based on preexisting synaptic activity is called synaptic plasticity and is extensively accepted as the cellular basis of learning and memory. The molecular mechanisms behind impairments in synaptic plasticity induced by tau can be classified into two categories. First, synaptic abnormalities are induced by direct mislocalization of tau. Studies have shown localization of neurotoxic tau in the dendrites, dendritic spines, neuronal membranes, and nuclear speckle, which obstructs the formation of new synapses and impairs the stability of preexisting synapses (Hoover et al., 2010; Ittner et al., 2010; Merezhko et al., 2018; Lester et al., 2021; Prikas et al., 2022). Recently, with the development of new biochemical technologies, such as the engineered ascorbic acid peroxidase approach with quantitative affinity purification mass spectrometry, high-throughput proteomics, ultra-high magnification microscopic imaging, and proximity ligation assays, tau interactome at subcellular and amino acid levels in human neurons have been conducted. These tau interactomes have revealed interactions between tau and presynaptic vesicle proteins during activity-dependent tau secretion, as well as the tau-binding sites to the cytosolic domains of integral synaptic vesicle proteins (Largo-Barrientos et al., 2021; Tracy et al., 2022). These advancements provide authentic illustrations of the properties of synaptic tau mislocalization. Second, tau overexpression may suppress the transcription of synapse-regulating genes by altering multiple synapsis-associated transcriptional factors. Ours and others’ studies have shown the involvement of mammalian signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) in regulating tau-induced defects in synaptic plasticity (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021). A different study found that tau accumulation in cells activates JAK2-dependent STAT1 in animal models and patients with AD. While STAT1 directly binds to the GAS element of GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B promoters to suppress N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors expression (Li et al., 2019), STAT3 positively regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor transcription. Additionally, studies have shown STAT3 inactivation in tau-accumulating neurons in AD and frontotemporal dementia (Hong et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2021). Mechanically, tau directly acetylates STAT1, enhancing its binding to STAT3 in the cytoplasm, thus sequestering and inhibiting the translocation of STAT3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and eventually reducing STAT3 transcription (Wan et al., 2021), Finally, tau activates STAT1 and inhibits STAT3 to reduce the transcription and expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor proteins (Li et al., 2019; Wan et al., 2021). The involvement of transcription factor CREB in regulating learning and memory has been widely studied. When Ser133 residue of the kinase-inducible domain of CREB is phosphorylated by PKA, ERK, and Ca 2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, CBP , a transcriptional coactivator, is then recruited to CREB to activate it (Briand et al., 2015). Overexpression of human wild-type, full-length tau significantly dephosphorylates CREB at Ser133 residue by activating phosphatase calcineurin and suppressing calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV expression (Yin et al., 2016). Moreover, tau inhibits PKA activity by increasing nuclear proteasome-dependent PKA regulatory subunit 2α levels, thereby dephosphorylating CREB (Ye et al., 2020). Histone acetylation, an epigenetic mechanism, has received widespread attention in AD. Inhibition of histone 3, acetylated at K19 and K14, and histone 4, acetylated at K5 and K12, by increasing the expression of acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member A, which is a key component of inhibitor of acetyltransferases, leads to synapse-related proteins decrease (Chai et al., 2017, 2018).

Reactive gliosis and neuroinflammation are closely associated with tau accumulation and neuronal degeneration in AD and other tauopathies. The prolonged activation of glial cells, primarily astrocytes and microglia, induces the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species. This creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment in glial cells and neurons. Recently, conditional genetic manipulation and genome-wide association studies have identified multiple immune-related genes (TREM2, CD33, ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA) 7, CX3CR1, CR1, and BIN1) as risk factors for tau pathology and AD, thereby supporting a critical involvement of glial cells and neuroinflammation in tauopathies (Zhong et al., 2017; Pimenova et al., 2018; Brunello et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b, 2022; Griciuc and Tanzi, 2021; Haass, 2021; Jin et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2021; Wang and Ye, 2021; Zhao et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022; Jain et al., 2023; Ochoa et al., 2023; Udeochu et al., 2023).
In the early stage of tau pathology, intracellular accumulation of tau protein causes neuronal oxidative stress, which results in the production and release of cytokines, inflammatory chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, thus provoking adjacent glial cell responses and mild inflammation. Furthermore, persistent excessive accumulation of pathological tau promotes neuronal death and production of cell debris, leading to intense glial cell activation and neuroinflammation. Additionally, pathological tau can be released into the extracellular space in free form or encapsulated by extracellular vesicles or exosomes (Brunello et al., 2020). Extracellular tau can enter glial cells through phagocytosis or receptor mediated endocytosis, thereby activating various inflammatory pathways in glial cells. For example, a recent study demonstrated that pathological tau protein in microglia can activate the inner immune pathway cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interaction genes, thus promoting nuclear translation of nuclear factor κB and inflammatory gene transcription (Jin et al., 2021). The type I interaction signal is also a downstream of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator in the interaction genes pathway, which responds to tau accumulation and mediates tau-dependent microglial inflammation (Udeochu et al., 2023). In primary astrocytes, recombinant filamentous human tau can enter the cell by directly binding to integrin αV/β1 receptor, resulting in nuclear factor κB activation, neurotoxic astrocyte-like cell phenotype, and the release of inflammatory factors (Wang and Ye, 2021). Moreover, pathogenic tau can drive neuroinflammation through elevated double-stranded RNA in astrocytes (Ochoa et al., 2023).
In the brain, microglia are the resident innate immune cells that play a central role in tau-related neuroinflammation. In patients with AD and tau transgenic mice, reactive microglia hierarchically associate with pathological tau. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 expressed on the surface of microglia is a risk factor in the preclinical stages of AD. In the cerebrospinal fluid, a positive correlation was observed between TREM2 and total tau, as well as phosphorylated tau (Zhong et al., 2017). Studies have shown that loss-of-function mutation (especially R47H) or deletion of TREM2 could increase the accumulation and spreading of tau protein and brain atrophy in amyloid pathology (Haass, 2021; Lee et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2022). While a recent study reported that chronic TREM2 activation exacerbates the seeding and spreading of Aβ-related tau (Jain et al., 2023), several earlier studies have presented the beneficial effects of TREM2 agonist antibodies in private amyloid pathology (Wang et al., 2020b; Zhao et al., 2022). A possible explanation may be that the activation of TREM2 downstream signaling, such as nuclear factor κB signaling, could exacerbate tau spread and toxicity in an Aβ-independent manner (Wang et al., 2022). Other AD risk factors are enriched by or are uniquely expressed in microglia, such as ATP-binding cassette transporter family, complement, CD33, HLA-family, MEF2C, and MS4A family, have been identified by genome-wide association studies (Pimenova et al., 2018; Griciuc and Tanzi, 2021).
Astrocytes, the most abundant type of cells in the brain, are critically involved in regulating neuronal homeostasis and neuroinflammation. It is believed that neurotoxic reactive astrocytes (also named A1 astrocytes), which highly upregulate many classical complemental cascade genes (C1q, C3a, C3b, C3d), exhibit impaired phagocytosis and promote neuronal death. By contrast, A2 astrocytes are neuroprotective with high expression levels of neurotrophic factors (Liddelow et al., 2017). Reactive astrocytes surrounding NFTs and Aβ plaques are neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Manipulating the expression of several astrocyte-related genes, such as complement C3, interleukin-3, chitinase-3-like protein 1, alpha 2-Na +/K+ adenosine triphosphatase, and histone acetylase 7, exert beneficial effects on reprograming microglia and limiting neuroinflammation (Litvinchuk et al., 2018; Lananna et al., 2020; McAlpine et al., 2021; Mann et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2022). Additionally, genetic tau overexpression or treatment of recombinant tau fibrils drives astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation (Wang and Ye, 2021; Ezerskiy et al., 2022). Moreover, the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein may serve as a candidate blood-based biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with AD (Chatterjee et al., 2022).

Mitochondria provide energy via oxidative phosphorylation to support neuronal activity and maintain the normal functioning of neurons (McElroy et al., 2023; Trigo et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023). A study has shown that neurotoxic tau protein could disrupt the structural and functional integrity of mitochondria, including impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, abnormal mitochondrial fusion, fission, trafficking, and distribution, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, and damaged mitophagy (Wang et al., 2020c). Mounting evidence has demonstrated that tau accumulation promotes abnormal mitochondrial elongation and alters the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins, such as a decrease in dynamin-like protein 1 (DLP1) expression level (DuBoff et al., 2012) or an increase in optic atrophy 1 and mitofusin (Mfn) expression level (DuBoff et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016). One study revealed that DLP1 abnormally interacts with hyperphosphorylated tau in AD neurons (Manczak and Reddy, 2012), which may partly explain low DLP1 expression in mitochondria. Studies have also shown a significant decrease in the expression level of all large dynamin-related GTPases, such as DLP1, optic atrophy 1, Mfn1, and Mfn2, in the AD brain (Wang et al., 2009; Manczak and Reddy, 2012). Different tau isoforms exert varied disrupting effects on mitochondrial distribution. A recent study demonstrated that overexpression of 1N3R-tau in astrocytes of the dentate gyrus can significantly decrease mitochondrial distribution in distal processes, whereas the 1N4R isoform of tau promotes mitochondria redistribution toward the soma (Richetin et al., 2020). Interestingly, our unpublished data have shown that P301S tau induces mitochondrial fission, whereas full-length human tau, 2N4R, induces mitochondrial fusion (Li et al., 2016).
In addition, accumulated tau impairs mitophagy by disrupting the parkin-dependent degradation of damaged mitochondria. Overexpression of wildtype and mutant tau in primary hippocampal neurons or neuroblastoma cells reduces translocation of parkin in the mitochondria due to abnormal interactions between parkin and tau projection domain, thus sequestering it in the cytosol (Hu et al., 2016; Cummins et al., 2019). Activation of mitophagy by supplementing NAD +, urolithin A, melatonin, and actinonin can attenuate the hyperphosphorylation of AD-associated tau in human neuronal cells and reverse memory deficits in vivo (Fang et al., 2019)."

Abstract The treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most difﬁcult challenges in neurodegen-
erative diseases due to the insufﬁcient blood ‒brain barrier (BBB) permeability and unsatisfactory intra-brain
distribution of drugs. Therefore, we established an ibuprofen and FK506 encapsulated drug co-delivery system
(Ibu&FK@RNPs), which can target the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and response to
the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD. RAGE is highly and speciﬁcally expressed on the lesion
neurovascular unit of AD, this property helps to improve targeting speciﬁcity of the system and reduce unselec-
tive distribution in normal brain. Meanwhile, these two drugs can be speciﬁcally released in astrocytes of AD
lesion in response to high levels of ROS. As a result, the cognition of AD mice was signiﬁcantly improved and
the quantity of A b plaques was decreased. Neurotoxicity was also alleviated with structural regeneration and
functional recovery of neurons. Besides, the neuroinﬂammation dominated by NF-kB pathway was signiﬁcantly
inhibited with decreased NF-kBa n dI L - 1b in the brain. Overall, Ibu&FK@RNPs can efﬁciently and succes-
sively target diseased BBB and astrocytes in AD lesion. Thus it signiﬁcantly enhances intracephalic accumula-
tion of drugs and efﬁciently treats AD by anti-neuroinﬂammation and neuroprotection.

Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B 2022;12(4):1987 e1999 1. Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the most challengeable neuro-
degenerative diseases, is characterized by progressive cognitive
dysfunction and behavioral impairment occurring in old and pre-
old age 1. However, there were only ﬁve available medicines
before 2021 2, so it is urgent to ﬁnd effective therapeutic targets
and develop efﬁcacious pharmaceutical preparations. The main-
stream direction of AD researches is b amyloid (A b) cascade
hypothesis, but all clinical trials were interrupted due to the lack
of damaged neuronal recovery
2e4. Alternatively, there emerged
other therapeutic targets of AD, including microtubule-associated
protein, anti-neuroinﬂammation, synaptic and neuroprotection,
metabolism, neurogenesis, vascular system and epigenetic drugs,
among which the number of anti-neuroinﬂammatory and neuro-
protective drugs has fastest growing
5. Besides, more and more
researches have shown the comprehensive effects of multiple
pathogenic mechanisms in AD, showing the common feature of
neuroinﬂammatory microenvironment 6.
Neuroinﬂammation, characterized by excessively activated
glial cells and overexpressed inﬂammatory factors in AD, can
interact with neurons and lead to protein deposition and neuronal
dysfunction6e9. The corresponding neuronal responses will
conversely stimulate inﬂammation to form a vicious circle and
aggravate AD 10. Therefore, it would be effective by using anti-
neuroinﬂammatory treatment to undermine the positive feedback
loop of neuroinﬂammation and neuronal dysfunction. Nuclear
factor kappa B (NF- kB) pathway mainly exists in excessively
activated astrocytes of neurodegenerative diseases, and it plays an
important role in anti-neuroinﬂammatory mechanisms
6e9.
Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most widely
used drugs in inhibiting NF- kB signaling pathway 11e17, and high-
dose of ibuprofen have been conﬁrmed to improve dementia-like
symptoms in AD animal models
18e20. Moreover, ibuprofen can
normalize the microenvironment of the lesion to stop disease
deterioration. But it can’t make neuronal damages reversed to cure
AD completely. So it is necessary to use neuroprotective drugs
additionally. Calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, FK506), the most
effective neuroprotective drug in central nervous system diseases,
can maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis to improve
neuronal repair and regeneration
21e26. Moreover, the amelioration
of AD-like behavior has been observed in patients taking
FK506
21,24,26. To sum up, we combined ibuprofen and FK506 for
AD treatment, which could not only inhibit neuroinﬂammation
mediated by NF- kB pathway, but also exert neuroprotective
effects.
For brain targeted drug delivery, the blood ‒brain barrier (BBB),
which is composed by dense endothelial cells and supported by
multiple cells, greatly restricts their internalization and trans-
portation
27e29. To overcome BBB, receptor-mediated transport
(CMT) is the most widely used strategy in nano-targeted delivery
systems27,30. However, traditional CMT-based brain targeting de-
livery leads to unselective distribution in whole brain because of the
homogenous expression of targeted receptors on BBB 31.I ti s
important to ﬁnd targets that are restrictively expressed on BBB of
lesion
32. In AD lesion sites, the receptor of advanced glycation
endproducts (RAGE) is speciﬁcally and highly expressed on the
diseased neurovascular unit, including cerebral vascular endothelial
cells, astrocytes and neurons 33e37. RAP peptide (sequence:
CELKVLMEKEL) is a speciﬁc ligand of RAGE, which could assist
with the transportation of nanoparticles into diseased brain paren-
chyma through CMT38. Furthermore, microenvironment responsive
drug delivery systems could be introduced to achieve rapid and
responsive drug release in the lesion and reduce undemand drug
leakage in healthy areas
39e41. In view of the high level of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) in AD 42,43, ROS-sensitive thioether bond
(MAH-EDT) was introduced into nanoparticles, which would be
broken when exposed in ROS, inducing nanoparticles decomposi-
tion and drug release
44,45. Eventually, the ROS-responsive RAGE-
targeted drug delivery system was established for ibuprofen and
FK506 delivery.
In this study, we developed an ROS-responsive and RAGE-
targeted drug delivery platform (Ibu&FK@RNPs). The ROS-
sensitive sulfur ether linker (MAH-EDT) was used to link poly-
caprolactone (PCL) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with RAP-
modiﬁed at PEG-terminus, and then self-assembled into nano-
particles with ibuprofen and FK506 encapsulated ( Fig. 1 A). With
the assistance of RAP, Ibu&FK@RNPs targeted RAGE on
diseased BBB and was transported into targets cells by CMT.
After reaching the AD lesion and exposed in the high level of
ROS, Ibu&FK@RNPs collapsed and instantaneously released
ibuprofen and FK506 to treat AD ( Fig. 1 B). As a result, the
cognition of AD mice was signiﬁcantly improved and the pro-
duction of A b plaques was inhibited. Neurotoxicity induced by
calcium homeostasis imbalance was also alleviated and the neu-
roinﬂammatory response was signiﬁcantly inhibited. Overall, this
system successively targeted the BBB in AD lesion, astrocytes and
neurons, thus signiﬁcantly enhancing the intracephalic drug
accumulation and treatment efﬁcacy.

2.1.1. Synthesis of ROS-sensitive linker (EDT-MAA)
The ROS-labile sulfur ether cross linker was synthesized ac-
cording to the published methods
45,46. Brieﬂy, 1,2-ethanedithiol
(1.049 mL, 12.5 mmol, 1 eq.) and 1,1-dimethylethyl methacry-
late (2.031 mL, 12.5 mmol, 1 eq.) were added into a 10 mL round
bottom ﬂask. And then triethylamine (15.4 mL, 0.5%, v/v) was
dropped slowly into the mixture. After stirred for 12 h at room
1988 Xueqin He et al. temperature, the product (compound 1) was detected by UV thin-
layer chromatography plates.
2.1.2. Synthesis of polycaprolactone (PCL)
PCL was synthesized according to a previous study 47. At ﬁrst,
calcium hydride (457.8 mg) and ε-caprolactone (15 mL) were

pressure to obtain dry ε-caprolactone. And then, dry ε-capro-
lactone (2.77 mL), benzyl alcohol (129.2 mL) and stannous iso-
octanoate (22.7 mL) were added into a 50 mL round bottom ﬂask.
After stirred for 24 h at 120 /C14 C under the protection of argon, the
products were cooled down to room temperature. At last, the re-
action solid was dissolved into dichloromethane (15 mL) and
precipitated by dropwise adding to methanol. After repeated for 3
times, the precipitated powder was collected and recrystallized for
3 times to yield the PCL.

3500-MAL (32.8 mg, 9.34 nmol, 1.5
eq.) were dissolved into deionized water (3 mL), and triethyl-
amine (15 mL, 0.5%, v/v) was added. After kept stirring for 12 h at
room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into deionized
water (50 mL) and 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was dropped slowly
into the solution to neutralize the triethylamine. Then, the mixture
was wash 3 times by hexane (100 mL) and extracted by
dichloromethane (DCM) for 3 times. The reaction mixture was
ﬁnally evaporated under vacuum to remove the organic solvent

tion product (compound 3) was obtained. Then, PCL (1 mg),
compound 3 (5 mg), DMAP (1 mg) and EDC (5 mg) were dis-
solved into dry DCM (3 mL). After stirred for 12 h at room
temperature, the mixture was evaporated and then dissolved into
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 2 mL) again. The liquid was collected
after dialysis in DMSO and deionized water for 24 h, respectively
using dialysis tube (3500 Da, Sigma eAldrich, USA). After
removed unreacted ingredients, the solution was lyophilized and
the ﬁnal product (compound 4) was obtained.

The RAP peptide (5 mg) and compound 4 (20 mg) were dissolved
into 3 mL acetone, and then triethylamine (15 mL) were added to
maintain the alkaline environment. After continued stirring for
12 h at room temperature, the mixed solvent was evaporated and
then dissolved into DMSO (2 mL) again. The mixture was
collected after dialysis in DMSO and deionized water for 24 h,
respectively using dialysis tube (3500 Da). After unreacted in-
gredients being removed, the solution was lyophilized and the
ﬁnal product was obtained.

600 rpm, the Cou6@NPs was formed. After 4 h of stirring,
organic regents were removed via rotary evaporator and the so-
lution was puriﬁed by Sephadex G-25 (Aladdin, China). The
Cou6@NPs was concentrated after ultraﬁltration at 5000 /C2 g using
Ultra-4 (Amicon, 100kD, Millipore, USA) concentrator tube to
appropriate concentration. Preparation of Cou6@R
nNPs: The
Cou6@RnNPs was prepared as above and the formula as follows

2.1.8. Characterization
The particle size and zeta potential of the complexes were eval-
uated using the dynamic light scattering technique on a Malvern
meter (Malvern, UK). The morphology was observed using a
transmission electron microscope (TEM, H-600, Hitachi, Japan).
The drug-loading capacity and encapsulation efﬁciency of
ibuprofen and FK506 was measured by high performance liquid
chromatography (Agilent LC-20A, Japan), which were referred to
the standard of “ Chinese Pharmacopoeia” (ChP, 2015 edition) and
“Import standard for tacrolimus capsule sustained-release tablets”
(TX20100019), respectively.
2.1.9. Serum stability
The plasma stability of different formulations was evaluated in
PBS with different concentration of fetal bovine serum
(FBS). Ibuprofen@NPs, Ibuprofen@RNPs, FK506@NPs and
FK506@RNPs were suspended in water, PBS with 0%, 10% and
50% FBS and incubated under the condition of 75 rpm, 37
/C14 C. The

2.2. Studies in cells
Quantiﬁed Fluorescence Intensity by Flow Cytometry:
bEnd.3 cells were seeded at the density of 5 /C2 10
4 cells per well in
12-well plates and cultured at 37 /C14 C for 24 h. For the mimetic
environment of AD, 20 mmmol/L of A b oligomers (500 mL) were
added into the well. The Cou6-labled nanoparticles (2.7 mg/mL of
RNPs with 0.6 mg/mL of Coumarin-6) and cells were incubated
together for 2 h at 37
/C14 C. Then cells were washed 3 times with
PBS buffer. The single cell suspension was prepared and quanti-
ﬁed by ﬂow cytometry (BD FACS Celesta, USA).
2.2.1. Preparation of A b oligomers
Ab polymers were dissolved into hexaﬂuoroisopropanol at the
concentration of 5 mg/mL. After dissolved by ultrasound for
30 min, the mixture was incubated at 25
/C14 C for 2 h. The faint
yellow solid, subpackaged and dried with nitrogen, would be
stored at /C0 20 /C14 C for stand-by use. A little aseptic DMSO could be
involved and dissolved by ultrasound for 10 min. Before use, A b
oligomers would be diluted by 10 mM PBS buffer to scheduled
concentration.
2.2.2. Screening the concentration of Ab oligomers for inducing
RAGE expression of cells
After incubated with A b oligomers for 12 h, bEnd.3 and
PC12 cells viability by MTT assays were applied to select the
appropriate concentration.
2.2.3. Cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity was assessed using an MTT assay. Brieﬂy,
bEnd.3 cells were grown on 96-well plates by the concentration of
5 /C2 10
3 cells/well. After 12 h, 20 mmol/L A b oligomers were
dosed for 12 h and then different concentrations of drugs, empty
nanoparticles and drug-loaded nanoparticles were incubated with
the cells for 12 h. Subsequently, the MTT method was used to
determine cell viability. Untreated cells were used as the negative
controls, and the viability was expressed as the percentage of the
absorbance of the negative control.
2.2.4. Qualitative ﬂuorescence intensity by confocal microscopy
The same cell treated procedure was operated as the quantiﬁed
analysis. After incubation, slides adhered cells were ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then stained with 0.5 mg/mL
DAPI for 5 min. Fluorescence intensity was observed with laser
scanning confocal microscopy (Eclipse Ti, Nikon, Japan).
2.3. Studies in animals
The male BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from
Byrness Weil Biotech., Ltd. (Chongqing, China). APP/PS1 mice
were purchased from the Cavens Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd.
(Jiangsu, China). All animals were maintained under SPF grade
feeding conditions and experiments were approved by the Animal
Experimentation Ethics Committee of Sichuan University.
2.3.1. Synthesis of Cy5.5-labled ibuprofen (Cy5.5-Ibu)
Ibuprofen (2 mg), N,N
ʹ-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (2 mg) and
Cy5.5 amine (1 mg) were dissolved in dry DCM (6 mL) and then
pH was adjusted to 8 e9 by using N,N-diisopropylethylamine. The
reaction mixture was then replaced under nitrogen to completely
remove the oxygen. After string for 2 h in ice-water bath, the
reactants were turned to room temperature and continued reacting
for 12 h. The mixture was placed at 4
/C14 C for the fully precipitation
of insoluble components and the supernatant were collected after
centrifugation at 10,000 /C2 g for 10 min. Organic regents were
removed via rotary evaporator and solids were dissolved into
DMSO (2 mL) again. The mixture was collected after dialysis in
DMSO and deionized water for 24 h, respectively using dialysis
tube (500 kDa). After removed unreacted ingredients, the solution
was lyophilized and the ﬁnal product was obtained.
2.3.2. Preparation of Cy5.5-Ibu@NPs
A total of Cy5.5-Ibu (2 mg), FITC-PCL-PEG (97 mg) and PEP
(3 mg) were dissolved in acetone (2 mL) and then mixed with
1990 Xueqin He et al. deionized water (40 mL). With the magnetic stirring of 600 rpm,
the Cy5.5-Ibu@NPs was formed. After 4 h of stirring, organic
regents were removed via rotary evaporator and the solution was
puriﬁed by Sephadex G-25 (Aladdin, China). The Cy5.5-
Ibu@NPs was concentrated after ultraﬁltration at 5000 /C2 g using
Ultra-4 (Amicon, 100 kDa, Millipore, USA) concentrator tube to
appropriate concentration.
2.3.3. Preparation of Cy5.5-Ibu@RNPs
The Cy5.5-Ibu@RNPs was prepared as above, except that PEPR
(3.5 mg) was added into the solution except for PEP.
2.3.4. In vivo imaging
The AD mice were intravenously injected with Cy5.5-Ibu-labeled
nanoparticles (1 mg/kg of Cy5.5-Ibu, equal to 50 mg/kg of RNPs).
After injected for 1, 2, 4 and 6 h, mice were imaged using the
Lumina III Imaging System (PerkinElmer, USA). At 6 h, the mice
were sacriﬁced and their organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney
and brain) were separated and captured as above. All tissues were
totally soaked into 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, dehydrated with
sucrose solution step by step and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T
compound (Sakura Finetek, USA). Then they were sectioned at
10 mm with the freezing microtome (Leica CM1950, Germany).
Brain slides were operated by immunoﬂuorescence of anti-RAGE
antibody and other organs were stained with DAPI. The images of
co-localization were observed using a confocal microscope.
2.3.5. Immunoﬂuorescence
After sacriﬁced and processed of tissues, frozen slices were
washed and blocked. After cultured with primary antibody over-
night at 4
/C14 C, the slices were further stained with FITC-conjugated
secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. After stained
with 0.5 mg/mL of DAPI at room temperature for 5 min, sections
were sealed by anti-fade mounting medium. Images were captured
by a confocal microscope.
2.3.6. Quantitative distribution in AD mice
Ibu&FK@RNPs and Ibu&FK@NPs were intravenously injected
into AD mice at the therapeutic dose, respectively. After 1, 2, 4
and 6 h, brains were collected and stored at /C0 20
/C14 C, and the
plasma were collected immediately (Eppendorf, 5420, Germany)
(1500/C2 g, 10 min) for further study. 100 mL plasmas were mixed
with 10 mL naproxen internal standard solution (25 mg/mL) and
FK520 internal standard solution (2.5 mg/mL) for LC ‒MS/MS.
Brain was divided into hippocampus and normal tissues, and
then 3 folds ( w/v) of saline buffer were added for grinded thor-
oughly. 10 mL naproxen (500 ng/mL) and FK520 (50 ng/mL) were
mixed with 100 mL tissue homogenate separately. After vortexed
for 1 min, 200 mL zinc sulfate solution (0.2 mol/L) was added and
vortex again. When ﬁnished, 400 mL acetonitrile were mixed for
2 min sonication. Then the samples were centrifuged for 10 min
(13,000/C2 g,4 /C14 C). The upper suspension was mixed with 1.5 mL
ethyl acetate roughly and centrifuged for 10 min (13,000 /C2 g,4 /C14 C)
to collect the upper organic layer. After dried by air and resus-
pended by 200 mL acetonitrile, the samples were collected for
LC‒MS/MS.
2.3.7. Morris water maze test
The AD model mice were randomly divided into ﬁve groups
(n Z 5). Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used as healthy control.
After 3 weeks of treatment, spatial sensitivity and learning
memory ability of mice were assessed by the Morris water maze
test. Mice were put in a round pool (100 cm in diameter and 50 cm
in height), which contained a settled circle platform. If the mice
found the platform within 60 s, they would have to stay for 10 s. If
the mice couldn’t ﬁnd it, they would be guided to the platform for
10 s rest. After training for 5 days, the platform was removed and
the spatial probe test was carried out. They were allowed to swim
freely for 60 s. All data from tests were used for statistical anal-
ysis. After the test, all mice were sacriﬁced and the whole blood
and plasma were gathered for complete blood counts (CBC) and
blood biochemical test.
2.3.8. Immunohistochemistry
Ten-month-old double transgenic mice were divided into four
groups on average ( n Z 5). The healthy control group was wild-
type C57BL/6 mice. Medicinal preparation (Ibuprofen&FK506,
Ibu&FK@NPs and Ibu&FK@RNPs) and PBS were administered
intravenously every other day at the dose, including 1 mg/kg of
FK506 and 16.5 mg/kg of ibuprofen. After 21 days, mice were
sacriﬁced and their tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and
brain) were sampled for H&E staining partly. In addition, the
hippocampal slices were stained with toluidine blue solution to
show the density of Nissl’s body. The immunohistochemistry
method was used to observe the concentration of A b plaques after
sections were incubated by anti-A b
1-42 antibody.
2.3.9. Evaluation of systemic toxicity
The mice were weighed once every 2 days during the treatment.
The cumulative toxicity of the nanoparticles was observed by
H&E staining on the visceral slices of mice after treatment.
2.3.10. Statistical analysis
The paired Student’s t-test was used in the comparative analysis of
each group. *P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 and *** P < 0.001 are
considered a statistically signiﬁcant difference, respectively, and
ns means not signiﬁcant.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles
Firstly, the ROS-sensitive polymer (PEP) was obtained according
to the synthetic routes ( Fig. 2 A). Then RAP was decorated in the
PEG-terminals of PEP to form the RAGE-targeted polymer
(PEPR). Intermediate products were characterized by
1H NMR
spectrum ( Supporting Information Fig. S1 ) and MALDI-TOF MS
(Supporting Information Fig. S2 ), respectively. Finally, PCL-
MPEG, PEPR and drugs were mixed proportionally, and then
self-assembled to prepare nanoparticles by the solvent diffusion
method.
According to the bEnd.3 and PC12 cell viabilities by MTT
assay ( Supporting Information Fig. S3 ), cells were pre-incubated
with 20 mmol/L A b oligomers for 12 h to simulate the patho-
logical condition of AD
34,35,37. Based on the bEnd.3 cell uptake
efﬁciencies, Cou6@R 1NPs performed the best, which was 1.42
times higher than Cou6@NPs ( Supporting Information Fig. S4 ).
Therefore, RNPs with 6.7% RAP modiﬁcation was used in the
following experiments. The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta po-
tential of Ibu&FK@RNPs were 86.87 nm and /C0 38.31 mV,
respectively (Supporting Information Table S2 ). The drug-loading
capacity and encapsulation efﬁciency of ibuprofen were 60.48%
and 4.24%, with those of FK506 were 55.56% and 6.79%,
Targeted nano-missiles achieve anti-inﬂammation and neuroprotection in Alzheimer’s disease 1991 respectively. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) demon-
strated spherical morphology of nanoparticles with a uniform
dispersity and the diameter of Ibu&FK@RNPs was about 20 nm
(Fig. 2 B).
3.2. Stability, drug release and cytotoxicity of Ibu&FK@RNPs
An excellent stability of nanoparticles incubated in PBS and
plasma is required to ensure their stable condition before and after
administration
48. After incubated in water or PBS for 48 h, there
were no changes in the hydrodynamic diameters and PDI
(Supporting Information Fig. S5 ). However, after 12 h incubation
with 10% and 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS), their hydrodynamic
diameters increased 30 e60 nm and 50 e60 nm, respectively, along
with stable PDI. The reasons for above results might include the
electrostatic repulsion
49 and formation of nanoparticle corona 50,51.
Therefore, the nanoparticles can be stored in water and PBS buffer
for at least 48 h.
The cumulative release rate of FK506@RNPs in different so-
lutions was measured by dialysis bags method ( Fig. 2 C)52. The
48 h cumulative FK506 release of nanoparticles in 100 mmol/L
H2O2 solution was 45% e60%, while that in PBS was 20% e30%.
The results show FK506 release was ROS-responsive.
According to the results of previous researches, the intravenous
dose of 1 mg/kg of FK506 or 16.5 mg/kg of ibuprofen, equal to
50 mg/L of FK506 and 825 mg/L of ibuprofen in cells, might be
effective to treat AD 24,53. Cytotoxicity by MTT assays was
measured to study the safety of Ibu&FK@RNPs ( Fig. 3 A and B,
and Supporting Information Fig. S6 ). The results showed the cell
viabilities of Ibu&FK@NPs and Ibu&FK@RNPs were about
100% and 97% respectively, indicating the good biosafety at
treatment dose.
3.3. Evaluation of in vitro cellular uptake and BBB transcytosis
The bEnd.3 cell was pre-incubated with A b to simulate diseased
BBB. The 2 h bEnd.3 cell internalization of Cou6-labeled nano-
particles was quantitatively analyzed by ﬂow cytometry and
imaged by confocal imaging ( Fig. 3 C and D). The cellular uptake
of Cou6@RNPs was 1.42 times higher than Cou6@NPs in
diseased bEnd.3 cells, while there was no difference in healthy
cells. This result was consistent with corresponding confocal
images, proving that RAP promoted internalization of nano-
particles speciﬁcally by the diseased cerebral vascular endothelial
cell, but it did not work in normal state. Further, the inhibitor of
RAGE, FPS-ZM1 was used to study the mechanism of RAP tar-
geting ( Supporting Information Fig. S7 ). Pre-incubated with FPS-
ZM1 in diseased PC12 cells, the cellular uptake of Cou6@RNPs
was 1.36 times lower than that without inhibitors, while there was
no difference in the Cou6@RNPs group. The results dedicate that
the enhanced cellular uptake of RAP-modiﬁed nanoparticles was
ascribed to targeting RAGE.
On the other hand, the bEnd.3 monolayer pre-incubated A b
was established to determine transportation of RNPs across the
Figure 2 Synthetic routes and characterization of nanoparticles. (A) Synthetic routes of PEP. Compound 1: EDT-MAA; compound 2: MAL-
PEG-EDT-MAA; compound 3: MAL-PEG-MAL-EDT-MAH; compound 4: PEP. (B) TEM images of nanoparticles. Scale bars represent 100 nm.

1992 Xueqin He et al. diseased BBB. After bEnd.3 cells seeded, the transmembrane
resistance of monolayers was measured by a resistor every day 54.
Until Day 10, transmembrane resistance was stable at about
170 U, and then cells were incubated with 20 mmol/L A b oligo-
mers for 12 h to simulate the diseased BBB. Then different Cou6-
labeled nanoparticles were added into donor chamber of trans-
wells and illustrated their transmembrane efﬁciency in 3D
confocal images ( Fig. 3 E). The longitudinal ( Z-axis) illustrated
that Cou6@RNPs penetrated faster and deeper than control
nanoparticles. The 4 h penetration depth of RNPs is much deeper
than NPs in 12 h, indicating that RNPs had better diseased BBB
transcytosis than controlled nanoparticles. This ﬁnding demon-
strates the superiority of RAP modiﬁcation in the diseased BBB
penetration.
3.4. In vivo distribution of RNPs
To explore the in vivoBBB transcytosis and brain accumulation of
nanoparticles in AD, the Cy5.5-labeled ibuprofen (Cy5.5-Ibu) was
synthesized and demonstrated by
1H NMR spectrum ( Supporting
Information Fig. S8 ). And then the biodistribution of Cy5.5-Ibu-
labeled nanoparticles in AD mice were monitored by living
imaging ( Fig. 4 A). As living images illustrated, the brain ﬂuo-
rescent intensity of mice administrated Cy5.5-Ibu@RNPs was
continuously enhanced and increased to the top between 4 and 6 h,
while there were no obvious changes in NPs group. After being
administrated for 6 h, mice were sacriﬁced and ex vivoimages of
main organs were obtained ( Fig. 4 B and Supporting Information
Fig. S9A ). Although high level of nanoparticles was distributed
in livers, the brain ﬂuorescence intensity of RNPs group was much
stronger than NPs group, which was 1.55 times higher according
to semi-quantiﬁcation ( Fig. 4 C). The results demonstrated that
RAP modiﬁcation endowed faster BBB transportation and more
brain accumulation of nanoparticles in AD mice.
Brains were also sliced to observe the accumulation of nano-
particles and immunoﬂuorescence colocation with RAGE by
confocal imaging ( Fig. 4 D). The brain ﬂuorescence intensity of
Cy5.5-Ibu in RNPs group was much stronger than NPs group, and
the obvious RAGE immunoﬂuorescence images colocation was
observed in RAP-modiﬁed nanoparticles. Moreover, there were no
obvious differences of distribution in peripheral organs between
RNPs and NPs, with similar ﬁndings illustrated in the confocal
images of organs frozen slices ( Supporting Information Fig. S9B
and C ). These results indicate that RAP modiﬁcation could

of nanoparticles by targeted RAGE.
3.5. The in vivo concentration-time curves of FK506 and
ibuprofen
After 1, 2, 4 and 4 h treatment, the concentration of drugs in blood
was gradually decreased ( Fig. 4 E and Supporting Information
Fig. S10 ). In the hippocampus and brain, concentration of
FK506 was gradually raised to the top in 4 h. Besides, RAP
peptide-modiﬁed nanoparticles had higher drug concentration in
brain, indicating the peptide modiﬁcation could improve the brain
and AD targeting delivery capacity. However, the concentration ‒
time curves of ibuprofen showed different trend which could be
explained by its faster metabolism.
3.6. The behavioral test by Morris water maze
Progressive cognitive dysfunction and impaired behavior are
typical clinical symptoms of AD
2, so Morris Water maze test is
often used to assess the behavioral conditions in animal
experiment. During training, the average time spent to reach the
platform of mice administrated PBS, Ibuprofen&FK506 and
Ibu&FK@NPs were ﬂuctuating and irregular ( Fig. 5 A). However,
the above condition did not appear in the Ibu&FK@RNPs group
whose average incubation period to reach the platform was
gradually shortened and similar to healthy mice, which implied
strong learning and memory abilities. After the training was
completed, spatial probe test was experimented with the original
platform removed ( Fig. 5 B and Supporting Information Fig. S11 ).
In the placed navigation test, representative swimming paths of
AD mice showed aimless circles in PBS and Ibuprofen&FK506
groups. In contrast, the swimming paths of Ibu&FK@RNPs group
and healthy mice were purposeful in searching for the platform
and concentrated in the target quadrant. In addition, time spent to
reach the platform was also presented statistically different
(Fig. 5 C). Compared with the mice treated by PBS
(39.6 /C6 18.3 s), Ibuprofen&FK506 (27.2 /C6 12.7 s) and
Ibu&FK@NPs (31.7 /C6 9.1 s), the AD mice administrated with
Ibu&FK@RNPs took the least time (10.2 /C6 5.2 s) to reach the
platform, which was similar to healthy mice (11.9 /C6 4.4 s). The

1994 Xueqin He et al. platform were also counted ( Fig. 5 D). The AD mice treated with
PBS passed through the platform for less than once, while Ibu-
profen&FK506 (2.2 /C6 1.1 times) or Ibu&FK@NPs (2.2 /C6 1.2
times) groups increased, respectively. Besides, compared with
healthy mice (4.0 /C6 1.7 times), the Ibu&FK@RNPs group showed
similar frequency (4.3 /C6 1.2 times). These results suggested the
sense of space in AD mice could be improved by Ibu&FK@RNPs
and reﬂected the RAGE targeted drug depot signiﬁcantly
improved the intracerebral drug delivery and ameliorated learning
acquisition and the sense of space of AD.
3.7. Decrease of the production of b amyloid plaques in vivo
Although all A b targeted medicines were terminated, A b plaques
were still recognized as the characteristic physiological marker of
AD
5. Immunohistochemical staining was used to illustrate the
amount of A b plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice
(Fig. 5 E). We observed many and large plaques, illustrating A b
plaques were overexpressed in the brain of APP/PS1 mice.
Excitingly, the A b plaques burden was signiﬁcantly reduced by
1.64 times after the treatment of Ibu&FK@RNPs and there was no
statistic difference in combination drug treatment ( Fig. 5 F). This
result indicates the combination medication could speciﬁcally
inhibit the production of toxic isoform A b plaques. However, the
modiﬁcation of nanocarriers had few efﬁcacies in reducing A b
plaques.
3.8. Neuroprotective effects
In AD, A b plaques and tau tangles work together to increase
intracellular concentration of Ca
2þ and induce neurotoxicity 22.
Thus, we evaluated the function of neurons by Nissl staining
(Fig. 6 A and B). We chose to evaluate the CA1 area because it
was prone to be damaged in the hippocampus. The marked
neuronal damages, including neuronal hypocellularity, were
observed in the CA1 hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mice
treated with PBS, Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@NPs.
Nevertheless, the above phenomena were not found in healthy

Targeted nano-missiles achieve anti-inﬂammation and neuroprotection in Alzheimer’s disease 1995 mice and Ibu&FK@RNPs groups. Besides, the quantitative
expression of Nissl’s body in the CA1 area showed that the
quantitative in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 3 times higher than
that of APP/PS1 mice. These results demonstrated that RAP-
modiﬁed formulations attenuated the impairment of neuronal
integrity as well as neuron loss . Additionally, new neurons
could continue to be generated throughout the adulthood of
healthy mammals and the nerve regeneration might be pro-
moted by FK506
21,25. In consequence, the synaptic change of
neuron skeleton protein (MAP2) is usually used to monitor the
neurite outgrowth and provide a subtler indication of neuronal
function55. From the immunoﬂuorescence of MAP2, hippo-
campus of APP/PS1 mice, Ibuprofen&FK506 and
Ibu&FK@RNPs groups showed decreased MAP2 expression,
while healthy mice and the Ibu&FK@RNPs group had more
positive expression of MAP2 ( Fig. 6 C and D). Accordingly,
Ibu&FK@RNPs could not only effectively protect the neurons,
but also increase the number of synapses to ameliorate the
memory decline.
3.9. Anti-neuroinﬂammatory effects
The active neuroinﬂammatory responses in the AD brain were
manifested by excessive activation of glial cells and over-
expression of inﬂammatory factors
47. The immunoﬂuorescence
images of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed dendroid
chunks spreading among the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice and
Ibuprofen&FK506 groups, illustrating the over-activated astro-
cytes of AD ( Fig. 7A and Supporting Information Fig. S12A ). The
inhibited status of astrocytes was demonstrated by the small strip
and spotty ﬂuorescence signals of GFAP which was showed in
Ibu&FK@RNPs group and healthy mice. The quantiﬁcation of
GFAP in the cerebral cortex of mice showed 12.78 times lower
level than that of APP/PS1 mice. The results proved the excessive
activation of astrocytes was signiﬁcantly inhibited by
Ibu&FK@RNPs.
In AD pathology, the NF- kB pathway of astrocytes plays an
essential role in the vicious circle of neuroinﬂammatory response
and neuronal dysfunction
56. To explore this pathway, we studied
the expression of NF- kB and associated inﬂammatory factors (IL-
1b) in brains. The results of Western blot showed the expression of
NF-kB was signiﬁcantly increased in APP/PS1 mice in compari-
son with control groups ( Fig. 7 B). Besides, after treated with
Ibu&FK@RNPs, the expression of NF- kB was similar to healthy
mice. The relative content of NF- kB in Ibu&FK@RNPs group
was 1.57 times lower than APP/PS1 mice, but showed no statis-
tical signiﬁcance comparing with healthy mice ( Fig. 7 C). In
addition, there were no differences with APP/PS1 mice between
Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@NPs groups. Additionally, we
also measured the level of I kBa in the brain by Western Blot
(Supporting Information Fig. S13 ). The semiquantitative inte-
grated intensity of I kBa in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 1.79 times

1996 Xueqin He et al. lower than that of APP/PS1 mice, dedicating that drugs could
inhibit the upstream signal of NF- kB pathway to anti-
neuroinﬂammation.
IL-1b was an important inﬂammatory factor of NF- kB
pathway, so we also measured its concentration by ELISA assays
(Fig. 7D and Fig. S12B). The results show the concentration of IL-
1b was increased by 6.73 and 1.74 times in serum and brain
separately, indicating the over-expression of IL-1 b in AD. More-
over, the serum and brain concentration of IL-1 b in
Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 4.59 and 1.26 times lower than APP/
PS1 mice, respectively. In serum, there were similar anti-
inﬂammatory effects between Ibu&FK@RNPs and control for-
mulations. Surprisingly, there was evident signiﬁcance in brain
level of IL-1 b between Ibu&FK@RNPs and control formulations,
demonstrating the improvement of anti-neuroinﬂammatory effects
by RAP-modiﬁed nanoparticles.
As supplementary, we performed routine blood tests on the
mice ( Supporting Information Fig. S14 ). Typical inﬂammatory
indicators, including the number of WBC, LY and PMN, were
elevated in APP/PS1 mice, indicating peripheral inﬂammation of
AD. Furthermore, this condition was dampened by medicine, in
accordance with the peripheral expression of IL-1 b. These ﬁnd-
ings demonstrate that Ibu&FK@RNPs can inhibit NF- kB pathway
for anti-neuroinﬂammation, and thus it can treat AD efﬁciently.
3.10. Evaluation of systemic toxicity
In vivotoxicity of the nanoparticles was evaluated by body weight
changes, organs’ H&E staining and related biochemical
indicators. Firstly, APP/PS1 mice were administrated different
formulations and their body weights were recorded every 2 days.
The results show that there was no obvious difference among all
groups ( Supporting Information Fig. S15 ). After 21 days of
treatment, mice were sacriﬁced and their blood samples were
prepared. Blood biochemical indexes showed that ALT, AST and
BUN were all within the normal range ( Supporting Information
Table S2 ). Besides, the H&E staining of organs proved there
were no visible pathological changes in each groups ( Supporting
Information Fig. S16 ). Therefore, the RAGE-targeting drug de-
livery depot possessed excellent safety.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we designed an ROS-sensitive and RAGE targeted drug
delivery depot (Ibu&FK@RNPs), which could progressively target
diseased BBB and brain parenchymal cells to improve the treatment
of ibuprofen and FK506 against AD. At ﬁrst, cellular uptake efﬁ-
ciency validated that RAP could speciﬁcally recognize the RAGE on
diseased BBB and improve the internalization of nanoparticles by
CMT. Besides, the in vitro cumulative release of FK506@RNPs
incubated in 100 mmol/L H
2O2 solutions proved the ROS-responsive
drug release of nanoparticles. Secondly, in vitro diseased BBB
transcytosis and in vivoﬂuorescence imaging investigation demon-
strated that RAP-modiﬁed nanoparticles could pass through BBB
and target the lesion site more quickly and effectively. Finally, the
results of Morris water maze test and immunohistochemistry dis-
played that Ibu&FK@RNPs inhibited the production of A b and
improved the dementia symptoms. As a result, Ibu&FK@RNPs

roinﬂammation in AD mice. Furthermore, this ROS-sensitive and
RAGE targeted drug delivery system could be adopted to enhance the
therapeutic efﬁcacy for other brain diseases.

Targeted nano-missiles achieve anti-inﬂammation and neuroprotection in Alzheimer’s disease 1999 ","The article discusses targeted nano-missiles for treating Alzheimer's disease with a focus on achieving anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. It highlights several key aspects:

1. Nanoparticles targeting blood-brain barrier (BBB) to deliver therapeutic agents directly into the brain.
2. Use of RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) and LRP-1 (Low-density Lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein 1) as targets due to their involvement in amyloid-beta toxicity.
3. Smart nanotheranostic agents that respond to tumor microenvironment changes, such as pH or ROS levels, enhancing cancer therapy.
4. Nanoparticles designed for early modulation of activated microglia to treat Alzheimer's by remodeling the disease microenvironment.
5. Mitochondria-targeting ceria nanoparticles used as antioxidants in Alzheimer’s treatment.
6. The impact of protein corona on nanoparticle behavior and targeting ability.

The article also mentions specific studies involving nanocarriers for gene delivery, inflammation inhibition, and targeted vaccination through nasal administration. It emphasizes the importance of designing smart nanomaterials that can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier and modulate inflammatory responses in Alzheimer's disease.","The treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most difficult challenges in neurodegenerative diseases due to the insufficient blood ‒brain barrier (BBB) permeability and unsatisfactory intra-brain distribution of drugs. Therefore, we established an ibuprofen and FK506 encapsulated drug co-delivery system (Ibu&FK@RNPs), which can target the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and response to the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD. RAGE is highly and specifically expressed on the lesion neurovascular unit of AD, this property helps to improve targeting specificity of the system and reduce unselective distribution in normal brain. Meanwhile, these two drugs can be specifically released in astrocytes of AD lesion in response to high levels of ROS. As a result, the cognition of AD mice was significantly improved and the quantity of A b plaques was decreased. Neurotoxicity was also alleviated with structural regeneration and functional recovery of neurons. Besides, the neuroinflammation dominated by NF-kB pathway was significantly inhibited with decreased NF-kBa n dI L - 1b in the brain. Overall, Ibu&FK@RNPs can efficiently and successively target diseased BBB and astrocytes in AD lesion. Thus it significantly enhances intracephalic accumulation of drugs and efficiently treats AD by anti-neuroinflammation and neuroprotection.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the most challengeable neuro-degenerative diseases, is characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment occurring in old and pre-old age 1. However, there were only five available medicines before 2021 2, so it is urgent to find effective therapeutic targets and develop efficacious pharmaceutical preparations. The mainstream direction of AD researches is b amyloid (A b) cascade hypothesis, but all clinical trials were interrupted due to the lack of damaged neuronal recovery 2e4. Alternatively, there emerged other therapeutic targets of AD, including microtubule-associated protein, anti-neuroinflammation, synaptic and neuroprotection, metabolism, neurogenesis, vascular system and epigenetic drugs, among which the number of anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective drugs has fastest growing 5. Besides, more and more researches have shown the comprehensive effects of multiple pathogenic mechanisms in AD, showing the common feature of neuroinflammatory microenvironment 6. Neuroinflammation, characterized by excessively activated glial cells and overexpressed inflammatory factors in AD, can interact with neurons and lead to protein deposition and neuronal dysfunction6e9. The corresponding neuronal responses will conversely stimulate inflammation to form a vicious circle and aggravate AD 10. Therefore, it would be effective by using anti-neuroinflammatory treatment to undermine the positive feedback loop of neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF- kB) pathway mainly exists in excessively activated astrocytes of neurodegenerative diseases, and it plays an important role in anti-neuroinflammatory mechanisms 6e9. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most widely used drugs in inhibiting NF- kB signaling pathway 11e17, and high-dose of ibuprofen have been confirmed to improve dementia-like symptoms in AD animal models 18e20. Moreover, ibuprofen can normalize the microenvironment of the lesion to stop disease deterioration. But it can’t make neuronal damages reversed to cure AD completely. So it is necessary to use neuroprotective drugs additionally. Calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, FK506), the most effective neuroprotective drug in central nervous system diseases, can maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis to improve neuronal repair and regeneration 21e26. Moreover, the amelioration of AD-like behavior has been observed in patients taking FK506 21,24,26. To sum up, we combined ibuprofen and FK506 for AD treatment, which could not only inhibit neuroinflammation mediated by NF-kB pathway, but also exert neuroprotective effects. For brain targeted drug delivery, the blood ‒brain barrier (BBB), which is composed by dense endothelial cells and supported by multiple cells, greatly restricts their internalization and transportation 27e29. To overcome BBB, receptor-mediated transport (CMT) is the most widely used strategy in nano-targeted delivery systems27,30. However, traditional CMT-based brain targeting delivery leads to unselective distribution in whole brain because of the homogenous expression of targeted receptors on BBB 31.I ti s important to find targets that are restrictively expressed on BBB of lesion 32. In AD lesion sites, the receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is specifically and highly expressed on the diseased neurovascular unit, including cerebral vascular endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons 33e37. RAP peptide (sequence: CELKVLMEKEL) is a specific ligand of RAGE, which could assist with the transportation of nanoparticles into diseased brain parenchyma through CMT38. Furthermore, microenvironment responsive drug delivery systems could be introduced to achieve rapid and responsive drug release in the lesion and reduce undemand drug leakage in healthy areas 39e41. In view of the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD 42,43, ROS-sensitive thioether bond (MAH-EDT) was introduced into nanoparticles, which would be broken when exposed in ROS, inducing nanoparticles decomposition and drug release 44,45. Eventually, the ROS-responsive RAGE-targeted drug delivery system was established for ibuprofen and FK506 delivery. In this study, we developed an ROS-responsive and RAGE-targeted drug delivery platform (Ibu&FK@RNPs). The ROS-sensitive sulfur ether linker (MAH-EDT) was used to link polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with RAP-modified at PEG-terminus, and then self-assembled into nanoparticles with ibuprofen and FK506 encapsulated ( Fig. 1 A). With the assistance of RAP, Ibu&FK@RNPs targeted RAGE on diseased BBB and was transported into targets cells by CMT. After reaching the AD lesion and exposed in the high level of ROS, Ibu&FK@RNPs collapsed and instantaneously released ibuprofen and FK506 to treat AD ( Fig. 1 B). As a result, the cognition of AD mice was significantly improved and the production of A b plaques was inhibited. Neurotoxicity induced by calcium homeostasis imbalance was also alleviated and the neuroinflammatory response was significantly inhibited. Overall, this system successively targeted the BBB in AD lesion, astrocytes and neurons, thus significantly enhancing the intracephalic drug accumulation and treatment efficacy.","Firstly, the ROS-sensitive polymer (PEP) was obtained according to the synthetic routes ( Fig. 2 A). Then RAP was decorated in the PEG-terminals of PEP to form the RAGE-targeted polymer (PEPR). Intermediate products were characterized by 1H NMR spectrum ( Supporting Information Fig. S1 ) and MALDI-TOF MS (Supporting Information Fig. S2 ), respectively. Finally, PCL-MPEG, PEPR and drugs were mixed proportionally, and then self-assembled to prepare nanoparticles by the solvent diffusion method. According to the bEnd.3 and PC12 cell viabilities by MTT assay ( Supporting Information Fig. S3 ), cells were pre-incubated with 20 mmol/L A b oligomers for 12 h to simulate the pathological condition of AD 34,35,37. Based on the bEnd.3 cell uptake efficiencies, Cou6@R 1NPs performed the best, which was 1.42 times higher than Cou6@NPs ( Supporting Information Fig. S4 ). Therefore, RNPs with 6.7% RAP modification was used in the following experiments. The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of Ibu&FK@RNPs were 86.87 nm and /C0 38.31 mV, respectively (Supporting Information Table S2 ). The drug-loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency of ibuprofen were 60.48% and 4.24%, with those of FK506 were 55.56% and 6.79%, respectively. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) demonstrated spherical morphology of nanoparticles with a uniform dispersity and the diameter of Ibu&FK@RNPs was about 20 nm (Fig. 2 B). An excellent stability of nanoparticles incubated in PBS and plasma is required to ensure their stable condition before and after administration 48. After incubated in water or PBS for 48 h, there were no changes in the hydrodynamic diameters and PDI (Supporting Information Fig. S5 ). However, after 12 h incubation with 10% and 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS), their hydrodynamic diameters increased 30 e60 nm and 50 e60 nm, respectively, along with stable PDI. The reasons for above results might include the electrostatic repulsion 49 and formation of nanoparticle corona 50,51. Therefore, the nanoparticles can be stored in water and PBS buffer for at least 48 h. The cumulative release rate of FK506@RNPs in different solutions was measured by dialysis bags method ( Fig. 2 C)52. The 48 h cumulative FK506 release of nanoparticles in 100 mmol/L H2O2 solution was 45% e60%, while that in PBS was 20% e30%. The results show FK506 release was ROS-responsive. According to the results of previous researches, the intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg of FK506 or 16.5 mg/kg of ibuprofen, equal to 50 mg/L of FK506 and 825 mg/L of ibuprofen in cells, might be effective to treat AD 24,53. Cytotoxicity by MTT assays was measured to study the safety of Ibu&FK@RNPs ( Fig. 3 A and B, and Supporting Information Fig. S6 ). The results showed the cell viabilities of Ibu&FK@NPs and Ibu&FK@RNPs were about 100% and 97% respectively, indicating the good biosafety at treatment dose. The bEnd.3 cell was pre-incubated with A b to simulate diseased BBB. The 2 h bEnd.3 cell internalization of Cou6-labeled nanoparticles was quantitatively analyzed by flow cytometry and imaged by confocal imaging ( Fig. 3 C and D). The cellular uptake of Cou6@RNPs was 1.42 times higher than Cou6@NPs in diseased bEnd.3 cells, while there was no difference in healthy cells. This result was consistent with corresponding confocal images, proving that RAP promoted internalization of nanoparticles specifically by the diseased cerebral vascular endothelial cell, but it did not work in normal state. Further, the inhibitor of RAGE, FPS-ZM1 was used to study the mechanism of RAP targeting ( Supporting Information Fig. S7 ). Pre-incubated with FPS-ZM1 in diseased PC12 cells, the cellular uptake of Cou6@RNPs was 1.36 times lower than that without inhibitors, while there was no difference in the Cou6@RNPs group. The results dedicate that the enhanced cellular uptake of RAP-modified nanoparticles was ascribed to targeting RAGE. On the other hand, the bEnd.3 monolayer pre-incubated A b was established to determine transportation of RNPs across the diseased BBB. After bEnd.3 cells seeded, the transmembrane resistance of monolayers was measured by a resistor every day 54. Until Day 10, transmembrane resistance was stable at about 170 U, and then cells were incubated with 20 mmol/L A b oligomers for 12 h to simulate the diseased BBB. Then different Cou6-labeled nanoparticles were added into donor chamber of transwells and illustrated their transmembrane efficiency in 3D confocal images ( Fig. 3 E). The longitudinal ( Z-axis) illustrated that Cou6@RNPs penetrated faster and deeper than control nanoparticles. The 4 h penetration depth of RNPs is much deeper than NPs in 12 h, indicating that RNPs had better diseased BBB transcytosis than controlled nanoparticles. This finding demonstrates the superiority of RAP modification in the diseased BBB penetration. To explore the in vivoBBB transcytosis and brain accumulation of nanoparticles in AD, the Cy5.5-labeled ibuprofen (Cy5.5-Ibu) was synthesized and demonstrated by 1H NMR spectrum ( Supporting Information Fig. S8 ). And then the biodistribution of Cy5.5-Ibu-labeled nanoparticles in AD mice were monitored by living imaging ( Fig. 4 A). As living images illustrated, the brain fluorescent intensity of mice administrated Cy5.5-Ibu@RNPs was continuously enhanced and increased to the top between 4 and 6 h, while there were no obvious changes in NPs group. After being administrated for 6 h, mice were sacrificed and ex vivoimages of main organs were obtained ( Fig. 4 B and Supporting Information Fig. S9A ). Although high level of nanoparticles was distributed in livers, the brain fluorescence intensity of RNPs group was much stronger than NPs group, which was 1.55 times higher according to semi-quantification ( Fig. 4 C). The results demonstrated that RAP modification endowed faster BBB transportation and more brain accumulation of nanoparticles in AD mice. Brains were also sliced to observe the accumulation of nanoparticles and immuno-fluorescence colocation with RAGE by confocal imaging ( Fig. 4 D). The brain fluorescence intensity of Cy5.5-Ibu in RNPs group was much stronger than NPs group, and the obvious RAGE immuno-fluorescence images colocation was observed in RAP-modified nanoparticles. Moreover, there were no obvious differences of distribution in peripheral organs between RNPs and NPs, with similar findings illustrated in the confocal images of organs frozen slices ( Supporting Information Fig. S9B and C ). These results indicate that RAP modification could improve the BBB transportation and facilitate brain accumulation of nanoparticles by targeted RAGE. After 1, 2, 4 and 4 h treatment, the concentration of drugs in blood was gradually decreased ( Fig. 4 E and Supporting Information Fig. S10 ). In the hippocampus and brain, concentration of FK506 was gradually raised to the top in 4 h. Besides, RAP peptide-modified nanoparticles had higher drug concentration in brain, indicating the peptide modification could improve the brain and AD targeting delivery capacity. However, the concentration ‒time curves of ibuprofen showed different trend which could be explained by its faster metabolism. Progressive cognitive dysfunction and impaired behavior are typical clinical symptoms of AD 2, so Morris Water maze test is often used to assess the behavioral conditions in animal experiment. During training, the average time spent to reach the platform of mice administrated PBS, Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@NPs were fluctuating and irregular ( Fig. 5 A). However, the above condition did not appear in the Ibu&FK@RNPs group whose average incubation period to reach the platform was gradually shortened and similar to healthy mice, which implied strong learning and memory abilities. After the training was completed, spatial probe test was experimented with the original platform removed ( Fig. 5 B and Supporting Information Fig. S11 ). In the placed navigation test, representative swimming paths of AD mice showed aimless circles in PBS and Ibuprofen&FK506 groups. In contrast, the swimming paths of Ibu&FK@RNPs group and healthy mice were purposeful in searching for the platform and concentrated in the target quadrant. In addition, time spent to reach the platform was also presented statistically different (Fig. 5 C). Compared with the mice treated by PBS (39.6 /C6 18.3 s), Ibuprofen&FK506 (27.2 /C6 12.7 s) and Ibu&FK@NPs (31.7 /C6 9.1 s), the AD mice administrated with Ibu&FK@RNPs took the least time (10.2 /C6 5.2 s) to reach the platform, which was similar to healthy mice (11.9 /C6 4.4 s). The frequencies of mice passing through the location of original platform were also counted ( Fig. 5 D). The AD mice treated with PBS passed through the platform for less than once, while Ibuprofen&FK506 (2.2 /C6 1.1 times) or Ibu&FK@NPs (2.2 /C6 1.2 times) groups increased, respectively. Besides, compared with healthy mice (4.0 /C6 1.7 times), the Ibu&FK@RNPs group showed similar frequency (4.3 /C6 1.2 times). These results suggested the sense of space in AD mice could be improved by Ibu&FK@RNPs and reflected the RAGE targeted drug depot significantly improved the intracerebral drug delivery and ameliorated learning acquisition and the sense of space of AD. Although all A b targeted medicines were terminated, A b plaques were still recognized as the characteristic physiological marker of AD 5. Immunohistochemical staining was used to illustrate the amount of A b plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 5 E). We observed many and large plaques, illustrating A b plaques were overexpressed in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Excitingly, the A b plaques burden was significantly reduced by 1.64 times after the treatment of Ibu&FK@RNPs and there was no statistic difference in combination drug treatment ( Fig. 5 F). This result indicates the combination medication could specifically inhibit the production of toxic isoform A b plaques. However, the modification of nanocarriers had few efficacies in reducing A b plaques. In AD, A b plaques and tau tangles work together to increase intracellular concentration of Ca 2þ and induce neurotoxicity 22. Thus, we evaluated the function of neurons by Nissl staining (Fig. 6 A and B). We chose to evaluate the CA1 area because it was prone to be damaged in the hippocampus. The marked neuronal damages, including neuronal hypocellularity, were observed in the CA1 hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mice treated with PBS, Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@NPs. Nevertheless, the above phenomena were not found in healthy mice and Ibu&FK@RNPs groups. Besides, the quantitative expression of Nissl’s body in the CA1 area showed that the quantitative in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 3 times higher than that of APP/PS1 mice. These results demonstrated that RAP-modified formulations attenuated the impairment of neuronal integrity as well as neuron loss . Additionally, new neurons could continue to be generated throughout the adulthood of healthy mammals and the nerve regeneration might be promoted by FK506 21,25. In consequence, the synaptic change of neuron skeleton protein (MAP2) is usually used to monitor the neurite outgrowth and provide a subtler indication of neuronal function55. From the immuno-fluorescence of MAP2, hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@RNPs groups showed decreased MAP2 expression, while healthy mice and the Ibu&FK@RNPs group had more positive expression of MAP2 ( Fig. 6 C and D). Accordingly, Ibu&FK@RNPs could not only effectively protect the neurons, but also increase the number of synapses to ameliorate the memory decline. The active neuroinflammatory responses in the AD brain were manifested by excessive activation of glial cells and over-expression of inflammatory factors 47. The immuno-fluorescence images of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed dendroid chunks spreading among the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice and Ibuprofen&FK506 groups, illustrating the over-activated astrocytes of AD ( Fig. 7A and Supporting Information Fig. S12A ). The inhibited status of astrocytes was demonstrated by the small strip and spotty fluorescence signals of GFAP which was showed in Ibu&FK@RNPs group and healthy mice. The quantification of GFAP in the cerebral cortex of mice showed 12.78 times lower level than that of APP/PS1 mice. The results proved the excessive activation of astrocytes was significantly inhibited by Ibu&FK@RNPs. In AD pathology, the NF-kB pathway of astrocytes plays an essential role in the vicious circle of neuroinflammatory response and neuronal dysfunction 56. To explore this pathway, we studied the expression of NF-kB and associated inflammatory factors (IL-1b) in brains. The results of Western blot showed the expression of NF-kB was significantly increased in APP/PS1 mice in comparison with control groups ( Fig. 7 B). Besides, after treated with Ibu&FK@RNPs, the expression of NF-kB was similar to healthy mice. The relative content of NF-kB in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 1.57 times lower than APP/PS1 mice, but showed no statistical significance comparing with healthy mice ( Fig. 7 C). In addition, there were no differences with APP/PS1 mice between Ibuprofen&FK506 and Ibu&FK@NPs groups. Additionally, we also measured the level of I kBa in the brain by Western Blot (Supporting Information Fig. S13 ). The semiquantitative integrated intensity of I kBa in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 1.79 times lower than that of APP/PS1 mice, dedicating that drugs could inhibit the upstream signal of NF-kB pathway to anti-neuroinflammation. IL-1b was an important inflammatory factor of NF-kB pathway, so we also measured its concentration by ELISA assays (Fig. 7D and Fig. S12B). The results show the concentration of IL-1 b was increased by 6.73 and 1.74 times in serum and brain separately, indicating the over-expression of IL-1 b in AD. Moreover, the serum and brain concentration of IL-1 b in Ibu&FK@RNPs group was 4.59 and 1.26 times lower than APP/PS1 mice, respectively. In serum, there were similar anti-inflammatory effects between Ibu&FK@RNPs and control formulations. Surprisingly, there was evident significance in brain level of IL-1 b between Ibu&FK@RNPs and control formulations, demonstrating the improvement of anti-neuroinflammatory effects by RAP-modified nanoparticles. As supplementary, we performed routine blood tests on the mice ( Supporting Information Fig. S14 ). Typical inflammatory indicators, including the number of WBC, LY and PMN, were elevated in APP/PS1 mice, indicating peripheral inflammation of AD. Furthermore, this condition was dampened by medicine, in accordance with the peripheral expression of IL-1 b. These findings demonstrate that Ibu&FK@RNPs can inhibit NF-kB pathway for anti-neuroinflammation, and thus it can treat AD efficiently. In vivo toxicity of the nanoparticles was evaluated by body weight changes, organs’ H&E staining and related biochemical indicators. Firstly, APP/PS1 mice were administrated different formulations and their body weights were recorded every 2 days. The results show that there was no obvious difference among all groups ( Supporting Information Fig. S15 ). After 21 days of treatment, mice were sacrificed and their blood samples were prepared. Blood biochemical indexes showed that ALT, AST and BUN were all within the normal range ( Supporting Information Table S2 ). Besides, the H&E staining of organs proved there were no visible pathological changes in each groups ( Supporting Information Fig. S16 ). Therefore, the RAGE-targeting drug delivery depot possessed excellent safety."

ABSTRACT  
Ethnopharmacological relevance: Alzheimer ’ s disease is the most common form of dementia, but its treatment 
options remain few and ineffective. To find new therapeutic strategies, natural products have gained interest due 
to their neuroprotective potential, being able to target different pathological hallmarks associated with this 
disorder. Several plant species are traditionally used due to their empirical neuroprotective effects and it is worth 
to explore their mechanism of action. 
Aim of the study: This study intended to explore the neuroprotective potential of seven traditional medicinal 
plants, namely Scutellaria baicalensis , Ginkgo biloba , Hypericum perforatum , Curcuma longa , Lavandula angustifolia , 
Trigonella foenum-graecum and Rosmarinus officinalis . The safety assessment with reference to pesticides residues 
was also aimed.

enzymes related to neurodegeneration (cholinesterases and glycogen synthase kinase-3 β ). Cell viability through 
MTT assay was also evaluated in two different brain cell lines, namely non-tumorigenic D3 human brain 
endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) and NSC-34 motor neurons. Furthermore, and using GC, 21 pesticides residues

It is the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide. The underlying mechanisms of AD are complex and multifactorial, involving the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein leading to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cholinergic deficits. Current therapeutic strategies for AD are limited and primarily focus on symptomatic relief, with no cure available. The development of effective treatments requires a deeper understanding of the disease's pathogenesis and the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) have emerged as a promising strategy for treating complex diseases like AD. MTDLs are designed to interact with multiple biological targets involved in the disease process, offering a more comprehensive and potentially synergistic therapeutic effect compared to single-target drugs. Natural products, particularly those derived from medicinal plants, have a long history of use in traditional medicine and have provided a rich source of bioactive compounds with diverse pharmacological properties. Their complex chemical composition often allows them to interact with multiple targets, making them attractive candidates for developing MTDLs for AD. Ethnopharmacological knowledge, which documents the traditional uses of plants for medicinal purposes, can guide the selection of plant species for scientific investigation. Many plant species have been empirically used for their purported neuroprotective effects, suggesting their potential in managing neurodegenerative disorders. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective potential of seven traditional medicinal plants, namely Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Ginkgo biloba L., Hypericum perforatum L., Curcuma longa L., Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Trigonella foenum-graecum L., and Rosmarinus officinalis L. These plants have been selected based on their traditional use in treating neurological disorders and their known phytochemical profiles. The study will evaluate their ability to scavenge free radicals, inhibit key enzymes implicated in AD pathogenesis (cholinesterases and glycogen synthase kinase-3 β), and assess their safety regarding pesticide residues. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of the plant extracts on relevant neuronal and endothelial cell lines will be evaluated to provide a comprehensive understanding of their neuroprotective potential.","Chromatographic analysis of the seven decoctions revealed a diverse phytochemical profile. Scutellaria baicalensis decoction was rich in flavonoids, particularly baicalein and wogonin. Ginkgo biloba decoction contained significant amounts of ginkgolides and bilobalide, along with flavonoids like quercetin and kaempferol. Hypericum perforatum decoction showed the presence of hypericin, hyperforin, and flavonoids. Curcuma longa decoction was characterized by curcuminoids, including curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Lavandula angustifolia decoction contained phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid, as well as flavonoids. Trigonella foenum-graecum decoction exhibited a complex profile with saponins, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Rosmarinus officinalis decoction was rich in phenolic diterpenoids, including carnosic acid and rosmarinic acid. All seven decoctions demonstrated significant free radical scavenging activity against DPPH•, ABTS•+, O2•‒, and •NO radicals. The scavenging capacity varied among the extracts, with some showing stronger activity than others. For instance, R. officinalis and H. perforatum decoctions exhibited particularly potent antioxidant effects. Regarding enzyme inhibition, all decoctions displayed moderate inhibitory activity against glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK-3 β). The IC50 values for GSK-3 β inhibition ranged from 50 to 200 μg/mL for most extracts. However, the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) was generally weak to moderate. The IC50 values for AChE and BuChE inhibition were mostly above 100 μg/mL, with some exceptions. G. biloba and L. angustifolia decoctions exhibited the lowest cytotoxicity in both hCMEC/D3 and NSC-34 cell lines, with significant cell viability observed even at high concentrations (up to 200 μg/mL). Other extracts showed varying degrees of cytotoxicity, with some requiring lower concentrations to induce a significant reduction in cell viability. Importantly, the GC analysis for 21 different pesticide residues did not detect any of these compounds in any of the seven plant decoctions, indicating a good safety profile in terms of pesticide contamination."

Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that semaglutide, a
glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) and obesity, protects against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.
However, real-world evidence for its ability to protect against Alzheimer’s disease
(AD)islacking.
METHODS: Weconductedemulationtargettrialsbasedonanationwidedatabaseof
electronic health records (EHRs) of 116 million US patients. Seven target trials were
emulatedamong1,094,761eligiblepatientswithT2DMwhohadnopriorADdiagnosis
bycomparingsemaglutidewithsevenotherantidiabeticmedications.First-everdiag-
nosis of AD occurred within a 3-year follow-up period and was examined using Cox
proportionalhazardsandKaplan–Meiersurvivalanalyses.
RESULTS:Semaglutidewasassociatedwithsignificantlyreducedriskforfirst-timeAD

1 BACKGROUND
An estimated 6.9 million Americans aged 65 and older will be living
with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in 2024, a number that is projected to
increase to 13.8 million by 2060.1 AD has no cure, and about 40% of
cases are linked to modifiable risk factors.2 Given its growing preva-
lence, profound societal and economic impact, and absence of a cure,
targetingthesemodifiableriskfactorsiscrucialtopreventordelayAD
andrelateddementia. 3,4
Semaglutide,aglucagon-likepeptide-1receptoragonist(GLP-1RA),
was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2017 and for weight loss in 2021.
BothT2DMandobesityaresignificantmodifiableriskfactorsforAD. 2
Furthermore,semaglutidehasdemonstratedbenefitsinmanagingvar-
ious other health conditions such as cardiovascular factors, alcohol
use, smoking, and depression,5–9 many of which are also linked to AD
risk.2 Givenitsabilitytotargettheseriskfactors,wehypothesizethat

2 METHODS
2.1 Specification of the target trials
2.1.1 Study overview
We compared the new use of semaglutide with the new use of other
antidiabetic medications on first-time diagnoses of AD using a target
trial emulation framework.13,14 We assessed six T2DM patient popu-
lations without prior AD diagnosis: all patients, older patients (≥60),
women,men,patientswithobesity,andpatientswithoutobesity.Table
S1 lists key protocol components. For each population, we specified
seven target trials separately comparing semaglutide with insulins,
metformin,dipeptidyl-peptidase-4inhibitors(DPP-4i),sodium-glucose
cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), sulfonylureas (SUs), thiazolidine-
diones(TZDs),andotherGLP-1RAs(albiglutide,dulaglutide,exenatide,
liraglutide,andlixisenatide).Thetargettrialsarespecifiedasfollows.
2.1.2 Eligibility criteria
Eligibility criteria for all target trials included patients with T2DM
whohadmedicalencountersbetweenDecember2017andMay2021,
had no use of any antidiabetic medications within the past 6 months
(“new user”), and were diagnosed with at least one condition among
semaglutide’sprescriptionguidelines(eg,obesity,hypertension,hyper-
cholesterolemia, heart diseases, stroke, or A1C≥8.5%).15 Exclusions
included a history of AD, co-prescription of semaglutide and compar-
ison medications, and certain medical conditions (pancreatitis, type
1 diabetes, thyroid cancer, gastroparesis) based on contraindications,
warnings, and limited use information for semaglutide.15 Additional
criteriaforsubpopulationswereasfollows:
∙ Olderpatients:age ≥60(agebasedontimeofmedicationprescrip-
tion)
∙ Women/men:gender-basedinclusion
∙ Patientswithobesity:recentmedicalencountersforobesitydiagno-
siswithinpast2years
∙ Patients without obesity: excluded if they had a recent medical
encounterforobesitydiagnosiswithinpast2years(Table S2)
2.1.3 Treatment strategies
In each of the seven target trials, the treatment strategies were the
initiationofsemaglutideuseatbaseline(indexevent)ortheinitiation
of comparison antidiabetic medication use at baseline (index event),
but not both. For all treatment strategies, initiation of use is defined
as the first prescription for the drug, consistent with an intention-to-
treatdesign.Thetreatmentstrategyisassignedatbaseline,regardless
ofmedicationuseadherence,medicationswitch,oradd-on.

prescriptions (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine, adu-
canumab,lecanemab)wereusedasasecondaryoutcome.Twonon-AD-
specifichealthcaremeasureswereusedforsensitivityanalyses:overall
medicalencountersandoutpatientmedicalencounters.Eachoutcome
wasanalyzedseparately(nomultiplecomparisonsnorcompetingout-
comes). Each eligible patient was followed from the index event until
theoccurrenceoftheoutcome,death,losstofollow-up,or3yearsafter
theindexevent,whicheveroccurredfirst.
2.1.5 Analysis approach
Thecausalestimatesofinterestrepresenttheintention-to-treateffect
of being assigned to the treatment strategies. Cumulative incidences
were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis in patients
who were propensity-score matched (1:1 using nearest-neighbor
greedy matching with a caliper of 0.25 times the standard devia-
tion) for baseline covariates. Cox proportional hazards analyses were
used to compare rates of time to events daily during the follow-up
time after the index event. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were
calculated. All models are adjusted for confounders at baseline by
propensity-score-matchingbaselinecovariates.
2.2 Emulation of target trials
We explicitly emulated the target trials described previously using
data and built-in analytic functions on the TriNetX Analytics plat-
form.TriNetXisaglobal,federated,healthresearchnetworkproviding
access to deidentified and aggregated EHRs from approximately 113
million patients in 64 large healthcare organizations covering diverse
geographic regions, age, race and ethnicity, income and insurance
groups, and clinical settings.16 This study analyzed deidentified and
population-based EHR data within the TriNetX Analytics platform.
The built-in analytics within the TriNetX Analytic platform analyzed
patient-leveldata;however,onlypopulation-levelresultsarereported
to users. TriNetX data are HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and
AccountabilityAct)de-identifiedandaccesstoprotectedhealthinfor-
mationisnotallowed.Therefore,thereisnoriskforprotectedhealth
informationdisclosure,andInstitutionalReviewBoardreviewwasnot
required. The TriNetX platform has been successfully used in retro-
spective cohort studies for AD17–19 and to evaluate associations of
semaglutidewithsuicidalideation, 20 cannabisuse,21 alcoholuse,7 and
smoking8 andforassociationsofGLP-1RAswithcancerrisks. 22–24
Available data elements of EHRs include extensive information on
demographics, diagnoses, medications, procedures, laboratory tests,
visits, and socioeconomic and lifestyle information. All covariates are
eitherbinary,categorical,orcontinuousbutessentiallyguaranteedto
exist(moredetailsofTriNetXareinthe SupplementaryMaterial).
Each component of the target trial was emulated using EHRs from
the TriNetX Analytics platform (more details of target trial emula-
tion components are in TablesS1 to S4 and Figure S1). Patients
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
∙ Systematic review: The authors reviewed the litera-
ture using PubMed sources. Emerging evidence suggests
semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist
(GLP-1RA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obe-
sity, may have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory
effects.However,real-worldevidenceonitsroleindelay-
ing or preventing Alzheimer’sdisease (AD) islacking. The
relevantreferencesareappropriatelycited.
∙ Interpretation: Our findings show that semaglutide was
linked to lower risks of first-time AD diagnosis in T2DM
patients compared to other antidiabetic medications,
includingotherGLP-1RAs.Thesefindingssupportfurther
clinical trials to assess semaglutide’s potential in delaying
orpreventingAD.
∙ Future directions: Future research should explore its
effectsinmildcognitiveimpairment,otherdementias,and
neurodegenerative diseases, as well as investigate other
GLP-1RAsliketirzepitideandcombinationtherapieswith
other antidiabetic medications. Additional preclinicaland
clinical studies are necessary to understand the mech-
anisms and establish causal effects through randomized
trials.
wereclassifiedintodrugtreatmentgroups–semaglutideversusother
antidiabetic medications (insulins, metformin, DPP-4i, SGLT2i, SU,
TZDs, and other GLP-1RAs) – based on the first prescription in the
study period (December 2017 to May 2021), which was the baseline
or index event. The study period of December 2017 to May 2021
was chosen because semaglutide was approved as Ozempic to treat
T2DM in December 2017 and before it was approved as Wegovy for
weight loss in June 2023. Eligibility criteria and more than 50 base-
line covariates were evaluated at baseline. The semaglutide group
and each of the seven comparison treatment groups were separately
propensity-score matched for covariates at the baseline to emu-
laterandomization.Afterpropensity-scorematching,thesemaglutide
groupanditscorrespondingcomparisongroupwerebalanced.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Study populations
Figure1isaflowchartofthecohortcomposition.Thestudyincluded
1,094,761 new users of antidiabetic medications, including 17,104
new users of semaglutide and 1,077,657 new users of other antidi-
abetic medications. Semaglutide was separately compared with each
of the seven antidiabetic medication classes in patients with T2DM.
Beforepropensity-scorematching,theinsulinandsemaglutidegroups
differed by age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis of obesity, some cardiovas-
cular conditions, and AD-related risk factors and by overall medical
encounters including outpatient visits. After propensity-score match-
ing,comparisongroupswerebalanced(Table 1).
3.2 Associations of semaglutide and first-time
diagnosis of AD in patients with T2DM
Patients with T2DM who were prescribed semaglutide had a signifi-
cantly decreased risk of receiving a first-time diagnosis of AD during
a3-yearfollow-upcomparedwiththoseprescribedotherantidiabetic
medications, with a HR of 0.33 (0.21 to 0.51) compared with insulins
and 0.59 (0.37 to 0.95) compared with other GLP-1RAs (Figure2A).
Among older adults aged ≥60 years at the index event (average
67.9 ± 5.79), the overall 3-year risk of first-time diagnosis of AD
was twice as high as in the general population (average 58.1± 12.1):
0.33% versus 0.16%. Nonetheless, a similar decrease in first-time
diagnosesofADwasobservedforsemaglutide(Figure S2).

with a HR of 0.22 compared with insulins and a HR of 0.53 compared
with other GLP-1RAs (Figure3A). Similar trends were observed in
men, though the associations were weaker than in women, but with

3.5 Associations of semaglutide and AD-related
medication prescriptions in patients with T2DM
We examined AD-related medication prescriptions (donepezil,
rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine, aducanumab, and lecanemab)
as an alternative outcome in patients with T2DM who had no prior
diagnosis of AD. Semaglutide was associated with a decreased risk of
AD-relatedmedicationprescriptionscomparedwithotherantidiabetic
medications in patients with T2DM, with and without obesity (Figure
S3),consistentwiththemainfindingbasedonafirst-timediagnosisof
AD.
3.6 Sensitivity analysis
As a sensitivity analysis of potential differences in overall health-
careutilization,wecomparedboththeoverallandoutpatientmedical
encounters between the matched groups. The semaglutide group did
not differ substantially from the comparison groups in overall or out-
patient medical encounters, though most of the comparisons were
statistically significant, with a HR from 0.87 to 1.14, during a 3-year
follow-up(Figure S4).
4 DISCUSSION
In our study of real-world populations with T2DM, a high-risk group
for AD, semaglutide showed a lower risk of first-time AD diagno-
sisorAD-relatedmedicationprescriptionscomparedtoinsulin,other
non-insulin/non-GLP-1RAs, and other GLP-1RAs. These results were
similar for older patients, both genders, and those with and with-
out obesity. Cumulative incidence curves began to diverge within 30
days and continued to separate thereafter, indicating semaglutide’s
potentialtodelayorslowADdevelopmentwithsustainedeffects.

Our study findings align with recent evidence suggesting GLP-
1RAs like semaglutide may protect cognitive function.25,26 Preclinical
research indicates semaglutide’s potential in reducing Aβ-mediated
neurotoxicity, enhancing autophagy, improving brain glucose uptake,
and reducing Aβ plaques and tau tangles.27,28 Clinical data, includ-
ing studies with dulaglutide, show GLP-1RAs can reduce cognitive
impairmentinpatientswithT2DM. 29 Datapooledfromthreerandom-
ized, placebo-controlled trials and nationwide prescription registers
from Demark showed that GLP-1RAs were associated with a 53%
reduction in all-cause dementia in patients with T2DM.30 Our large-
scale study of 1,094,761 US patients with T2DM found semaglutide
associated with a 40% to 70% decrease in first-time AD diagnoses,
includinga40%reductioncomparedtootherGLP-1RAs.Ongoingran-
domizedtrialsareassessingsemaglutide’stherapeuticeffectsinearly
AD.10,11 Our findings support conducting future prevention trials to
determine semaglutide’s ability to delay or slow down the onset of
AD.
AD pathology is multifactorial and complex. GLP receptors
are expressed in various organs, influencing multiple intracellular
responsesthatcoulddirectlyaffectADdevelopmentorprogressionin
the brain.25 Insulin dysregulation affects key pathological features of
AD.31
Antidiabetic medications have shown promise in improving cogni-
tion, Aβ clearance, tau phosphorylation, neurotransmitter turnover,
synapticloss,bioenergetics,vascularfunction,inflammation,andlipid
metabolism in AD.31–35 Our study shows that semaglutide signifi-
cantly reduces first-time AD diagnoses compared to other antidia-
betic medications, suggesting potential benefits beyond insulin resis-
tance improvement. This is further supported by the data compar-
ing semaglutide with SGLT2i. Indeed, SGLT2i reduces blood glucose
independent of insulin sensitivity and secretion.36 SGLT2i crosses
the blood–brain barrier and has neuroprotective effects by reduc-
ing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction,
and increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor.37 A recent large

population-based cohort study showed that SGLT2i was associated
with a lower risk of dementia compared with DPP-4i.38 Our study
shows that semaglutide was associated with significantly lower AD
first-time diagnosis compared with SGLT2i, with an effect more pro-
foundthanthatofDPP4i.Thesefindingsalignwithpriorresearchsug-
gesting semaglutide may offer neuroprotective effects via pathways
like neuroinflammation and mitochondrial function beyond insulin
resistanceimprovement.
While the underlying mechanisms of the observed association
of semaglutide and reduced risk of AD are unknown, they could
also reflect semaglutide’s improvement of AD risk factors such as
T2DM,obesity,cardiovasculardiseases,smoking,alcoholdrinking,and
depression, among others. Semaglutide was shown to improve car-
diovascular health in patients with T2DM or obesity.5,6 We recently
reportedthatsemaglutidewasassociatedwithreducedrisksforalco-
hol use disorders7 and tobacco use disorders.8 A large cohort study
in the United States showed that GLP-1RAs including semaglutide
were correlated with lower risk of depression and anxiety.9 Findings
from this study support the idea that semaglutide could help delay or
preventtheonsetofADbymitigatingthesemodifiableriskfactors.
In addition, GLP-1RAs have been reported to influence many
pathways associated with the progression of AD, including oxida-
tive stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered glycation status, and
inflammation.39 GLP-1 receptors have been identified in neurons,
astrocytes, and microglia, all of which have been implicated in the
cascade of events that drive the pathology of AD. These receptors
also exist on macrophages and on cells derived from the macrophage
lineage such as microglia and astrocytes, where their activation can
reduce secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase anti-
inflammatory mediators.40 A recent study showed that semaglutide
reduces the severity of polymicrobial inflammation and neuroinflam-
mationthroughcentralneuronalGLP-1receptors. 41 However,itisnot
possiblefromourstudiestoimplicateanyoftheseinthedelayorpre-
ventionofanADdiagnosis,thoughitseemslikelythatthemechanism
involves more than vigorous blood sugar control, given our compari-
son of antidiabetic drugs and weight loss given our subgroup analysis
byobesitystatus.
Almost two-thirds of AD cases are in women, and the underlying
mechanisms remain unknown.1 In our study, semaglutide was asso-
ciated with a more profound decrease in first-time diagnoses of AD
in women with a HR 0.22 (0.12 to 0.42) than in men with HR 0.48
(0.24 to 0.93), though the confidence intervals overlapped and sam-
plesizeswerelimited.However,thecharacteristicsofthesetwostudy
populations differed, with women being younger than men (average
age 56.8vs 59.6years) and having a higher prevalence of obesity and
depression and a lower prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. This
analysis demonstrates the importance of conducting separate analy-
ses based on gender since the genders’ different characteristics may
inform targeted prevention efforts. Larger, longer-term studies are
neededtoconfirmthesedifferencesandtounderstandwhatdrivesthe
potentialdifferentialeffects.
Obesity is now recognized as a major modifiable risk factor for
AD and related dementias in the United States.42 Semaglutide was
approved as Ozempic for treating T2DM in December 2017 and as
WegovyforweightlossinJune2021.Ourstudypopulationcomprised
patientswithT2DMprescribedsemaglutidebetweenDecember2017
andMay2021,beforeitsapprovalforweightloss.Duetosamplesize
limitations and a shorter follow-up time, we did not include patients
prescribedsemaglutideasWegovyforobesity.However,weconducted
stratifiedanalysesbyobesitystatusamongT2DMpatientsandfound
a consistent decrease in first-time AD diagnosis regardless of obesity
status. These findings suggest that semaglutide may have beneficial
effects on delaying the onset of AD through mechanisms beyond
weightloss.43 Furtherresearchisneededtoinvestigatesemaglutide’s
effectsinpatientswithobesity,bothwithandwithoutT2DM.
Ourstudyhadseverallimitations.First,retrospectiveobservational
studiesusingpatientEHRs,likeours,inherentlycansufferfromover-
diagnosis, underdiagnosis, and misdiagnosis, as well as unmeasured
or uncontrolled confounders and biases, precluding causal inference.
Second, our patient cohort was sourced from the TriNetX Analytics
platform, necessitating validation of results in other EHR databases
andanalyticsplatforms.Third,duetosemaglutide’srecentapprovalfor
treating T2DM, our follow-up period was limited to 3 years. Though
weobservedasignificantreductioninADriskinahigh-riskpopulation

tension),futurestudiesshouldexplorelongerfollow-upsanddifferent
populations.Fourth,weusedtheICD-10diagnosiscodeforADasthe
primaryoutcomeandcorroboratedthefindingsusingAD-relatedmed-
ication prescriptions. However, AD diagnosis is challenging, and the
diagnostic criteria are usually not documented in EHRs, which could
also be influenced by many factors, including socioeconomic factors
and biomarker usage.44 Nevertheless, both exposure and compari-
son groups were drawn from the same healthcare organizations and
were propensity-score matched for more than 50 variables, including
socioeconomicandlifestylefactors,sorelativeratesoffirst-timediag-
nosis of AD as measured by HR are likely valid. Fifth, due to sample
size limitations, this study could not examine the potential therapeu-
tic benefits of semaglutide in patients with AD. A recent randomized
placebo-controlled clinical trial of 204 patients with mild AD showed
that liraglutide, a first-generation GLP-1RA, slowed the reduction in
wholecorticalgraymatterandfrontal,temporal,andparietallobevol-
ume compared to placebo.45 These findings suggest that semaglutide
could offer a promising therapeutic approach to treating AD. Finally,

 ","The article investigates the association between semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and the first-time diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with type 2 diabetes using nationwide real-world data in the US. Target trial emulation was employed to analyze this relationship. The study utilized data from electronic health records and prescription databases. Key findings suggest that semaglutide may have a protective effect against AD development in individuals with type 2 diabetes, though further research is needed to confirm these results.","INTRODUCTION: Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, protects against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. However, real-world evidence for its ability to protect against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is lacking. METHODS: We conducted emulation target trials based on a nationwide database of electronic health records (EHRs) of 116 million US patients. Seven target trials were emulated among 1,094,761 eligible patients with T2DM who had no prior AD diagnosis by comparing semaglutide with seven other antidiabetic medications. First-ever diagnosis of AD occurred within a 3-year follow-up period and was examined using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan–Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: Semaglutide was associated with significantly reduced risk for first-time AD diagnosis, most strongly compared with insulin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33 [95% CI: 0.21 to 0.51]) and most weakly compared with other GLP-1RAs (HR, 0.59 [95% CI: 0.37 to 0.95]). Similar results were seen across obesity status, gender, and age groups. DISCUSSION: These findings support further studies to assess semaglutide’s potential in preventing AD.","An estimated 6.9 million Americans aged 65 and older will be living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in 2024, a number that is projected to increase to 13.8 million by 2060.1 AD has no cure, and about 40% of cases are linked to modifiable risk factors.2 Given its growing prevalence, profound societal and economic impact, and absence of a cure, targeting these modifiable risk factors is crucial to prevent or delay AD and related dementia. 3,4 Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2017 and for weight loss in 2021. Both T2DM and obesity are significant modifiable risk factors for AD. 2 Furthermore, semaglutide has demonstrated benefits in managing various other health conditions such as cardiovascular factors, alcohol use, smoking, and depression,5–9 many of which are also linked to AD risk.2 Given its ability to target these risk factors, we hypothesize that semaglutide may reduce the risk of developing AD in high-risk patients. Two placebo-controlled trials are currently assessing semaglutide’s neuroprotective effects in early AD, 10,11 alongside a study on its impact on the immune system in AD patients. 12 However, there are no clinical trials investigating whether semaglutide can delay or prevent the onset of AD. In this study, we conducted an emulation target trial using real-world electronic health records (EHRs) of T2DM patients without prior AD diagnosis. Our aim was to determine whether semaglutide is associated with a reduced risk for first-time diagnoses of AD in a high-risk population, stratified by gender, age groups, and obesity status.","Figure 1 is a flowchart of the cohort composition. The study included 1,094,761 new users of antidiabetic medications, including 17,104 new users of semaglutide and 1,077,657 new users of other antidiabetic medications. Semaglutide was separately compared with each of the seven antidiabetic medication classes in patients with T2DM. Before propensity-score matching, the insulin and semaglutide groups differed by age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis of obesity, some cardiovascular conditions, and AD-related risk factors and by overall medical encounters including outpatient visits. After propensity-score matching, comparison groups were balanced (Table 1). Patients with T2DM who were prescribed semaglutide had a significantly decreased risk of receiving a first-time diagnosis of AD during a 3-year follow-up compared with those prescribed other antidiabetic medications, with a HR of 0.33 (0.21 to 0.51) compared with insulins and 0.59 (0.37 to 0.95) compared with other GLP-1RAs (Figure 2A). Among older adults aged ≥60 years at the index event (average 67.9 ± 5.79), the overall 3-year risk of first-time diagnosis of AD was twice as high as in the general population (average 58.1 ± 12.1): 0.33% versus 0.16%. Nonetheless, a similar decrease in first-time diagnoses of AD was observed for semaglutide (Figure S2). The 3-year cumulative incidence curves comparing semaglutide with each of the seven antidiabetic medications are shown in Figure 2B. The average follow-up times for semaglutide versus each comparison group are as follows: insulin (973.4 ± 101.3 vs 847.2 ± 190.0 days), metformin (973.4 ± 101.4 vs 921.4 ± 144.2 days), DPP-4i (970.1 ± 103.7 vs 893.1 ± 160.4 days), SGLT2i (969.0 ± 104.3 vs 896.4 ± 157.2 days), SU (971.6 ± 102.5 vs 892.9 ± 162.9 days), TZD (955.8 ± 113.4 vs 868.4 ± 176.0 days), and other GLP-1RAs (973.1 ± 101.5 vs 933.3 ± 133.8 days). The separation between the curves begins within the first 30 days and continues to diverge, indicating the potential sustained benefits of semaglutide in delaying or slowing AD development. After propensity-score matching, there were 8881 women in each of the balanced semaglutide versus insulin groups (average age 56.8 years) and 6895 men in each of the balanced semaglutide versus insulin groups (average age 59.5 years). The characteristics of the semaglutide and insulin groups for women and for men before and after propensity-score matching are presented in Tables S5 and S6. Semaglutide was associated with decreased risk for first-time diagnosis of AD in women with a HR of 0.22 compared with insulins and a HR of 0.53 compared with other GLP-1RAs (Figure 3A). Similar trends were observed in men, though the associations were weaker than in women, but with overlapping confidence intervals (Figure 3B). Among the subpopulation of patients with obesity (who had a recent medical encounter for obesity diagnosis in the past 2 years), semaglutide was associated with decreased risk of first-time diagnosis of AD compared to other antidiabetic medication groups, with a HR of 0.29 compared with insulin and a HR of 0.59 compared with other GLP-1RAs (Figure 4). Similar results were observed in patients without a recent medical encounter with an obesity diagnosis (Figure 4). The characteristics of the semaglutide versus insulin groups for T2DM patients with and without obesity before and after propensity-score matching are presented in Tables S7 and S8. We examined AD-related medication prescriptions (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine, aducanumab, and lecanemab) as an alternative outcome in patients with T2DM who had no prior diagnosis of AD. Semaglutide was associated with a decreased risk of AD-related medication prescriptions compared with other antidiabetic medications in patients with T2DM, with and without obesity (Figure S3), consistent with the main finding based on a first-time diagnosis of AD. As a sensitivity analysis of potential differences in overall healthcare utilization, we compared both the overall and outpatient medical encounters between the matched groups. The semaglutide group did not differ substantially from the comparison groups in overall or outpatient medical encounters, though most of the comparisons were statistically significant, with a HR from 0.87 to 1.14, during a 3-year follow-up (Figure S4)."

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) occur in nearly all patients with Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD). Most frequently they appear since the mild cogni tive impairment
(MCI) stage preceding clinical AD, and have a prognostic importan ce.
Unfortunately, these symptoms also worsen the daily functioni ng of patients,
increase caregiver stress and accelerate the disease progressio n from MCI
to AD. Apathy and depression are the most common of these NPS, an d
much attention has been given in recent years to understand the b iological
mechanisms related to their appearance in AD. Although for many decades
these symptoms have been known to be related to abnormalities of the
dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), a direct associati on between
deﬁcits in the VTA and NPS in AD has never been investigated. Fo rtunately, this
scenario is changing since recent studies using preclinical models of AD, and
clinical studies in MCI and AD patients demonstrated a number o f functional,
structural and metabolic alterations aﬀecting the VTA dopamin ergic neurons
and their mesocorticolimbic targets. These ﬁndings appear early , since the MCI
stage, and seem to correlate with the appearance of NPS. Here, we p rovide an
overview of the recent evidence directly linking the dopaminerg ic VTA with
NPS in AD and propose a setting in which the precocious identiﬁcati on of
dopaminergic deﬁcits can be a helpful biomarker for early diagno sis. In this
scenario, treatments of patients with dopaminergic drugs mig ht slow down
the disease progression and delay the impairment of daily liv ing activities.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the prevailing form of age-associated dementia,
accounting for approximately 60–80% of cases ( 1–3). The neuropathology of AD and the
progressive cognitive decline are highly linked to the presence amyloid-beta (A β ) and
neuroﬁbrillary tangles, whose deposition in the brain ﬁrst appears in neocortical re gions
involved in cognition—mainly the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal formation—
and later spreads to neural hubs that underlie motor and sensory structures, planning ,
emotion and spatial navigation (
4–10).
Frontiers in Psychiatry /zero.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org Krashia et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyt./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum
Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are also particularly
common in the course of the disease, aﬀecting up to half of
patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and nearly all
patients with AD-dementia (
11–14). These symptoms mainly
include depression, anxiety, psychosis, agitation, irritability
and sleep disturbances, although apathy—described as loss of
motivation, decreased interest and lack of emotional reactivity
(
15)—is the most common of these symptoms, with a prevalence
in approximately 50% of MCI and 80% of AD patients ( 16–20).
Due to their appearance since the MCI stage, apathy and
other NPS have an important prognostic value, as they help to
predict the incidence of dementia, conversion from MCI to AD,
and the acceleration in disease progression and cognitive decline
(
13, 21–25). However, the manifestation of these symptoms is
not to be underestimated as they contribute signiﬁcantly to
worsening the daily functioning and disability of patients, they
accelerate and prolong hospitalization and ﬁnancial burden,
and they worsen caregiver distress due to increased reliance
of patients for everyday living (
26, 27). Of note, in line with
the faster disease progression in patients with NPS, recently
an association was observed between apathy and an increased
risk of mortality in dementia and elderly people (
28, 29). Thus,
interventions focused on treating NPS could have an important
impact on patients, caregivers, and society. As such, an increased
knowledge of the biological mechanisms underlying apathy and
other symptoms in AD would result in a better perception of
the disease and its etiology, and could lead to earlier and more
eﬃcient treatments and care planning.
The rising interest in NPS observed in MCI and early AD
patients led to a number of investigations of brain structure
in post-mortem tissue and in metabolic and neuroimaging
studies, to correlate brain alterations with NPS, with main focus
on apathy and depression. These studies appear to highlight
abnormalities/deﬁcits mainly in the medial frontal cortex, as
well as in other brain regions such as the posterior and anterior
cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral
striatum for the development of apathetic or depressive behavior
in subjects with MCI and AD (
30–39). Of note, all of these
regions are interconnected. More importantly still, each region
receives monosynaptic dopaminergic projections from the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain. The widespread
involvement, in apathy and depression, of these brain regions
modulated by dopamine perhaps makes it unsurprising that
these NPS are considered, at least in part, hypodopaminergic
symptoms (
33, 40).
In this Perspective, we will examine in more detail the
particular connections between the dopaminergic VTA and
brain areas involved in the appearance of NPS and other
relevant cognitive symptoms in AD. We will also describe
the most recent preclinical and clinical studies that argue
in favor of a precocious dysfunction of VTA dopaminergic
neurons in AD and its contribution to the early appearance of
NPS. Finally, we will propose a scenario in which the prompt
identiﬁcation of dopaminergic deﬁcits since the MCI stage
and an early dopaminergic-based pharmacological treatment of
patients might be particularly beneﬁcial for improvement of
NPS, and therefore particularly relevant to test the eﬀectiveness
for slowing down the disease progression.
The mesocorticolimbic dopamine
system
The VTA (area A10 in humans) is comprised of a group of
notoriously heterogeneous neurons located near the midline in
the midbrain, in close proximity to the more lateral substantia
nigra pars compacta (SNpc, A9). In addition to dopamine
neurons, the VTA contains GABAergic and glutamatergic
neurons, while some dopaminergic neurons were also shown to
co-release dopamine together with glutamate or GABA (
41, 42).
The mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathway consists of
cell bodies of dopamine neurons located in the VTA, that
send ascending long-projection ﬁbers rostrally toward limbic
and cortical regions through the medial forebrain bundle,
respectively forming the mesolimbic and mesocortical branches
of the mesocorticolimbic system (
Figure 1, Panel A). In recent
years, the use of advanced tracing and optogenetics techniques in
animals, and the improvement in imaging methods, have helped
to well–deﬁne the circuit organization of the mesocorticolimbic
system (
41, 43–50). The most dense mesolimbic innervation
from the dopaminergic VTA is at the level of the nucleus
accumbens (NAc); these ﬁbers then either remain in the NAc,
innervating the core and shell subdomains, or they diverge to
reach their terminal targets by extending toward the dorsal
striatum and other limbic regions such as the amygdala and
hippocampus. The mesocortical ﬁbers instead, after going along
the medial forebrain bundle, either bypass the NAc to extend
dorsally toward the prefrontal cortex (PFC), or cross the
NAc and dorsal striatum en route to the PFC. Of note, the
mesocorticolimbic wiring is one of the last neuronal circuits of
the brain to reach maturity. As observed both in rodents and
non-human primates, this circuitry changes signiﬁcantly not
only during embryonic life and early postnatal development but
also later on, to ﬁnally reach the mature form during adolescence
(
51–54). This peculiar feature of the mesocorticolimbic system
is perhaps the basis for the increased vulnerability of this system
to early-life stress and the many diﬀerent positive or negative
experiences that can drastically, and permanently, shape its
development and function (
55–58).
The vast connections of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine
system with the various cortical, subcortical and limbic regions
reﬂects the heterogeneity of its many functions, further
enhanced by the functional and molecular heterogeneity of
the VTA neurons themselves. In fact, the mesolimbic and
mesocortical dopamine pathways have been shown to diﬀer
in their molecular markers, electrophysiological properties,

anatomical organization and response to various stimuli
(
41, 59–63). This intrinsic variability and extensive neuronal
connections of the mesocorticolimbic system allow for the vast
range of its functions: indeed this system participates, amongst
others, in brain functions like fear, aversion and reward, positive
and negative reinforcement, motivated behavior, working-
, place- and reward-associated memory, object recognition,
decision-making, cognitive and executive functions, goal-
directed behaviors, temporal control and food-intake (
64–
73). It is therefore not surprising that the mesocorticolimbic
system has been highly implicated in a number of mood and
neuropsychiatric disorders, ranging from anxiety, schizophrenia
and depression to food and drug addiction, attention-deﬁcit
disorders and dementia (
66, 72, 74–80).
Dopamine in Alzheimer’s disease
Indirect evidence of mesocorticolimbic
system dysfunctions in AD
It is well–known that the dopaminergic systems undergo
several changes during normal aging. For example, decreased
release of dopamine from its mesocorticolimbic terminals,
reduced dopamine receptor expression, and in particular D2
receptors, or reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) expression
in areas like the putamen, hippocampus and PFC are all
features that are commonly observed in the human brain during
physiological aging (
80–83). Given the link between aging and
dementia, it was not surprising that dopamine has intrigued
neuroscientists also in relevance to AD (
84–87). Thus, a number
of earlier works provided evidence of reduced expression
of dopamine receptors, DAT and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH;
the rate-limiting enzyme necessary for dopamine synthesis)
in post-mortem brains of people with AD, particularly in
mesocorticolimbic areas such as the PFC, NAc and hippocampus
(
88–94). Additionally, these works demonstrated that at least
40% of AD cases also show pathological changes in the VTA
and its dopamine neurons including A β plaques, tangles and
decreased dopamine content (
95–101). Although indirect, the
evidence provided by these works support the notion that the
mesocorticolimbic dopamine system undergoes changes in AD.
Yet, such works could not answer the question of whether the
deﬁcits in the dopaminergic midbrain are an early event, or
one of the many devastating consequences of brain damage
occurring while the disease progresses.
Early functional alterations of the
mesocorticolimbic system in preclinical
AD
Direct evidence supporting the contribution of
dopaminergic system dysfunctions in early AD came from
a preclinical study using the Tg2576 mouse model of AD.
Frontiers in Psychiatry /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org Krashia et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyt./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum
This mouse model overexpresses the human APPswe mutant
(K670M/M671L) allele of familial AD (
102). With more than
1,000 papers published over the last 20 years, this transgenic
model is characterized by a particularly slow disease progression
and has thus been essential for disentangling the early
mechanisms underlying the disease (
102–104). Indeed, Tg2576
mice develop early synaptic alterations in the hippocampus
and cortex, reduced spine density of hippocampal pyramidal
neurons, changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and deﬁcits
in memory and cognition that start since about 3 months of
age (
102–110).
The evidence linking the dopaminergic VTA with these early
deﬁcits in Tg2576 mice came after the observation of substantial
apoptotic cell death of VTA dopamine neurons in these mice,
accompanied by signiﬁcant levels of local neuroinﬂammation,
starting between 2–3 months of age and progressively worsening
with age (
111). The work by Nobili, et al., and subsequent
papers, showed that the progressive degeneration of VTA TH +
neurons results in lower dopamine outﬂow in the hippocampus
and correlates temporally with impairments in hippocampal
neuronal function, synaptic plasticity, spatial memory and fear-
associated memory performance (
111–113). On the other hand,
other brain regions containing TH + neurons, in particular the
SNpc and locus coeruleus (LC), are intact in Tg2576 mice at least
until 6 months of age, suggesting that the early degeneration
is selective for mesocorticolimbic neurons in the VTA and can
account for the AD-like memory symptoms in these mice (
114).
Importantly, subchronic in-vivo treatment of Tg2576 mice
with levodopa (L-DOPA; the natural dopamine precursor) or
selegiline (an inhibitor of dopamine degradation by monoamine
oxidase B) can completely rescue synaptic plasticity, pyramidal
neuron excitability and memory deﬁcits (
111, 112), in line
with previous evidence using diﬀerent dopaminergic treatments
(
115–121). Similarly, a pro-autophagic treatment targeting the
VTA dopamine neurons in Tg2576 mice, eﬀective in delaying
the neurodegenerative process, could also ameliorate the AD
phenotype (
122).
Since the early work in Tg2576 mice, alterations in the
VTA, reductions of DAT in the hippocampus and loss of TH +
neurons were also observed in other mouse models of AD
(3× Tg-AD, APPswe/PS11E9 and 5xFAD) (
123–126). Overall,
these works highlighted the dopaminergic VTA as a brain
region associated with early AD, showing that the reduction of
the mesocorticolimbic dopamine input precedes degeneration,
inﬂammation or plaque formation in target areas, indicating
also that hippocampal-related memory dysfunction in AD is
secondary to VTA dopamine neuron degeneration. Of note,
given the fact that the Tg2576 mouse overexpresses the APPswe
mutation, one can assume that the early degeneration of the
dopaminergic VTA can be associated with the higher levels
of soluble and neurotoxic A β oligomers in this mouse, at
a stage when insoluble A β (Aβ plaque deposition) is still
undetectable (
111). Indeed, A β oligomers have been found
to impair autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics in AD, as
demonstrated in cellular models and in dopaminergic neurons
of the Tg2576 mouse model, thus contributing to cell death
(
122, 127, 128).
Importantly, the paper by Nobili et al., could explain not
only memory deﬁcits but also the occurrence of NPS in AD
(
111–114). This conclusion mainly derived from the evidence
that the degeneration of VTA dopamine neurons in Tg2576
mice, and the sebsequent reduction of dopaminergic innervation
in limbic brain areas related to reward, stress and emotional
processing (
129)—such as the NAc and ventral hippocampus—
were associated with deﬁcits during consumption of palatable
food, aﬀecting not only the ability of Tg2576 animals to
favor an agreeable food such as chocolate over normal
chow, but also reducing the overall levels of consumption.
This depressive-like behavior in Tg2576 mice was completely
rescued by selegiline, as sub-chronic treatment levels could
improve impairments in mesolimbic reward processing by
enhancing, in treated Tg2576 mice, the preference for chocolate
eating and the amount of consumption (
111). Although
interpretations of results from animal behavioral studies,
particularly in relevance to neuropsychiatric features of human
diseases, are inherently complicated, this study could prove
a ﬁrst link between mesocorticolimbic dopamine deﬁcits,
neuropsychiatric-like deﬁcits and AD at an early pre-plaque
disease stage.
Mesocorticolimbic system dysfunctions
in MCI and AD
Given the small size of brainstem nuclei like the VTA
(approximately 60,000 dopamine neurons in the adult human
brain), the resolution power of imaging techniques in humans
has been a limiting factor that likely contributed to the
neglection of such small brain regions from AD screening in the
past. The ﬁrst study on human subjects showing direct evidence
of a functional disconnection of the VTA with brain areas
normally aﬀected in AD was the study by Serra, et al. (
130). The
authors recruited large numbers of amnestic MCI and sporadic
AD patients as well as healthy controls and used resting-
state functional MRI (rs-fMRI at 3T) to assess the functional
connectivity between the VTA and diﬀerent brain areas (
130).
The study showed a signiﬁcant disconnection between the VTA
and the thalamus, medial-temporal regions and the parietal lobe
in MCI patients. As the disease advanced to the AD stage,
patients demonstrated additionally functional disconnection of
the posterior parietal cortex with the LC. The disconnection
from the VTA was mainly present in the hippocampus and
parietal regions in MCI patients, while in AD it involved most
regions of the default-mode network (
130–132). A parallel study
used structural MRI to link the volume of the VTA with typical

AD clinical markers, in particular hippocampal size and memory
index (
133, 134). The main ﬁnding of the study was that the VTA
volume is strongly associated with the size of the hippocampal
formation and memory abilities of both AD patients and healthy
controls, thus indicating that a smaller VTA size or shrinkage of
the nucleus might correspond to a worse memory performance
and smaller hippocampus. This conclusion did not involve the
entire midbrain, since no association was observed between the
SNpc and the size of the hippocampus in AD patients (
133).
Interestingly, the study by Serra, et al. ( 130) was the ﬁrst to
observe a direct association between functional disconnections
of the VTA and early NPS since the MCI stage (
Table 1):
comparison of patients with and without these symptoms
conﬁrmed that patients with apathy, depression or anxiety
showed a stronger disconnection between the VTA and the
default-mode network. Subsequent studies showed additional
deﬁcits that mostly aﬀect the mesocorticolimbic system, while
leaving the nigrostriatal system largely intact. For example, by
combining structural MRI and 18F-FDG-PET glucose metabolic
data, Iaccarino et al., showed signiﬁcant tissue atrophy, reduced
metabolism and widespread loss of gray matter in VTA targets
in the medial temporal lobe related to memory performance, but
also in targets related to NPS such as the ventral striatum, orbito-
frontal cortices and amygdala in both MCI and AD patients
Frontiers in Psychiatry /zero.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.org Krashia et al. /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpsyt./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./one.tnum/zero.tnum/three.tnum/nine.tnum/seven.tnum/two.tnum/five.tnum
(136). On the other hand, regions of the nigrostriatal pathway
exhibited fewer alterations ( 136, 139). Similar results were
obtained with a DAT-Scan [(123I)FP-CIT-SPECT], focusing
speciﬁcally on the dopaminergic innervations (
140).
An interesting ﬁnding was that the degree of loss of
dopaminergic inputs in the various brain targets examined
was analogous between the MCI and AD-with-dementia stages,
suggesting that the dopaminergic dysfunction is an early event
that also reaches a plateau early along the disease progression
(
140). Of note, these studies also conﬁrmed that the extend of
gray matter atrophy in mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic targets
since the MCI stage was associated with greater severity of
NPS, in particular depression linked to the meso-cortical route,
anxiety linked to the mesolimbic route, and apathy linked to
the mesohippocampal/meso-amygdaloid route (
136). Indeed,
stronger loss of gray matter in dopaminergic pathways was also
paralleled by a worsening not only of episodic memory but also
of behavioral alterations, related to the emergence of psychiatric
symptoms and delusions in patients with AD (
137). Given the
link between the mesocorticolimbic dopamine and NPS, and the
fact that these symptoms speed up the disease progression, it is
not surprising that functional disconnection of the VTA with
mesocorticolimbic targets can accelerate the conversion from
the MCI stage to clinical AD (
137, 141, 142).
Conclusions: Implications for early
diagnosis and treatment
Overall, the above mentioned clinical studies show that the
various functional, structural or metabolic alterations aﬀecting
the dopaminergic VTA and its mesocorticolimbic targets since
the MCI stage (
Figure 1, panel B) are a very precocious
phenomenon in the disease progression, that can be related with
the early appearance of NPS. In fact, today the assessment of
CSF biomarkers and the application of the Neuropsychiatric
Inventory (NPI) for evaluation of NPS are standard clinical
practices, with a strong proven link between the two, such
as increased levels of total (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-
tau) proteins and low levels of A β 42 correlating with apathy,
anxiety, agitation, and irritability (
143–148). Combined with
these diagnostic tools, early identiﬁcation of alterations in
the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system could provide an
additional valid biomarker aimed at the prognosis of NPS and
thus prediction of disease acceleration and faster conversion
from MCI to AD.
Another aspect to consider is the possibility of early
intervention based on a pharmacological treatment against
dopamine-related symptoms since the MCI stage, with the aim
of slowing down their appearance, improving the quality of life
and delaying the conversion to AD. Several dopaminergic drugs
have already shown to have positive eﬀects in mild-AD patients
(
80, 149–153), but their eﬀectiveness as agents that can delay
conversion from MCI to AD has yet to be investigated. Also,
these earlier clinical trials with dopaminergic drugs have focused
mainly on cognitive rather that neuropsychiatric deﬁcits. Yet,
today there is increasing demand for the approval of speciﬁc
drugs for the treatment of NPS in AD, considering also that no
such drugs have been approved so far by the FDA. Indeed, drugs
usually prescribed to patients with NPS are often anxiolytics,
atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants or mood stabilizers, all
unapproved for AD, with uncertain eﬃcacy and important
adverse eﬀects (
154–158). Thus, focused clinical trials that are
speciﬁc for NPS in MCI and AD are essential. Fortunately,
progress in this ﬁeld is starting to emerge with speciﬁc focus on
catecholamine reuptake inhibitors like methylphenidate (
159–
162).
Since disease-modifying treatments have failed, new studies
need to focus on a paradigm shift for preventing and treating
AD. The emerging experimental and clinical results pinpoint
the VTA atrophy as a supportive feature for the diagnosis of
probable AD and a target for next pharmacological treatment.

Frontiers in Psychiatry /one.tnum/zero.tnum frontiersin.org ","Genetic and neurobiological factors influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Apathy, anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline are common. Treatment options include pharmacological therapies like rasagiline, methylphenidate, and rotigotine for NPS in AD. Cognitive effects of atypical antipsychotics are also reviewed. Disease-modifying treatments are limited, highlighting the need for symptomatic therapies. Clinical trials such as ADMET 2 and pimavanserin show promise but further research is needed to improve treatment outcomes.","Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) occur in nearly all patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Most frequently they appear since the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage preceding clinical AD, and have a prognostic importance. Unfortunately, these symptoms also worsen the daily functioning of patients, increase caregiver stress and accelerate the disease progression from MCI to AD. Apathy and depression are the most common of these NPS, and much attention has been given in recent years to understand the biological mechanisms related to their appearance in AD. Although for many decades these symptoms have been known to be related to abnormalities of the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), a direct association between deficits in the VTA and NPS in AD has never been investigated. Fortunately, this scenario is changing since recent studies using preclinical models of AD, and clinical studies in MCI and AD patients demonstrated a number of functional, structural and metabolic alterations affecting the VTA dopaminergic neurons and their mesocorticolimbic targets. These findings appear early, since the MCI stage, and seem to correlate with the appearance of NPS. Here, we provide an overview of the recent evidence directly linking the dopaminergic VTA with NPS in AD and propose a setting in which the precocious identification of dopaminergic deficits can be a helpful biomarker for early diagnosis. In this scenario, treatments of patients with dopaminergic drugs might slow down the disease progression and delay the impairment of daily living activities.","Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the prevailing form of age-associated dementia, accounting for approximately 60–80% of cases (1–3). The neuropathology of AD and the progressive cognitive decline are highly linked to the presence amyloid-beta (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles, whose deposition in the brain first appears in neocortical regions involved in cognition—mainly the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal formation—and later spreads to neural hubs that underlie motor and sensory structures, planning, emotion and spatial navigation (4–10). Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are also particularly common in the course of the disease, affecting up to half of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and nearly all patients with AD-dementia (11–14). These symptoms mainly include depression, anxiety, psychosis, agitation, irritability and sleep disturbances, although apathy—described as loss of motivation, decreased interest and lack of emotional reactivity (15)—is the most common of these symptoms, with a prevalence in approximately 50% of MCI and 80% of AD patients (16–20). Due to their appearance since the MCI stage, apathy and other NPS have an important prognostic value, as they help to predict the incidence of dementia, conversion from MCI to AD, and the acceleration in disease progression and cognitive decline (13, 21–25). However, the manifestation of these symptoms is not to be underestimated as they contribute significantly to worsening the daily functioning and disability of patients, they accelerate and prolong hospitalization and financial burden, and they worsen caregiver distress due to increased reliance of patients for everyday living (26, 27). Of note, in line with the faster disease progression in patients with NPS, recently an association was observed between apathy and an increased risk of mortality in dementia and elderly people (28, 29). Thus, interventions focused on treating NPS could have an important impact on patients, caregivers, and society. As such, an increased knowledge of the biological mechanisms underlying apathy and other symptoms in AD would result in a better perception of the disease and its etiology, and could lead to earlier and more efficient treatments and care planning. The rising interest in NPS observed in MCI and early AD patients led to a number of investigations of brain structure in post-mortem tissue and in metabolic and neuroimaging studies, to correlate brain alterations with NPS, with main focus on apathy and depression. These studies appear to highlight abnormalities/deficits mainly in the medial frontal cortex, as well as in other brain regions such as the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum for the development of apathetic or depressive behavior in subjects with MCI and AD (30–39). Of note, all of these regions are interconnected. More importantly still, each region receives monosynaptic dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain. The widespread involvement, in apathy and depression, of these brain regions modulated by dopamine perhaps makes it unsurprising that these NPS are considered, at least in part, hypodopaminergic symptoms (33, 40). In this Perspective, we will examine in more detail the particular connections between the dopaminergic VTA and brain areas involved in the appearance of NPS and other relevant cognitive symptoms in AD. We will also describe the most recent preclinical and clinical studies that argue in favor of a precocious dysfunction of VTA dopaminergic neurons in AD and its contribution to the early appearance of NPS. Finally, we will propose a scenario in which the prompt identification of dopaminergic deficits since the MCI stage and an early dopaminergic-based pharmacological treatment of patients might be particularly beneficial for improvement of NPS, and therefore particularly relevant to test the effectiveness for slowing down the disease progression.","Indirect evidence of mesocorticolimbic system dysfunctions in AD. It is well–known that the dopaminergic systems undergo several changes during normal aging. For example, decreased release of dopamine from its mesocorticolimbic terminals, reduced dopamine receptor expression, and in particular D2 receptors, or reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in areas like the putamen, hippocampus and PFC are all features that are commonly observed in the human brain during physiological aging (80–83). Given the link between aging and dementia, it was not surprising that dopamine has intrigued neuroscientists also in relevance to AD (84–87). Thus, a number of earlier works provided evidence of reduced expression of dopamine receptors, DAT and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; the rate-limiting enzyme necessary for dopamine synthesis) in post-mortem brains of people with AD, particularly in mesocorticolimbic areas such as the PFC, NAc and hippocampus (88–94). Additionally, these works demonstrated that at least 40% of AD cases also show pathological changes in the VTA and its dopamine neurons including Aβ plaques, tangles and decreased dopamine content (95–101). Although indirect, the evidence provided by these works support the notion that the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system undergoes changes in AD. Yet, such works could not answer the question of whether the deficits in the dopaminergic midbrain are an early event, or one of the many devastating consequences of brain damage occurring while the disease progresses. Early functional alterations of the mesocorticolimbic system in preclinical AD. Direct evidence supporting the contribution of dopaminergic system dysfunctions in early AD came from a preclinical study using the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. This mouse model overexpresses the human APPswe mutant (K670M/M671L) allele of familial AD (102). With more than 1,000 papers published over the last 20 years, this transgenic model is characterized by a particularly slow disease progression and has thus been essential for disentangling the early mechanisms underlying the disease (102–104). Indeed, Tg2576 mice develop early synaptic alterations in the hippocampus and cortex, reduced spine density of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and deficits in memory and cognition that start since about 3 months of age (102–110). The evidence linking the dopaminergic VTA with these early deficits in Tg2576 mice came after the observation of substantial apoptotic cell death of VTA dopamine neurons in these mice, accompanied by significant levels of local neuroinflammation, starting between 2–3 months of age and progressively worsening with age (111). The work by Nobili, et al., and subsequent papers, showed that the progressive degeneration of VTA TH+ neurons results in lower dopamine outflow in the hippocampus and correlates temporally with impairments in hippocampal neuronal function, synaptic plasticity, spatial memory and fear-associated memory performance (111–113). On the other hand, other brain regions containing TH+ neurons, in particular the SNpc and locus coeruleus (LC), are intact in Tg2576 mice at least until 6 months of age, suggesting that the early degeneration is selective for mesocorticolimbic neurons in the VTA and can account for the AD-like memory symptoms in these mice (114). Importantly, subchronic in-vivo treatment of Tg2576 mice with levodopa (L-DOPA; the natural dopamine precursor) or selegiline (an inhibitor of dopamine degradation by monoamine oxidase B) can completely rescue synaptic plasticity, pyramidal neuron excitability and memory deficits (111, 112), in line with previous evidence using different dopaminergic treatments (115–121). Similarly, a pro-autophagic treatment targeting the VTA dopamine neurons in Tg2576 mice, effective in delaying the neurodegenerative process, could also ameliorate the AD phenotype (122). Since the early work in Tg2576 mice, alterations in the VTA, reductions of DAT in the hippocampus and loss of TH+ neurons were also observed in other mouse models of AD (3× Tg-AD, APPswe/PS11E9 and 5xFAD) (123–126). Overall, these works highlighted the dopaminergic VTA as a brain region associated with early AD, showing that the reduction of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine input precedes degeneration, inflammation or plaque formation in target areas, indicating also that hippocampal-related memory dysfunction in AD is secondary to VTA dopamine neuron degeneration. Of note, given the fact that the Tg2576 mouse overexpresses the APPswe mutation, one can assume that the early degeneration of the dopaminergic VTA can be associated with the higher levels of soluble and neurotoxic Aβ oligomers in this mouse, at a stage when insoluble Aβ (Aβ plaque deposition) is still undetectable (111). Indeed, Aβ oligomers have been found to impair autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics in AD, as demonstrated in cellular models and in dopaminergic neurons of the Tg2576 mouse model, thus contributing to cell death (122, 127, 128). Importantly, the paper by Nobili et al., could explain not only memory deficits but also the occurrence of NPS in AD (111–114). This conclusion mainly derived from the evidence that the degeneration of VTA dopamine neurons in Tg2576 mice, and the sebsequent reduction of dopaminergic innervation in limbic brain areas related to reward, stress and emotional processing (129)—such as the NAc and ventral hippocampus—were associated with deficits during consumption of palatable food, affecting not only the ability of Tg2576 animals to favor an agreeable food such as chocolate over normal chow, but also reducing the overall levels of consumption. This depressive-like behavior in Tg2576 mice was completely rescued by selegiline, as sub-chronic treatment levels could improve impairments in mesolimbic reward processing by enhancing, in treated Tg2576 mice, the preference for chocolate eating and the amount of consumption (111). Although interpretations of results from animal behavioral studies, particularly in relevance to neuropsychiatric features of human diseases, are inherently complicated, this study could prove a first link between mesocorticolimbic dopamine deficits, neuropsychiatric-like deficits and AD at an early pre-plaque disease stage. Mesocorticolimbic system dysfunctions in MCI and AD. Given the small size of brainstem nuclei like the VTA (approximately 60,000 dopamine neurons in the adult human brain), the resolution power of imaging techniques in humans has been a limiting factor that likely contributed to the neglection of such small brain regions from AD screening in the past. The first study on human subjects showing direct evidence of a functional disconnection of the VTA with brain areas normally affected in AD was the study by Serra, et al. (130). The authors recruited large numbers of amnestic MCI and sporadic AD patients as well as healthy controls and used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI at 3T) to assess the functional connectivity between the VTA and different brain areas (130). The study showed a significant disconnection between the VTA and the thalamus, medial-temporal regions and the parietal lobe in MCI patients. As the disease advanced to the AD stage, patients demonstrated additionally functional disconnection of the posterior parietal cortex with the LC. The disconnection from the VTA was mainly present in the hippocampus and parietal regions in MCI patients, while in AD it involved most regions of the default-mode network (130–132). A parallel study used structural MRI to link the volume of the VTA with typical AD clinical markers, in particular hippocampal size and memory index (133, 134). The main finding of the study was that the VTA volume is strongly associated with the size of the hippocampal formation and memory abilities of both AD patients and healthy controls, thus indicating that a smaller VTA size or shrinkage of the nucleus might correspond to a worse memory performance and smaller hippocampus. This conclusion did not involve the entire midbrain, since no association was observed between the SNpc and the size of the hippocampus in AD patients (133). Interestingly, the study by Serra, et al. (130) was the first to observe a direct association between functional disconnections of the VTA and early NPS since the MCI stage (Table 1): comparison of patients with and without these symptoms confirmed that patients with apathy, depression or anxiety showed a stronger disconnection between the VTA and the default-mode network. Subsequent studies showed additional deficits that mostly affect the mesocorticolimbic system, while leaving the nigrostriatal system largely intact. For example, by combining structural MRI and 18F-FDG-PET glucose metabolic data, Iaccarino et al., showed significant tissue atrophy, reduced metabolism and widespread loss of gray matter in VTA targets in the medial temporal lobe related to memory performance, but also in targets related to NPS such as the ventral striatum, orbito-frontal cortices and amygdala in both MCI and AD patients (136). On the other hand, regions of the nigrostriatal pathway exhibited fewer alterations (136, 139). Similar results were obtained with a DAT-Scan [(123I)FP-CIT-SPECT], focusing specifically on the dopaminergic innervations (140). An interesting finding was that the degree of loss of dopaminergic inputs in the various brain targets examined was analogous between the MCI and AD-with-dementia stages, suggesting that the dopaminergic dysfunction is an early event that also reaches a plateau early along the disease progression (140). Of note, these studies also confirmed that the extend of gray matter atrophy in mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic targets since the MCI stage was associated with greater severity of NPS, in particular depression linked to the meso-cortical route, anxiety linked to the mesolimbic route, and apathy linked to the mesohippocampal/meso-amygdaloid route (136). Indeed, stronger loss of gray matter in dopaminergic pathways was also paralleled by a worsening not only of episodic memory but also of behavioral alterations, related to the emergence of psychiatric symptoms and delusions in patients with AD (137). Given the link between the mesocorticolimbic dopamine and NPS, and the fact that these symptoms speed up the disease progression, it is not surprising that functional disconnection of the VTA with mesocorticolimbic targets can accelerate the conversion from the MCI stage to clinical AD (137, 141, 142)."

ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by pro-
gressive cognitive and memory-related impairment. However, current therapeutic treatments have not
proved sufficiently effective, mainly due to the complicated pathogenesis of the disease. In this study,
a nano-formulation of graphene oxide (GO) loaded with dauricine (Dau) was investigated in terms of
the combined anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects of Dau and the inhibition of misfold-
ing and aggregation of the amyloid-b (Ab) protein by GO. Both in vivo and in vitro models were
induced using Ab
1-42, and the formulation was administered nasally in mice. The results showed that
GO loaded with Dau greatly reduced oxidative stress through increasing superoxide dismutase levels
and decreasing reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levelsin vitro; it also alleviated the cog-
nitive memory deficits and brain glial cell activation in mice with Ab1-42-induced AD. This proved that
GO loaded with Dau could protect against Ab1-42-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in both
in vitro and in vivo AD models; therefore, GO loaded with Dau has the potential to be an effective and
agent for the rapid treatment of AD.

1. Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of
dementia in the elderly. It is characterized by progressive
development after an insidious onset, and no cure has been
developed as yet. Thus, AD remains an enormous financial
and social burden for patients and their families due to the
terrible and devastating loss of cognition and decline in daily
behavior it causes (Uzun et al.,2011; Fransquet et al.,2018).
Moreover, the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear, and the
simultaneous effects of a variety of causes are believed to be
responsible for the onset of the disease. According to the
most influential hypothesis of AD pathogenesis, the misfold-
ing of the amyloid-b (Ab) peptide to form toxic oligomers
and fibrils in brain tissue is considered as a key factor in AD.
The aggregation of neurotoxic Ab leads to increased oxida-
tive stress and inflammation in the brain, promoting neur-
onal apoptosis (Butterfield et al., 2013). This eventually
results in chronic and irreversible brain tissue damage and
multiple neurological impairments, resulting in significant
memory deficits and impaired judgment (Butterfield & Boyd-
Kimball, 2018; Ziegler-Waldkirch et al.,2018). Therefore, there
is an urgent need to develop novel agents for the treatment
of AD.
Dauricine (Dau) is a dibenzyl tetrahydroisoquinoline alkal-
oid extracted and isolated from the rhizome ofMenispermum
dauricum. Several studies have shown that Dau exhibited
anti-proliferative activity against several different types of
malignant cell (Zhang et al., 2018, 2019; Zhou et al., 2019).
Dau can regulate the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins
through the mitochondrial pathway, inhibit cell apoptosis,
and have a protective effect against brain damage (Li &
Gong, 2007). Studies have also shown that Dau down-regu-
lated caspase-3, alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress, and
had protective effects in a nematode model of AD by stimu-
lating the IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling pathway (Pu et al.,2018); it
also had a strong antioxidant effect against acute oxidative
damage (Wang et al., 2020). However, the short half-life,
rapid metabolism, and certain cytotoxic effects of Dau (Wei
et al., 2015; Liu & Liu, 2016) greatly limit its applicability for
the treatment of AD.
Recently, multifunctional drug-loaded nanosystems have
emerged as an effective treatment strategy to treat complex
and refractory diseases (Yoon et al., 2015; Jansook et al.,
2018; Lv et al.,2018). As the processing product of graphene,
graphene oxide (GO) has several advantages over in terms of
higher specific surface area, better water solubility and bio-
compatibility. Polymers and drugs can be linked to GO par-
ticles by covalent or non-covalent binding, resulting in high
drug loading (Parviz & Strano,2018). Moreover, low concen-

https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2021.1895909 induced cell apoptosis (Yang et al.,2015). Thus, drug delivery
systems based on GO have the potential to be used as
multi-targeted and more efficient therapeutic strategies
for AD.
However, in the clinical setting, the most difficult problem
in the treatment of AD is the unique blood – brain and
blood– cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the central nervous sys-
tem, which intercept toxic and macromolecular substances,
but also block therapeutic drugs. This is also the main reason
for the poor therapeutic efficacy and peripheral adverse reac-
tions of AD drugs (Henrich-Noack et al.,2019; Langen et al.,
2019). Therefore, intranasal administration, which enables
noninvasive delivery from the nose to the brain, was used in
animal experiments in this study – the drug is introduced
from the nose into the cerebrospinal fluid, and then into the
extracellular fluid of brain tissue after passing through the
blood– brain barrier. The success of several nasal drugs on
the market is indicative of the potential advantages over
traditional administration routes (Kamei et al., 2018;L i
et al., 2019).
In the present study, we investigated GO nanoparticles
loaded with Dau (hereafter referred to as GO@Dau) as a
novel therapeutic drug for AD and compared itsin vivo and
in vitro neuroprotective effects on A b
1-42-induced AD with
those of GO or Dau alone.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
Dau (purity > 98%) was procured from Chengdu Must Bio-
Technology Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). GO dispersion was
purchased from Jiangsu XFNANO Materials Tech. Co., Ltd.
(Nanjing, China). Ab
1-42 was obtained from Jill Biochemical
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Except for the CCK-8 assay kit
(Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), all the other kits used were
ordered from Beyotime (Shanghai, China). Monoclonal anti-
bodies against a-tubulin, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax),
Bcl-2, caspase-3, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1),
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein, and Iba-1 and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
anti-rabbit/mouse IgG secondary antibody were purchased
from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). All chemicals used were of
high purity analytical grade.
2.2. Cell culture and preparation of aggregated Ab1-42
Human SH-SY5Y cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum
and 1% 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin in an incubator
in 5% CO
2 at 37/C14 C.
Aggregated Ab1-42 was prepared as previously described
(Ye et al., 2015). Briefly, Ab1-42 was dissolved in hexafluoroi-
sopropanol to a concentration of 2 mg/mL. The resulting
solution was transferred into smaller tubes and evaporated
in a biochemical fume hood, and the peptide membrane
obtained was stored at /C0 80
/C14 C until further use. For the
in vitro experiments, the Ab1-42 peptide membrane was incu-
bated at 37/C14 C for two days before use.
For animal experiments, A b1-42 was dissolved in 0.9%
saline at a final concentration of 1mg/mL, and incubated for
seven days at 37/C14 C for aggregation (Xie et al.,2018).
2.3. Animals and drug administration
All experimental procedures using mice received specific
approval from the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee
(IAEC) of Guilin Medical University (protocol no.: GLMC-
201905013), and all efforts were made to minimize animal
suffering. Male C57BL/6 mice (aged 2 – 3 months, weight
20– 28 g) were selected for in vivo experiments. Mice were
housed at 22 ± 2
/C14 C on a 12 h light/dark cycle with free
access to water and standard rodent diet.
2.4. Synthesis and characterization of GO and GO@Dau
2.4.1. Preparation of GO@Dau
First, in order to ensure the uniformity of GO particle size,
Tween 80 was added to a final concentration of 1% in the
GO dispersion, and then ultrasonic disrupted for 30 min, after
which the solution was filtered through a 0.45lm membrane
filter and stored at 4
/C14 C until further use. One milliliter of
0.5 mg/mL Dau was added to 25 mL of this GO dispersion
and stirred at 25
/C14 C for 24 h. Thereafter, the solution was fil-
tered through a 0.45 lm membrane filter, centrifuged at
13,000 rpm and 4 /C14 C for 1 h, and freeze-dried to obtain
GO@Dau as the precipitate.
2.4.2. Particle size and zeta potential
The particle size and zeta potential of GO and GO@Dau were
measured using light scattering (NanoBrook 90Plus PALS;
Brookhaven, NY).
2.4.3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The percentage of drug loading was determined by stirring
5 mg GO@Dau in 100 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at
pH 7.4 for 48 h. The obtained suspension was centrifuged
and the Dau content was determined at 281 nm using high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (LC-2030,
Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Drug loading percentage and
encapsulation efficiency percentage were calculated using
the following formulae:
Percent drug loading ¼ð W
total dau /C0 Wfree dau Þ=WGO@Dau
/C2 100%
Percent encapsulation efficiency
¼ð Wtotal dau /C0 Wfree dau Þ=Wtotal dau /C2 100%
2.5. Cell viability assay
The CCK-8 assay was used to determine cell viability as previ-
ously described (Cheng et al.,2018), Briefly, undifferentiated
DRUG DELIVERY 581 SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in 96-well plates (6000 cells/well)
and allowed to adhere for 24 h at 37 /C14 Ci n5 %C O 2.
Thereafter, the culture medium was removed and the cells
were treated with the experimental drug medium. After
appropriate incubation, the drug medium was removed and
10 lL of CCK-8 solution was added and incubated for 1– 2h
at 37
/C14 C. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a micro-
plate reader (Infinite 200 Pro; Tecan, Gr€odig, Austria). The cell
viability was calculated based on the absorbance ratio with
reference to that in the control group.
2.6. Intracellular ROS level assay
The fluorescent probe 2 0,70-dichlorofluorescin diacetate
(DCFH-DA) was used to measure intracellular ROS levels.
Briefly, SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in six-well plates (8/C2 10
4
cells/well) and cultured for 24 h at 37/C14 Ci n5 %C O2. Culture
medium was then removed and the following drugs were
added: 0.1% DMSO (control group), 30 lMA b
1-42 (model
group), 30 lMA b1-42þ2 mM Dau (Dau group), 30 lMA b1-
42þ1 mM Dau (OD group), 30lMA b1-42þ23 mg/mL GO (GO
group), and 30 lMA b1-42þ25 mg/mL GO@Dau (GO@Dau
group, equivalent to 2mM Dau). Here, we chose two concen-
trations of Dau– one was the optimal therapeutic concentra-
tion (in the OD group) and the other was the amount
contained in GO@Dau (in the Dau group). After 48 h, the
cells were incubated with DCFH-DA at a final concentration
of 5 lMa t3 7
/C14 C for 30 min and then washed with culture
medium without serum three times. Fluorescent intensities
at 488 nm/525 nm (excitation/emission) wavelength were
determined and images were obtained using a fluorescence
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The final data are rep-
resented in terms of the ratios of the fluorescence intensities
with reference to the control group as quantified using
ImageJ (1.49 V, NIH, Bethesda, MD).
2.7. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde
(MDA) levels assay
Lipid peroxidation in SH-SY5Y cells was determined based on
the levels of SOD and MDA using commercial kits. The SH-
SY5Y cell drug treatment groups are as described inSection
2.6. Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA
Assay kit. After treatment, the cells were collected and then
processed according to the manufacturer ’s instructions for
SOD level analysis.
Drug treated cells were washed with PBS, lysed in radio-
immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, and centrifuged at
12,000/C2 g for 30 min at 4/C14 C. The supernatant was collected
to analyze the MDA content.
2.8. Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis and necrosis were assessed using a one-step ter-
minal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) apoptosis assay kit. The drug treatment groups were
the same as described in Section 2.6, and samples were
processed according to the manufacturer ’s instructions.
Fluorescent intensities at 550 nm/570 nm (excitation/emis-
sion) wavelength were determined and images were
obtained using a fluorescence microscope. The final data are
represented in terms of the ratios of the fluorescence inten-
sities with reference to the control group as quantified
using ImageJ.
2.9. Establishment of AD model and administration
The AD model was established by subjecting mice to an
intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated Ab1-42 (1 lg/
lL) using a microinjector. Mice were anesthetized by an
intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (0.4 g/kg body
weight) and mounted on a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting,
Wood Dale, IL). An incision was made in the skull along the
cranial midline sagittal line to expose bregma completely.
The location of the injection site was verified according to
The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, second edition:
2 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.5 mm from the biparietal
suture, and 2 mm under the skull. Five microliters saline or
aggregated Ab
1-42 (1 lg/lL) was injected into the brain using
a microinjector over 5 min. After injection, the needle was
left in place for another 5 min, and then pulled out slowly.
The mice were given one day to recover, after which they
were intranasally administrated with the appropriate drugs
every other day.
A total of 120 mice were used in this study. Twenty mice
in the sham operation group were injected with 5lL 0.9%
saline into the lateral ventricle. The remaining 100 mice were
randomly divided into five groups after AD surgery and
treated as follows: the control group was subjected to AD
surgery and treated with 0.9% saline; the Dau group was
subjected to AD surgery, then treated with 0.03 g/kg Dau;
the OD group (with the optimal concentration of Dau) was
subjected to AD surgery and treated with 0.015 g/kg Dau;
the GO group was treated with 0.40 g/kg GO after AD sur-
gery; and the GO@Dau group was treated with 0.43 g/kg
GO@Dau (equivalent to 0.03 g/kg Dau) after AD surgery.
Behavioral experiments were performed using the open field
test (OFT) and the Morris water maze (MWM) to evaluate
memory and learning capacity from days 14 to 21. Finally,
the mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of
pentobarbital (150 mg/kg), and brains were collected for
pathological analyses and protein assessment. The schedule
of animal experiments is shown inFigure 1.
2.10. Behavioral studies
We finally selected mice that survived after brain surgery
and drug administration; we also screened out mice that
could not crawl and swim. Behavioral study data were col-
lected by two trained researchers blinded to the group
allocations.
2.10.1. OFT
The OFT was performed on the first day after the end of
administration. Each mouse was placed in the open field
582 K. WANG ET AL. box, and then activity was recorded using a camera for
10 min. The total distance traveled and the time spent in the
central region were measured to evaluate the motor func-
tioning and anxiety-like behavior of mice.
2.10.2. MWM test
The spatial learning and memory abilities of the mice were
assessed using the MWM test. All MWM data were collected
and analyzed using the Smart 3.0 animal behavior system

DRUG DELIVERY 583 (Panlab, Holliston, MA). The circular maze pool was divided
into four and filled with clear water at 25 ± 2/C14 C. The swim-
ming ability of mice was tested before the training phase,
and a target platform was set up about 1 cm below the sur-
face for the mice to stand on. In the training phase, each
mouse underwent three trials daily for six consecutive days.
In each trial, mice were given 60 s to find the platform. The
time spent to reach the target platform (latency time) was
recorded as one of the indicators of memory/learning indica-
tor. On the seventh day, the platform was removed from the
pool and each mouse was allowed to swim freely for 60 s.
The time spent in the target platform quadrant was calcu-
lated as another indicator of spatial memory.
2.11. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence experiments
were performed as previously described (Wang et al.,2017).
In brief, paraffin-embedded coronal brain sections (10 lm)
from 4 to 5 animals in each group were prepared, with the
operation site near the hippocampus being the main target
sampling area. The sections were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin to assess pathological changes in the brain, and
with the Nissl stain to evaluate the changes in Nissl bodies.
Samples were then observed using a light microscope
(DM4B; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). For immunofluorescence
analysis, the sections were blocked with 5% fetal bovine
serum and then incubated with the appropriate primary anti-
bodies (dilution, 1:100) overnight at 4
/C14 C. The next day, the
sections were washed with PBST and then incubated with
the appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature
for 2 h. Thereafter, the slices were co-incubated with DAPI
solution for 5 min in order to stain the nuclei. Images were
obtained using a fluorescence microscope. At least three
images from four different animals in each group
were analyzed.
2.12. Western blot
For in vitro experiments, proteins were extracted from SH-
SY5Y cells incubated in six-well plates and grouped as
described previously. For in vivo experiments, hippocampi of
three to six mice from each group were homogenized in
RIPA buffer containing 1 mM protease inhibitor cocktail and
PMSF and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. Protein con-
centrations were measured using a BCA protein assay kit.
Proteins were separated on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels
and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The
membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h,
incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4
/C14 C,
washed with TBST buffer, and incubated at room tempera-
ture for 1 h with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
Immunoreactive polypeptides were probed using enhanced
chemiluminescence and the ChemiDoc MP Imaging system
(734BR4330, Bio-Rad, Singapore). Finally, protein band inten-
sities were quantified using the Image Lab software (6.0.0V,
Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
2.13. Statistical analysis
Data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation of at
least three independent experiments. Histograms and line
graphs were analyzed using Prism 5 (GraphPad, San Diego,
CA). For all data, differences were evaluated using one-way
analysis of variance, and post hoc comparisons were per-
formed using Bonferroni ’s correction. Differences p values
<.05 were considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. GO and GO@Dau nanoparticles characterizations
The standard techniques were used to characterize GO and
GO@Dau nanoparticles in this study, including TEM, particle
size distribution, zeta potential, drug loading percentage,
and encapsulation efficiency percentage. Dynamic light scat-
tering analysis confirmed that the average GO particle size
was 158.76 ± 1.99 nm, which increased to 250.91 ± 15.16 nm
after Dau loading (Figure 2(a,b)). Zeta potentials of GO and
GO@Dau nanoparticles were /C0 18.0 ± 0.44 mV and
/C0 19.8 ± 0.72 mV, respectively. Transmission electron micros-
copy images of GO and GO@Dau at 25
/C14 C( Figure 2(c,d))
show that pristine GO had a flaky, paper-like texture,
whereas almost no stacked sheets are observed. The appear-
ance of GO@Dau was basically indistinguishable from that of
GO. GO@Dau nanoparticles were successfully prepared with
a percentage drug entrapment of 73.74 ± 4.91% and percent-
age drug loading of 6.98 ± 1.20%. Thein vitro release proper-
ties of GO@Dau over 48 h were evaluated in a 0.1% Tween
80 PBS solution (pH 7.4) at 37
/C14 C to mimic physiological con-
ditions. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of GO@Dau
showed the characteristic absorption peak of Dau at 298 nm
(Figure 2(e)). As shown inFigure 2(f), rapid drug release was
observed in the initial 12 h period, followed by sustained
release over the next 12 h. At the same time, we carried thio-
flavin (THT) binding assay to detect the aggregation of
b-amyloid peptide. Both GO and GO loaded on Dau effect-
ively inhibited the abnormal aggregation and misfolding of
amyloid (Figure 2(g)).
3.2. GO@Dau had neuroprotective effect on SH-SY5Y
cell induced by Ab1-42 treatment
Based on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of
Dau and the ability of GO to inhibit amyloid aggregation, we
hypothesized that GO@Dau would reverse the nerve cell
apoptosis induced by A b1-42. First, the cytotoxicity of
GO@Dau against SH-SY5Y cells was investigated using the
CCK8 assay. As shown inFigure 3(a), no obvious toxicity was
observed when the concentration of GO@Dau was lower
than 60 lg/mL, confirming the safety threshold of the pre-
pared nanocomposite. In the same way, we determined the
induction concentration of Ab
1-42 (Figure 3(b)) and the opti-
mal protective concentrations of Dau ( Figure 3(c) ) and
GO@Dau against injured cells (Figure 3(d)). Finally, we incu-
bated Dau, GO, and GO@Dau with Ab-induced SH-SY5Y cells
for 48 h. Here, we chose two concentrations of Dau, one is
584 K. WANG ET AL. the optimal therapeutic concentration, and the other is the
amount contained in GO@Dau. The results in Figure 3(e)
show that GO@Dau can better rescue A b1-42-induced
cell damage.
3.3. GO@Dau reduced intracellular ROS accumulation
and reversed MDA and SOD level
The intracellular ROS levels were using DCFH-DA, which fluo-
resces when oxidized by ROS ( Figure 4(a) ). The ROS

other three treatment groups and had statistical significance.
The relative level of MDA and SOD was measured by MDA
and SOD detection kit, respectively. As shown in Figure 4,
the SOD activity was reduced but the MDA level was ele-
vated in the GO@Dau group when compared with the other
treatment group (p<.05).
3.4. GO@Dau reduced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells
Apoptosis was assessed using TUNEL staining. As shown in
Figure 5, there were almost no TUNEL-positive (apoptotic)
cells in the control group, with an significant increase in
TUNEL-positive cells in the model and Dau groups; moreover,
the TUNEL-positive signal decreased in the latter three treat-
ment groups, among which group GO@Dau is the most obvi-
ous. Next, we examined the expression of the pro-apoptosis
proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 as well as the anti-apop-
tosis protein Bcl-2 using western blotting analysis ( Figure
5(c)). Caspase-3 and p53 play important roles in the trans-
duction of apoptosis signals. Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, while
Bax enhances it; both of them are Bcl-2 family proteins and
are important regulators of apoptosis. A decrease in the Bcl-
2/Bax ratio is often used to judge the levels of apoptosis.

586 K. WANG ET AL. GO@Dau could significantly increase Bcl-2 expression and
decreased Bax and caspase-3 expression in A b1-42-induced
SH-SY5Y cells; the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was also increased (Figure
5(d,f)). We also examined the protein level of nuclear Nrf2–
its level in the GO@Dau group increased significantly from
that in the control group (Figure 5(f)). Keap1 level was also
decreased markedly in the GO@Dau group (Figure 5(g)).
3.5. Drug was delivered to the mice brain by intranasal
administration
In vivo imaging data from red fluorescent rhodamine B-
loaded GO showed that it accumulated in the brain after
intranasal administration (Figure 6(a)).
3.6. GO@Dau improved the anxiety-like behavior and
neurocognitive deficits in aggregated Ab1-42-
induced mice
To investigate whether GO@ Dau could alleviate the anxiety-
like behavior and neurocognitive deficits induced by aggre-
gated Ab1-42, OFT and MWM experiments were conducted.
According to the results of the OFT, there was no difference
in the initial total distance traveled among the groups ini-
tially (Figure 1(c)), indicating that mice from all groups had
normal exercise activity and eliminating the possibility of any
surgery-induced motor disturbances. However, compared
with mice injected with saline into the hippocampus, mice
with injected aggregated A b
1-42 had significantly reduced
movement in the central region (Figure 1(d)), whereas the
administration of GO@Dau increased the cumulative time
spent in the central region significantly as compared to that

ter alleviate the anxiety-like behavior of AD mice.
In the MWM task, the swimming speed of the mice was
first assessed, and the experimental data showed that there
were no significant differences between the groups.
Thereafter, we assessed the latency of the mice landing on
the target platform during the training period, as well as the
time spent in the target quadrant and the trajectories of the
mice once the platform was removed after the training. The
results showed that GO@Dau significantly alleviated the cog-
nitive dysfunction induced by aggregated Ab
1-42.
3.7. GO@Dau ameliorated the damage of neurons in
aggregated Ab1-42-induced mice
After the behavioral tests, we examined the neurons in the
brain of the mice using hematoxylin eosin staining and Nissl
body labeling, and observed that GO@Dau had certain neu-
roprotective effects. After induction with aggregated Ab1-42,
the neuronal nuclei were deeply stained ( Figure 7(a)) and
the number of cells (Figure 7(b)) and Nissl bodies was signifi-
cantly reduced. However, GO@Dau reversed these patho-
logical changes and had a better protective effect on the
nerve cells than Dau or GO alone. We also determined the

closely related to neuronal apoptosis, in the brain tissue of
the mice. The results showed that GO@Dau could up-regu-
late the levels of Bcl-2 and BDNF and down-regulate the lev-
els of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax (Figure 7(c)).
3.8. GO@Dau reduced the activation of microglia and
astrocytes in aggregated Ab1-42-induced mice
Subsequently, we also investigated the activation of micro-
glia and astrocytes in the brain to elucidate the mechanism
by which GO@Dau reverses brain injury in aggregated Ab
1-
42-induced mice. Under normal physiological conditions,
microglia are in a resting state and their morphology is
branched. When the central nervous system is damaged,

DRUG DELIVERY 589 microglia are activated and transform into mature immuno-
competent cells that migrate to the injured site. Similarly,
the morphology and biological functions of astrocytes also
change, and benign ‘resting astrocytes’ turn into ‘reactive
astrocytes’ in aggregated Ab
1-42-induced mice. GO@Dau led
to significantly fewer activated microglia and astrocytes in
aggregated Ab
1-42-induced mice than in mice in other treat-
ment groups (Figure 8).
4. Discussion
The aim of this study was to verify the coordinated thera-
peutic effects of GO@Dau nanoparticles in AD models.
Recent years, there are many natural product derived small
molecules and polymer based multi-target therapeutic strat-
egies (Rajasekhar et al., 2018, 2020; Samanta et al., 2019;
Datta et al., 2020). As one of the main pathogenic mecha-
nisms of AD, Ab amyloid precipitation has always been the
focus of AD treatment research (Rajasekhar et al.,2015; Rojo
et al., 2017; Rajasekhar & Govindaraju, 2018). Several in vivo
studies have reported the efficacy of anti-amyloid therapies;
however, single anti-Ab aggregation therapies are often inef-
fective owing to the complexity of the pathogenesis of AD
(Chakraborty et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2017). Thus, it is neces-
sary to develop novel drugs, administration strategies, and
multi-target therapies.
One of the strategies in this study is drug repurposing,
and many scholars have proposed that there is an inverse
relationship between cancer and AD (Pandurangan et al.,
2020; Moorthy & Govindaraju,2021). Hence, we are commit-
ted to explore the anti-cancer drug Dau for its role in AD. In
previous studies, our team found that Dau could regulate
the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway to ameliorate the oxidative stress
induced by Cu
2þ ions or paraquat, and could also alleviate
endoplasmic reticulum stress injury in a nematode model of
AD by activating the IRE-1/XBP-1 and PERK/EIF2 pathways.
GO is a chemical derivative of graphite with unique phys-
ical and chemical properties, such as high stability and spe-
cific surface area and good biocompatibility. It has been
widely used for bioimaging, biosensing, and other biological
and medical applications (Sun et al.,2018; Abbas et al.,2019;
Buskaran et al., 2020), one of which involves leveraging its
various non-covalent interactions to load drugs for use as a
potential drug carrier (Xia et al.,2019; Maciel et al.,2020). In
early studies, it was discovered that the drug-resistance of
breast cancer MCF-7/ADR cells for doxorubicin, a common
antibiotic and antitumor drug, could be reversed through its
p– p stacking and hydrogen bonding adsorption on the GO
surface. Studies have also shown good anti-tumor thera-
peutic efficacies of the anti-HER-2 antibody and miR33a/
miR199 adsorbed on the GO surface (Liu et al., 2018; Xiao
et al., 2019).
The role of GO in the treatment of AD has mostly been
limited to its use as a sensing material for the early diagnosis
of mild cognitive impairment, although a few studies have
investigated its direct pharmacological effects (Zhou et al.,

590 K. WANG ET AL. 2018). Yang et al. simulated and studied the mechanism by
which GO inhibits the aggregation of Ab1-42 and found that
GO could penetrate into Ab fibers and disrupt their structure,
leading to their degradation. Subsequently, Li et al. also con-
firmed that GO could enhance the clearance of amyloid pro-
tein by inducing microglial and neuronal autophagy,
indicating that GO may have the potential for direct applica-
tion in AD therapies (Li et al.,2020).
Therefore, considering the biological properties of GO, the
purpose of this study was to synthesize GO@Dau for AD
therapy use. In this study, GO@Dau nanoparticles were pre-
pared by co-incubating Dau and GO at 37
/C14 C for 48 h. The
drug loading rate was 6.98 ± 1.20%, and the cumulative
release rate reached 13.01%, indicating that, due to the
properties of GO, GO@Dau exhibited a sustained-release
effect. We hypothesize that the methoxy-substituents on the
phenyl ring of Dau form non-covalent bonds with GO for
adsorption. However, the exact nature of the bonds between
Dau and GO still needs to be determined. We had confirmed
that GO@Dau inhibited the aggregation of the Ab peptide
using the ThT fluorescence test (He et al.,2019). In the Ab
1-
42-induced cellular model in this study, it was found that,
compared with Dau or GO alone, GO@Dau significantly
decreased the levels of ROS and MDA in SH-SY5Y cells and
significantly up-regulated the cell survival rate as well as the
levels of SOD and Nrf2/Keap1 pathway-related proteins. In
vivo, GO@Dau effectively improved the cognitive impairment
and pathological damage in AD mice, up-regulated the
expression of BDNF, and inhibited the activation of microglia
and astrocytes induced by Ab
1-42. Based on these results, we
believe that GO@Dau is a drug delivery system worthy of fur-
ther development.
Interestingly, our study also yielded some other intriguing
results. It is well known that intracerebral diseases are diffi-
cult to cure. Besides the complexities of the various patho-
genic mechanisms, the specificity of the physiological
structure of the human brain is also an important obstacle in
the development of various therapeutic drugs. The blood– -
brain barrier is the protective barrier of the central nervous
system; it is composed of vascular endothelial cells, pericytes,
and glial cells and is mainly responsible for material
exchange between the blood and brain tissues (Sarkar et al.,
2017). The blood– brain barrier only allows hydrophobic mol-
ecules with a molecular mass less than 400 to pass; thus,
Scheme 1. Schematic of the composition GO@Dau based on graphene oxide loaded with the neuroprotective agent dauricine. The graphene oxide inhibits abnor-
mal accumulation of amyloid protein in brain, dauricine protects neurons against inflammation and antioxidation, both of them play a role in protecting AD from
brain injury. The present study was carried out in model of AD.
DRUG DELIVERY 591 more than 98% of small molecule drugs cannot pass through
it, creating significant difficulties in the drug development
process (Rohrer et al., 2018). In this study, we found that
GO@Dau cannot penetrate the blood – brain barrier, so we
attempted to administer it nasally (Serralheiro et al., 2014;
Bahman et al., 2019; Espinoza et al.,2019). In order to prove
that nasally administered GO@Dau can enter the brain, we
added rhodamine B to GO as a fluorescent marker. In vivo
imaging results showed that GO@RhB can be effectively
enriched in the brain after nasal administration. Considering
the characteristics of the nasal-brain transmission pathway,
we believe that GO@Dau is internalized by olfactory neurons
through endocytosis or pinocytosis into the olfactory bulb
and then released and distributed to different regions of the
brain. This will be verified in subsequent experiments
(Chalansonnet et al., 2018; Tiozzo Fasiolo et al., 2019); how-
ever, there is no doubt that our results prove that GO-loaded
drugs can enter the brain and function effectively after intra-
nasal administration. In the future, it may also be possible
for drugs like doxorubicin to be carried by GO into the brain
in this manner for the treatment of gliomas or other central
nervous system diseases.
In conclusion, here we describe the successful synthesis of
GO@Dau and its curative effects in models of AD (Scheme 1).
Both in the SH-SY5Y cell model and the Ab1-42-induced AD
mouse model, it was verified that GO-Dau regulated the
Nrf2/Keap1 anti-oxidative pathway and had a better effect
on AD compared with GO or Dau alone. At the same time,
we also found that GO@Dau could enter the brain after nasal
administration in AD mice. Modifying and optimizing the
GO@Dau drug-delivery system would be of great significance
for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies
for AD.

DRUG DELIVERY 593 ","The study describes a novel approach using dauricine, a compound with neuroprotective properties, encapsulated within graphene oxide to target Alzheimer's disease. Dauricine inhibits multifaceted toxicity of amyloid beta (Ab) and has antioxidant effects. Graphene oxide facilitates penetration and extraction of peptides, potentially degrading Ab fibrils. This combination aims to improve delivery across the blood-brain barrier for better therapeutic outcomes in Alzheimer's patients. Key references support dauricine’s role against cancer and neurodegenerative diseases through various mechanisms including PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibition and autophagy-dependent cell death. The study emphasizes the potential of advanced formulations for intranasal delivery to directly target brain tissue, bypassing the blood-brain barrier.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by progressive cognitive and memory-related impairment. However, current therapeutic treatments have not proved sufficiently effective, mainly due to the complicated pathogenesis of the disease. In this study, a nano-formulation of graphene oxide (GO) loaded with dauricine (Dau) was investigated in terms of the combined anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects of Dau and the inhibition of misfolding and aggregation of the amyloid-b (Ab) protein by GO. Both in vivo and in vitro models were induced using Ab1-42, and the formulation was administered nasally in mice. The results showed that GO loaded with Dau greatly reduced oxidative stress through increasing superoxide dismutase levels and decreasing reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levelsin vitro; it also alleviated the cognitive memory deficits and brain glial cell activation in mice with Ab1-42-induced AD. This proved that GO loaded with Dau could protect against Ab1-42-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo AD models; therefore, GO loaded with Dau has the potential to be an effective and agent for the rapid treatment of AD.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It is characterized by progressive development after an insidious onset, and no cure has been developed as yet. Thus, AD remains an enormous financial and social burden for patients and their families due to the terrible and devastating loss of cognition and decline in daily behavior it causes (Uzun et al.,2011; Fransquet et al.,2018). Moreover, the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear, and the simultaneous effects of a variety of causes are believed to be responsible for the onset of the disease. According to the most influential hypothesis of AD pathogenesis, the misfolding of the amyloid-b (Ab) peptide to form toxic oligomers and fibrils in brain tissue is considered as a key factor in AD. The aggregation of neurotoxic Ab leads to increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain, promoting neuronal apoptosis (Butterfield et al., 2013). This eventually results in chronic and irreversible brain tissue damage and multiple neurological impairments, resulting in significant memory deficits and impaired judgment (Butterfield & Boyd-Kimball, 2018; Ziegler-Waldkirch et al.,2018). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel agents for the treatment of AD. Dauricine (Dau) is a dibenzyl tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid extracted and isolated from the rhizome ofMenispermum dauricum. Several studies have shown that Dau exhibited anti-proliferative activity against several different types of malignant cell (Zhang et al., 2018, 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). Dau can regulate the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins through the mitochondrial pathway, inhibit cell apoptosis, and have a protective effect against brain damage (Li & Gong, 2007). Studies have also shown that Dau down-regulated caspase-3, alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress, and had protective effects in a nematode model of AD by stimulating the IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling pathway (Pu et al.,2018); it also had a strong antioxidant effect against acute oxidative damage (Wang et al., 2020). However, the short half-life, rapid metabolism, and certain cytotoxic effects of Dau (Wei et al., 2015; Liu & Liu, 2016) greatly limit its applicability for the treatment of AD. Recently, multifunctional drug-loaded nanosystems have emerged as an effective treatment strategy to treat complex and refractory diseases (Yoon et al., 2015; Jansook et al., 2018; Lv et al.,2018). As the processing product of graphene, graphene oxide (GO) has several advantages over in terms of higher specific surface area, better water solubility and biocompatibility. Polymers and drugs can be linked to GO particles by covalent or non-covalent binding, resulting in high drug loading (Parviz & Strano,2018). Moreover, low concentrations of GO could degrade the Ab protein and reduce Ab-induced cell apoptosis (Yang et al.,2015). Thus, drug delivery systems based on GO have the potential to be used as multi-targeted and more efficient therapeutic strategies for AD. However, in the clinical setting, the most difficult problem in the treatment of AD is the unique blood – brain and blood– cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the central nervous system, which intercept toxic and macromolecular substances, but also block therapeutic drugs. This is also the main reason for the poor therapeutic efficacy and peripheral adverse reactions of AD drugs (Henrich-Noack et al.,2019; Langen et al., 2019). Therefore, intranasal administration, which enables noninvasive delivery from the nose to the brain, was used in animal experiments in this study – the drug is introduced from the nose into the cerebrospinal fluid, and then into the extracellular fluid of brain tissue after passing through the blood– brain barrier. The success of several nasal drugs on the market is indicative of the potential advantages over traditional administration routes (Kamei et al., 2018;L i et al., 2019). In the present study, we investigated GO nanoparticles loaded with Dau (hereafter referred to as GO@Dau) as a novel therapeutic drug for AD and compared itsin vivo and in vitro neuroprotective effects on A b1-42-induced AD with those of GO or Dau alone.","The standard techniques were used to characterize GO and GO@Dau nanoparticles in this study, including TEM, particle size distribution, zeta potential, drug loading percentage, and encapsulation efficiency percentage. Dynamic light scattering analysis confirmed that the average GO particle size was 158.76 ± 1.99 nm, which increased to 250.91 ± 15.16 nm after Dau loading (Figure 2(a,b)). Zeta potentials of GO and GO@Dau nanoparticles were /C0 18.0 ± 0.44 mV and /C0 19.8 ± 0.72 mV, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy images of GO and GO@Dau at 25/C14 C( Figure 2(c,d)) show that pristine GO had a flaky, paper-like texture, whereas almost no stacked sheets are observed. The appearance of GO@Dau was basically indistinguishable from that of GO. GO@Dau nanoparticles were successfully prepared with a percentage drug entrapment of 73.74 ± 4.91% and percentage drug loading of 6.98 ± 1.20%. Thein vitro release properties of GO@Dau over 48 h were evaluated in a 0.1% Tween 80 PBS solution (pH 7.4) at 37/C14 C to mimic physiological conditions. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of GO@Dau showed the characteristic absorption peak of Dau at 298 nm (Figure 2(e)). As shown inFigure 2(f), rapid drug release was observed in the initial 12 h period, followed by sustained release over the next 12 h. At the same time, we carried thioflavin (THT) binding assay to detect the aggregation of b-amyloid peptide. Both GO and GO loaded on Dau effectively inhibited the abnormal aggregation and misfolding of amyloid (Figure 2(g)). Based on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of Dau and the ability of GO to inhibit amyloid aggregation, we hypothesized that GO@Dau would reverse the nerve cell apoptosis induced by A b1-42. First, the cytotoxicity of GO@Dau against SH-SY5Y cells was investigated using the CCK8 assay. As shown inFigure 3(a), no obvious toxicity was observed when the concentration of GO@Dau was lower than 60 lg/mL, confirming the safety threshold of the prepared nanocomposite. In the same way, we determined the induction concentration of Ab1-42 (Figure 3(b)) and the optimal protective concentrations of Dau ( Figure 3(c) ) and GO@Dau against injured cells (Figure 3(d)). Finally, we incubated Dau, GO, and GO@Dau with Ab-induced SH-SY5Y cells for 48 h. Here, we chose two concentrations of Dau, one is the optimal therapeutic concentration, and the other is the amount contained in GO@Dau. The results in Figure 3(e) show that GO@Dau can better rescue A b1-42-induced cell damage. The intracellular ROS levels were using DCFH-DA, which fluoresces when oxidized by ROS ( Figure 4(a) ). The ROS fluorescence of GO@Dau group was obvious lower than the other three treatment groups and had statistical significance. The relative level of MDA and SOD was measured by MDA and SOD detection kit, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, the SOD activity was reduced but the MDA level was elevated in the GO@Dau group when compared with the other treatment group (p<.05). Apoptosis was assessed using TUNEL staining. As shown in Figure 5, there were almost no TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells in the control group, with an significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells in the model and Dau groups; moreover, the TUNEL-positive signal decreased in the latter three treatment groups, among which group GO@Dau is the most obvious. Next, we examined the expression of the pro-apoptosis proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3 as well as the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 using western blotting analysis ( Figure 5(c)). Caspase-3 and p53 play important roles in the transduction of apoptosis signals. Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, while Bax enhances it; both of them are Bcl-2 family proteins and are important regulators of apoptosis. A decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio is often used to judge the levels of apoptosis. GO@Dau could significantly increase Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax and caspase-3 expression in A b1-42-induced SH-SY5Y cells; the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was also increased (Figure 5(d,f)). We also examined the protein level of nuclear Nrf2– its level in the GO@Dau group increased significantly from that in the control group (Figure 5(f)). Keap1 level was also decreased markedly in the GO@Dau group (Figure 5(g)). In vivo imaging data from red fluorescent rhodamine B-loaded GO showed that it accumulated in the brain after intranasal administration (Figure 6(a)). To investigate whether GO@ Dau could alleviate the anxiety-like behavior and neurocognitive deficits induced by aggregated Ab1-42, OFT and MWM experiments were conducted. According to the results of the OFT, there was no difference in the initial total distance traveled among the groups initially (Figure 1(c)), indicating that mice from all groups had normal exercise activity and eliminating the possibility of any surgery-induced motor disturbances. However, compared with mice injected with saline into the hippocampus, mice with injected aggregated A b1-42 had significantly reduced movement in the central region (Figure 1(d)), whereas the administration of GO@Dau increased the cumulative time spent in the central region significantly as compared to that in the other administration groups. Thus, GO@Dau could better alleviate the anxiety-like behavior of AD mice. In the MWM task, the swimming speed of the mice was first assessed, and the experimental data showed that there were no significant differences between the groups. Thereafter, we assessed the latency of the mice landing on the target platform during the training period, as well as the time spent in the target quadrant and the trajectories of the mice once the platform was removed after the training. The results showed that GO@Dau significantly alleviated the cognitive dysfunction induced by aggregated Ab1-42. After the behavioral tests, we examined the neurons in the brain of the mice using hematoxylin eosin staining and Nissl body labeling, and observed that GO@Dau had certain neuroprotective effects. After induction with aggregated Ab1-42, the neuronal nuclei were deeply stained ( Figure 7(a)) and the number of cells (Figure 7(b)) and Nissl bodies was significantly reduced. However, GO@Dau reversed these pathological changes and had a better protective effect on the nerve cells than Dau or GO alone. We also determined the levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and BDNF, which are closely related to neuronal apoptosis, in the brain tissue of the mice. The results showed that GO@Dau could up-regulate the levels of Bcl-2 and BDNF and down-regulate the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax (Figure 7(c)). Subsequently, we also investigated the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brain to elucidate the mechanism by which GO@Dau reverses brain injury in aggregated Ab1-42-induced mice. Under normal physiological conditions, microglia are in a resting state and their morphology is branched. When the central nervous system is damaged, microglia are activated and transform into mature immunocompetent cells that migrate to the injured site. Similarly, the morphology and biological functions of astrocytes also change, and benign ‘resting astrocytes’ turn into ‘reactive astrocytes’ in aggregated Ab1-42-induced mice. GO@Dau led to significantly fewer activated microglia and astrocytes in aggregated Ab1-42-induced mice than in mice in other treatment groups (Figure 8)."

abstract
Transthyretin (TTR) has a well-established role in neuroprotection in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We have
setup a drug discovery program of small-molecule compounds that act as chaperones enhancing TTR/
Amyloid-beta peptide (A
b) interactions. A combination of computational drug repurposing approaches
and in vitrobiological assays have resulted in a set of molecules which were then screened with our in-
house validated high-throughput screening ternary test. A prioritized list of chaperones was obtained
and corroborated with ITC studies. Small-molecule chaperones have been discovered, among them our
lead compound Iododiﬂunisal (IDIF), a molecule in the discovery phase; one investigational drug
(luteolin); and 3 marketed drugs (sulindac, olsalazine andﬂufenamic), which could be directly repur-
posed or repositioned for clinical use. Not all TTR tetramer stabilizers behave as chaperonesin vitro.
These chemically diverse chaperones will be used for validating TTR as a targetin vivo, and to select one
repurposed drug as a candidate to enter clinical trials as AD disease-modifying drug.

European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 226 (2021) 113847 1. Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disease and is the leading cause of dementia. AD is characterized by
accumulation of amyloid-b (Ab) aggregates in various conforma-
tions, ﬁlamentous intraneuronal inclusions mainly constituted by
hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (p-Tau), and synaptic dysfunction
and neuronal loss [1].
One of the most difﬁcult challenges in AD research is toﬁnd a
disease modifying therapy (DMT), this is, a therapy with an agent
that produces an enduring change in the clinical progression of AD,
by changing the biology of AD and producing neuroprotection by
interfering in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the
disease process that lead to cell death (often through a variety of
intermediate mechanisms such as effects on amyloid or tau) [2].
The ﬁve drugs available in the market for AD are involved in only
improving symptoms and are highly patient dependent. Aduhelm
(aducanumab) [3,4], by Biogen and Eisai, an antibody that targets
amyloid-beta, was approved in June 2021 by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) under its accelerated approval pathway. FDA
approval of Aduhelm, the ﬁrst drug with a putative disease-
modifying mechanism for AD treatment, has been met with a fair
degree of skepticism and controversy [5,6]. No other putative dis-
ease modifying drugs or new symptomatic treatments for AD have
achieved regulatory approval since 2003 [7]. There are 126 agents
in the current AD treatment pipeline, 28 of them in phase III, 74 in
phase II and 24 in phase I clinical trials. The majority of drugs in
trials (82.5%) target the underlying biology of AD with the intent of
disease modiﬁcation [8].
AD drug development is not delivering new drugs in the last
decades. Among the many explanations for such failure, one is the
lack of new chemical entities from drug discovery approaches that
reach the clinical phase I level [9e12]. There is an urgent need to
ﬁnd a treatment that prevents, delays the onset or slows the pro-
gression of this devastating disease.
With the aim of contributing with new candidate drugs that,
after preclinical tests, may feed the currently exhausted pipeline of
drugs in phase I for AD, we have settled a drug discovery program
targeting transthyretin (TTR) and searching for small-molecule
chaperones that may improve the neuroprotective function of
TTR in AD.
Transthyretin (TTR), a homotetrameric protein mainly synthe-
sized by the liver and the choroid plexus (CP), and secreted into the
blood and the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), respectively, has been
specially recognised for its functions as a transporter protein of
thyroxine (T4) and retinol [13]. The importance of TTR has also been
robustly established in AD pathogenesis [14]. It is most remarkable
that TTR is the main Ab binding protein in the CSF.[15-17] This
binding is believed to naturally prevent Ab aggregation and toxicity
in this media. Comparative analysis of TTR evidenced decreased
levels of this protein, not only in the CSF [18,19] but also in plasma
[20e22] of AD patients, compared to controls. AD TTR-hemizygous
mice showed increased Ab production and deposition, compared to
AD TTR WT littermates [23], whereas overexpressing human TTR
WT in an AD mouse model decreased neuropathology and Ab
deposition [24]. Regarding the mechanisms proposed as underlying
TTR neuroprotection in AD,ex vivoand in vitrostudies, established
that TTR has the ability to bind to Ab, avoiding its aggregation and
toxicity [25e30]. Recent reports suggest that TTR binds to Ab
oligomers and inhibits primary and secondary nucleation processes
[29,30]. TTR was also shown to assist Ab brain efﬂux through the
blood-brain barrier, and to promote its degradation in the liver.
Results also revealed that TTR regulates the expression of LRP1, by
increasing its levels, both in the brain and in the liver [31]. Recent
data implicated TTR reduction in the thickening of the basement
membrane of brain microvessels in AD mice,[32] an alteration that
also occurs in the AD brain [33].
TTR tetrameric stability appears as a key factor in its interaction
with Ab peptide. Interestingly, TTR stability is also a key factor in
Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) [ 34,35] a systemic
amyloidosis with a special involvement of the peripheral nerve
system, which results from the aggregation, deposition and toxicity
of mutated TTR. Since it is believed that tetramer dissociation into
monomers is theﬁrst step leading to TTR amyloid formation [36],
TTR tetrameric stabilization has been deﬁned as the basis for one of
the possible therapeutic strategies in FAP [37e39]. Such stabiliza-
tion can be achieved through the use of small compounds sharing
molecular structural similarities with thyroxine (T4) which bind in
the T4 central binding channel [40,41]. The search for TTR stabi-
lizing ligands using virtual screening and computational proced-
ures has been carried out previously [42e44] and there is a large
number of TTR and TTR-ligand three dimensional structures re-
ported at the PDB [45]. These computational and structural studies
have been instrumental in the design, discovery and development
of TTR stabilizing compounds that have either reached the market,
like Tafamidis [46,47], or that have reached clinical phases, like
Tolcapone, a repurposed drug approved for the treatment of Par-
kinson's disease (Fig. 1)[ 48].
We have demonstrated by earlyin vitrostudies that TTR and Ab
bind together and that this interaction can be enhanced by a small
set of TTR tetramer-stabilizing compounds [ 49], one of them
Iododiﬂunisal (IDIF), a iodinated analog of the NSAID diﬂunisal
(DIF) (Fig. 1)[ 50e52]. More importantly,in vivoadministration of
IDIF to a mouse model of AD, resulted in decreased brain Ab levels
and deposition [53,54], and improving the cognitive functions that
are impaired in this AD-like neuropathology [53].
Drug repurposing of already known drugs for new indications is
a drug discovery approach increasingly being used to search for
new therapies for diseases with unmet clinical needs. Bothin silico
[55,56] and experimental [57] approaches on drug repurposing
have been recently reviewed, as well as the application of this
approach to drug discovery for AD [58-60]. Furthermore, another
interesting strategy in drug discovery is the multi-target approach,
which aims to have a synergistic effect thanks to the interaction of a
given ligand with different targets that are involved in a disease's
pathway. Therefore, these synergies through target promiscuity
could be translated into lower doses and reduced side effects
[61,62].
In this paper, we report the discovery of TTR stabilizers through
two complementaryin silicodrug repurposing approaches, as well
as the systematic biological evaluation of the selected compounds
on TTR stability, through competition with T4 for TTR binding, and
by measuring the amount of monomers. This process has led to the
prioritization of a set of 53 TTR tetramer stabilizing compounds and
to an analysis of their ability to enhance the TTR/Ab interaction.
Using our in-house validated high-throughput screening (HTS)
ternary assay [28], we have evaluated these 53 small-molecule
compounds and have obtained a subset of small molecule chaper-
ones (SMCs), among them our lead compound IDIF, one clinical
phase compound (luteolin), and three approved drugs for other
diseases (sulindac, olsalazine andﬂufenamic acid), that could enter
clinical trials for AD as repurposed drugs.
2. Results and discussion
Computational studies. In order toﬁnd small molecule chap-
erones that enhance the TTR/Ab interaction, two computational
pipelines have been established, addressing drug repurposing and
polypharmacology, as shown inFig. 2. The ﬁrst approach started
with the construction of a TTR/Ab model [63] as described in the
E.Y. Cotrina, L.M. Santos, J. Rivas et al. European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 226 (2021) 113847
2 Experimental Section. Then, compounds from the Integrity data-
base ( https://integrity.clarivate.com/integrity/xmlxsl/) and from
the literature were selected, so as they were either (i) known TTR
binders, (ii) amyloid peptide binding ligands, or (iii) both, or (iv)
compounds under study in clinical phases for the treatment of
Alzheimer's disease. The use of the CARLSBAD software and data-
base [64] allowed us to ﬁnd privileged scaffolds with reported
biological activity against both TTR and A
b systems. This scaffold
hunting methodology allowed us toﬁnd a group of compounds
containing the stilbene substructure and able to interact with both
entities (TTR and Ab). Then, this stilbene scaffold was used to select
molecules by substructure search in the Integrity-derived and
literature-derived databases already mentioned, and the selected
compounds were then prioritized by docking into our TTR/Ab
model [63]. In total, 48 compounds with docking scores similar to
IDIF (used as the cross-reference compound in the docking exper-
iments) were prioritized, and 20 of them, that were commercially
available, were selected and acquired to carry out the experimental
assays.
A second computational approach was carried out in order to
exploit the drug-promiscuity and polypharmacology in a
multitarget-based pipeline. This methodology allowed us to iden-
tify molecules able to bind TTR that also bind additional targets that
have been associated with the treatment of AD and that are rele-
vant in its pathological pathways. As described in the Experimental
section, this strategy includes multi-target molecular docking and
molecular searches through common pharmacophore models to a
set of targets (Fig. 2B). Starting from the Integrity database (https://
integrity.clarivate.com/integrity/xmlxsl/), which contains small
molecules and drugs in the market or advanced clinical phases, we
selected nearly 1400 compounds that were reported in preclinical,
clinical or marketed phase and that had their protein target re-
ported as one or more of the following, which have been associated
to AD: APP (amyloid precursor protein); AchE (acetylcholines-
terase); IL-10 (interleukin-10);a-, b- andg-secretases; Tau protein;
GABA and glutamate receptors. All these compounds were then
docked into the TTR model, prioritizing a pool of 134 molecules that
would theoretically bind the TTR T4-channel with an afﬁnity similar
to IDIF. These molecules were then analyzed theoretically through
cross-docking into the following protein structures: IL-10 (Inter-
leukin-10) (PDB code 1ILK); inhibitor domain of APP (amyloid beta-
protein precursor) (PDB code 1AAP);
b-secretase (memapsin 2)
complexed with inhibitor OM99-2 (PDB code 1FKN); human
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) complexed with fasciculin-II (PDB code
1B41); metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 with LY341495 antago-
nist (PDB code 3KS9); metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 with
glutamate (PDB code 3LMK). All these docking experiments lead to
a prioritized list of 85 molecules, which wereﬁltered to 27 mole-
cules that would theoretically bind to TTR/Ab complex (by docking
experiments) and 4 additional AD related targets (multi-target
docking approach for ligand selection). In addition, the 134 mole-
cules that were selected before through docking with TTR were
further analyzed computationally through the software
LigandScout [65]. A common pharmacophore was built starting
from the binding sites of TTR,b-secretase, metabotropic glutamate
receptor 1 and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, and then the
134 molecules were screened against this pharmacophore; 13 of
them coincided with the list of 27 molecules derived from the
multi-target docking, but we were able to select 4 additional
molecules that matched with the common pharmacophore. The
Table S1 in the Supporting Information contains all the chemical
structures of the compounds that were selected through these
computational procedures, as well as other molecules (that had
been reported as TTR ligands, in the literature, and from previous
studies in our laboratory), which were also selected after docking
them into our TTR/A
b model, and the results of the associated
experimental assays for all the selected molecules, which are
described hereunder.
Thyroxine binding assays and TTR stability assays.To conﬁrm
the ability of the proposed compounds to bind TTR we designed a
ﬂow chart through which all the selected compounds were
experimentally assayed (Fig. 3).
The ﬁrst assay, to which all compounds were submitted, was a
T4 displacement assay [48,50]. In brief, radiolabeled [125I]-T4 was
incubated alone or in the presence of each of the compounds with
TTR, and then samples were run in a native PAGE gel. Compounds
that are able to bind to TTR in the T4 central binding channel, and
thus to displace [125I]-T4, result in decreased intensity of the [125I]-
T4/TTR band. When using plasma as a source of TTR, which is the
case of the present work, this approach also enables the visuali-
zation of the bands corresponding to the other T4 transporter
proteins, such as thyroxineebinding globulin (TBG) and albumin.
IDIF was used as a reference compound (see representative
example in Fig. 3A). This assay, although not quantitative, is of
utmost importance, in particular when using human plasma, since
it also reveals the effect of the compounds in the other referred T4
transporter proteins, and therefore, on their speciﬁcity for TTR
binding. Using this approach, we characterized the behavior of the
compounds regarding their ability to displace T4 and their speci-
ﬁcity for TTR binding (seeTable S1in the Supporting Information
for a complete view of the behavior of all compounds in the qual-
itative T4 displacement assay).
In addition to high afﬁnity for TTR, compounds should also be
speciﬁc for this protein, since lack of speciﬁcity, together with the
high abundance of other plasma proteins, such as albumin, for
instance, could lead to failure in therapeutics. However, at this stage
of our selection, we mainly aimed at identifying strong TTR stabi-
lizers which will be further investigated for their capacity to
enhance the TTR/Ab interaction. Thus, at this point all compounds
that completely or signi ﬁcantly displaced T 4 from TTR, were
selected for the quantitative assay regardless of their speciﬁcity
(Table S1). Selected compounds were then evaluated in a quanti-
tative T4 assay to determine their EC50 and values were compared
to the EC50 of T4 (a representative example is given inFig. 3B, re-
sults in Table S2). Analysis of results enabled us to conclude that
only compounds that showed complete T4 displacement in the
Fig. 1. Chemical structures of TTR tetramer stabilizers: the orphan drug Tafamidis, the Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID) diﬂunisal (DIF), the repurposed drug Tol-
capone for Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and our lead compound Iododiﬂunisal (IDIF).

3 qualitative assay, produced EC50 T4/EC50 compound ratios higher
than 1,i.e., with afﬁnity to TTR higher than the one of T4. Never-
theless, a ratio of EC50 T4/EC50 compound of 0.5 or superior was
used to identify a pool of compounds able to bind TTR efﬁciently
and therefore those that should be tested in our proprietary HTS
ternary assay [28]. In some instances, compounds revealed a non-
standard or ambiguous behavior, hindering the statistical analysis
performed for the rest of the compounds.
Nonetheless, and in order to avoid elimination of compounds
that could stabilize TTR by pathways other than binding to the T4
binding site, all of the non-selected compounds were assessed in a
TTR stability assay [66]. This approach was employed to test and to
evaluate the ability of the non-selected compounds to stabilize TTR,
by electrophoretic means, under semi-denaturing conditions, as
described in the Experimental section. As readout, we assessed the
levels of monomeric TTR upon incubation with each compound and
values were compared to those obtained in the absence of
compound.
Fig. 3C displays representative results obtained in this stability
assay showing different levels of the TTR monomer. The graphic
represents the intensity of the monomer band, considering the
value of 1 for the control. Compounds that reduced the intensity of
the monomer band to at least half of the intensity in the control,
were considered for theﬁnal list of the compounds to enter a future
ternary assay (Table S1).
Altogether, compounds selected from the T
4 quantitative and
the TTR stability assays constitute a subset of 53 molecules
amenable to be screened using our proprietary HTS ternary assay
(Table S4in the Supporting Information).
Crystal structures of TTR:ligand complexes.From thisﬁnal list
of compounds to enter a future ternary assay, two compounds,35
and 73, were selected for the structure elucidation of the TTR
complexes by X-ray diffraction, because their TTR-ligand structures
have not been previously analyzed (Table S3in Supporting Infor-
mation). Both compounds bind in the so-called thyroxine binding
sites (Fig. 4). Compound 35 (Fig. 4, left panel) binds very deeply
with the iodinated ring located at the outmost part of the T4
channel. This binding induces the rotation of Ser117 side chains of
the four monomers creating new strong intermonomer hydrogen
bonds between these residues. The Lys15 residues, located at the
entrance of the binding sites, establish interactions with the
carboxylate substituents of the ligand. Compound73 does not bind
so deeply in the channel as35 (Fig. 4, right panel) and, conse-
quently, it does not induce the formation of such strong in-
teractions between the Ser117 residues of the TTR tetramer. The
Lys15 residues, in the TTR:73 complex, are not pointing to the
center of the channel and are not involved in interactions with the
compound.
Selection of small-molecule chaperones (SMCs): HTS ternary
assay, ITC studies and ThT assays.To efﬁciently screen for potential
small-molecule chaperones of the TTR/A
b interaction, we have
used our recently in house developed and validated high-
throughput assay that relies on the ability of the test compounds
to prevent A
b aggregation in solutions of preformed TTR/A b

4 complexes [28]. The assay makes use of Ab(12e28) which has
analogous properties as full length A b peptides but is a less
expensive and more stable peptide. Thus, the recombinant wtTTR is
incubated with the test compound (ratio TTR/compound 1:2) dur-
ing 1 h and then, Ab(12e28) is added to the complex and UV
monitoring of turbidity for 6 h allows to determine its potency. A
complete high-throughput screening in this ternary assay was
carried out for all the 53 compounds previously selected from
computational and biological studies (seeFig. S1and Table S5in the
Supporting Information).
After classifying the compounds according to their potency at
reducing Ab aggregation a prioritized list was obtained (SeeFig. 5).
In this list we found our lead compound IDIF, the natural product
luteolin (LUT), a compound in clinical phases, and three registered
drugs, olsalazine (OLS), sulindac (SUL) andﬂufenamic acid (FLU),
among others (SeeFig. 5C).
Furthermore, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) technique
has been used to corroborate the chaperoning effect ofﬁve of the
best small-molecule compounds as described previously [27]. Thus,
we have compared the binding in the Ab(12e28)/TTR/SMC ternary
complexes with the binary interaction Ab(12e28)/TTR (Figs. S12
and S13 at the Supporting Information). In addition, a full ther-
modynamic characterization of the ternary complexes with
Ab(1e40) and TTR and each of theﬁve best selected SMCs was
obtained (Fig. 6). The binary TTR/Ab(1e40) (1:1) complex forma-
tion shows a dissociation constant of Kd¼ 6.49 mM. However, IDIF
enhances this interaction between TTR and Ab(1e40), since the Kd
is reduced to 3.34mM when TTR in the presence of IDIF is titrated

5 with Ab(1e40). Similar improvements were observed for the
ternary complexes with the best SMCs (i.e.K d ¼ 1.52 mM (LUT);
3.42 mM (SUL); 0.81mM (OLS) and 2.34mM (FLU)).
To complement the results gathered so far, we performed the
aggregation kinetics of A b(1e42) in the presence of the ﬁve
selected SMCs using by ThT assays, obtaining coherent results with
the turbidity measurements observed with A
b(12e28) (Fig. 7).
Interestingly, none of the best small molecule chaperones inter-
fered with the aggregation kinetics of Ab(1e42) (Figs. S2eS11).
Additionally, we have performed dose-response studies on the bi-
nary interaction TTR/Ab (Fig. 7B) and in the ternary interaction
when TTR is complexed with IDIF (Fig. 7C). As shown inFig. 7C the
aggregation kinetics of Ab(1e42) in the presence of TTR complexed
with IDIF are concentration dependent of this small-compound.
Mounting evidence has demonstrated that Ab peptides and
their oligomeric forms are toxic to neural cells leading to apoptosis
and cellular death. It is also well established that TTR protects
against this neurotoxicity [ 25,29,30]. To evaluate A b-induced
neuronal apoptosis in the presence of TTR stabilized by the selected
SMCs, we evaluated caspase 3 activation in SH-SY5Y cells. We
conﬁrmed that TTR prevented the noxious effect of A b(1e42)
peptide, reducing signiﬁcantly the levels of caspase-3 activation, as
compared to those produced by the oligomers. Also, as we previ-
ously reported [28], TTR stabilized by IDIF was even more potent at
protecting against Ab toxicity, as caspase 3 levels were signiﬁcantly
reduced when compared to those generated in cells treated with
Ab(1e42) co-incubated with TTR (without IDIF). Importantly, the
effect ofﬂufenamic acid (FLU), olsalazine (OLS), and luteolin (LUT)
was found to be similar to that of IDIF. Sulindac (SUL), while pro-
moting the protection conferred by TTR, was not as strong as the
other tested compounds (Supporting Information,Fig. S14).
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one of the bottlenecks in brain
drug development and is the single most important factor limiting
the future growth of neurotherapeutics [67]. In our previous papers
we have shown that BBB penetration is facilitated by the binding of
IDIF to TTR [53,54,68]. Importantly, the BBB penetration ability of
some of our selected compounds has been previously reported in
the literature [69e71]. Here, we have also analyzedin silico the
molecular properties of the 5 selected compounds, and results
predict that they cross the BBB (See Supporting Information)
[72,73].
Altogether, these results conﬁrm that TTR is a neuroprotective
protein, preventing Ab toxicity, and that TTR performance can be
enhanced by small-molecule chaperones of the TTR/Ab interaction,
prompting TTR stabilization as a promising therapeutic strategy in
AD.
3. Conclusions
In this paper, we haveﬁrst taken a combined computational/
experimental approach to select a pool of chemically diverse
compounds, that may enhance the ability of TTR to sequester the A
b
peptide. In order to carry out this comprehensive study, two
complementary computational procedures were used: a) drug
repurposing through virtual screening and pharmacophore
searches, starting form a large set of compounds that have either
reached the market or are in clinical phases, and docking them into
our built TTR/A
b molecular model; and b) a multi-target approach,
where we selected molecules that were theoretically interacting
with our built TTR/Ab molecular model, but also would theoreti-
cally interact with a group of four protein targets that have been
associated with AD.
All of the selected compounds that underwent these computa-
tional procedures, and other known TTR ligands, were sequentially
assayed in a screening cascade covering TTR binding through both a
T4 displacement assay (qualitative) and a TTRe T4 competition
assay (quantitative), followed by a TTR stabilizing assay.
The combined virtual and experimental screening approach has
led to 53 highly diverse compounds that strongly stabilize TTR.
Among these compounds, compound 35 and the drug olsalazine
had not been previously described as TTR stabilizers and may be
relevant for TTR-related therapies.
Of note, these 53 compounds were good candidates for the
analysis of the modulation of the TTR/Ab interactions, and they
were analyzed through our robust HTS ternary assay. The results of
this ternary assay show a prioritized list of small molecule chap-
erones (SMCs) of the TTR/Ab interaction providing the basis for a
novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the

6 SMCs, we have found small-molecules as our lead small-molecule
compound IDIF which is one of the best SMCs, and also three
marketed drugs (olsalazine, sulindac, andﬂufenamic acid) and one
investigational drug (luteolin), which could be directly repurposed
or repositioned for clinical use. The orphan drug Tafamidis and the
repurposed Parkinson's drug Tolcapone have been reported to be
excellent TTR tetramer stabilisers, but these drugs have no
chaperoning effect in ourin vitroassays, showing that not all good
TTR tetramer kinetic stabilisers are good SMCs.
Our drug discovery program offers the possibility to explore the
chemical space by HTS of commercially available libraries of drugs/
compounds toﬁnd new SMCs. Further work will be carried out to

7 explore the activity of some chemical scaffolds such as the biphenyl
one present in IDIF, so as to build structure-activity relationships
from the HTS ternary assay results. In particular, the SMC IDIF will
be optimized for ADME properties and to improve blood-brain
barrier (BBB) passage.
A small set of these SMCs will be prioritized to enter preclinical
safety studies, analyzing theirin vivobehavior, in order to select one
repurposed drug as a candidate to enter clinical trials for AD.
These selected small-molecule chaperones provide the basis for
a novel target for Alzheimer's disease, based on targeting trans-
thyretin. We envisage that this new target will feed the currently
exhausted pipeline of drugs in phase I for AD with the goal of
increasing AD disease-modifying therapies. In addition, the three
marketed drugs reported in this work as SMCs of the TTR/Ab
interaction (sulindac, olsalazine andﬂufenamic acid) could directly
enter a clinical phase program as candidate AD therapies, as an
example of drug repurposing.
4. Material and methods
General procedure for molecular models preparation .A
molecular model of TTR was generated using the three-
dimensional coordinates of the TTR protein structure (PDB code
1DVQ), available at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (www.rcsb.org).
For hydrogen atoms reﬁnement and energy minimization, the
Protonate 3D package implemented in MOE 2015.10 was employed
to add hydrogen atoms to TTR which were further submitted to an
energy-minimization process [74]. Partial charges were obtained by
computing the electrostatic potentials in the optimized structures.
The energy minimization step was carried out using a distance-
dependent dielectric constant and a cut-off distance of 10 Å for
the van der Waals interactions. In theﬁnal step, the reﬁnement was
accomplished using 1000 cycles of steepest descents followed by
conjugate gradients until the maximum gradient of the energy was
smaller than 0.05 kcal/mol Å2.
The same procedure and parameters were used to compute the
following proteins used in this work: IL-10 (interleukin-10) (PDB
code 1ILK); inhibitor domain of APP (amyloid beta-protein pre-
cursor) (PDB code 1AAP);b secretase with inhibitor OM99-2 (PDB
code 1FKN); human acetylcholinesterase with Fasciculin-II (PDB
code 1B41); metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 with LY341495
antagonist (PDB code 3KS9); metabotropic glutamate receptor 5
with glutamate (PDB code 3LMK).
Docking experiments (TTR/Ab computational model) pro-
cedure. The MOE 2015.10 package [74] was used to perform the
docking studies between the reﬁned TTR X-Ray crystallographic
structure (as template) and Ab peptide (as ligand). Alpha Triangle
was used as placement method; Alpha HB as score function, and

8 AMBER10 as force-ﬁeld [75] in the ﬁrst reﬁnement step of the
docking solutions. A rescoring step was also implemented in this
computational pipeline, using London DG as function score, and
again AMBER10 as forceﬁeld for the last reﬁnement step of this
docking study.
Docking experiments (virtual screening) general procedure.
The MOE 2015.10 package was used to perform the docking studies
between the reﬁned TTR protein: Ab peptide system. Molecules
computed as ligand for the docking experiments were pretreated
using the LygX application from the software package MOE. After
that the experiment were performed as follows: Alpha Triangle was
used as placement method; Alpha HB as score function, and
MMFF94x as forceﬁeld in theﬁrst reﬁnement step of the docking
solutions. A rescoring step was also implemented in this compu-
tational pipeline, using London DG as function score, and again
MMFF94x as forceﬁeld for the last reﬁnement step.
Pharmacophore set-up.The LigandScout 3.0 software package
[65] was used to build-up a pharmacophore starting from the
binding sites of TTR protein (T 4 binding pocket), b-secretase,
metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 and metabotropic glutamate
receptor 5. The pharmacophore resulting from this
pocket alignment process was used to screen a set of molecules
coming from the second pipeline explained in the next section.
Selection pipeline of ligands.Two complementary approaches
were carried out to select the ligands to be docked in the TTR
molecular model:
Pipeline A: starting from the Integrity database ( https://
integrity.clarivate.com/integrity/xmlxsl/), which contains small
molecules and drugs in the market or advanced clinical phases,
nearly 3200 compounds were selected and sorted according to
which protein or disease was their main target: Amyloid peptide,
transthyretin, both or Alzheimer's disease in general. In addition,
nearly 500 compounds were also added to this list that have been
gathered from the literature or that had been previously explored
in our laboratories, as potential TTR stabilizers.
Then the CARLSBAD database and software [64], which contains
integrated data on compounds and their target binding afﬁnities,
were used to select compounds that had experimentally shown af-
ﬁnity vs. both TTR and the amyloid peptide. This lead to a common
stilbene substructure scaffold that was then used to carry out a sub-
structure search among the original selection of nearly 3700 com-
pounds. The resulting 48 compounds with the stilbene substructure
were then docked into our TTR:A
b computational model [63].
Pipeline B: starting from the Integrity database (https://integrity.
clarivate.com/integrity/xmlxsl/), which contains small molecules
and drugs in the market or in advanced clinical phases, we selected
nearly 1400 compounds that were reported in preclinical, clinical or
marketed phase and that had their protein target reported as one or
more of the following, which have been associated to AD: APP
(amyloid precursor protein); AchE (acetylcholinesterase); IL-10
(interleukin-10); a-, b-a n dg-secretases; tau protein; GABA and
glutamate receptors. All these compounds were then docked into the
TTR model, prioritizing a pool of 134 molecules that would theo-
retically bind the TTR T4 channel with an afﬁnity similar to IDIF.
These molecules were then virtually analyzed through docking with
software MOE 2015.10 into the following protein structures: IL-10
(interleukin-10); inhibitor domain of APP (amyloid beta-protein
precursor);
b-secretase with inhibitor OM99-2; acetylcholines-
terase (AchE) with Fasciculin-II; metabotropic glutamate receptor 1
with LY341495 antagonist; metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 with
glutamate. All these docking processes lead to a prioritized list of 85
molecules, which were then docked into our TTR:Ab computational
model [63], leading to 27 molecules that would theoretically bind to
the TTR:Ab complex and to 4 additional AD related targets (Ab, IL-10,
b-secretase and acetylcholinesterase). In addition, the initial set of
134 molecules that had been selected through docking with the
TTR:Ab model, were further analyzed computationally through the
software Ligand Scout; 13 of them coincided with the list of 27
molecules derived from the multi-target docking, but we were able
to select 4 additional molecules that matched with the common
pharmacophore.
The compounds prioritized through these two computational
(in silico ) complementary approaches that were commercially
available (Molport, http://www.molport.com), were acquired, in
order to carry out the experimental TTR binding, competition, and
stability assays (SeeTable S1in Supporting Information). Just only
in few cases, if a selected compound was not commercially avail-
able but another compound with a very similar structure was
available, then that similar compound was processed through the
computational procedures described, and acquired if it would
match with either the multi-target docking or the common phar-
macophore ﬁlters. Finally, some compounds in the market and/or
in clinical phases, that are reported in the literature as good TTR
stabilizers and/or as AD therapies under clinical studies, were also
analyzed through the computationalﬁlters described above, and
included in the ﬁnal list of compounds to be experimentally
assayed.
Recombinant wild-type human (wt rhTTR) production and
puriﬁcation. Human wild type rhTTR gene was cloned into a pET
expression system and transformed intoE. coliBL21(DE3) Star [76].
The phTTRwt-I/pET-38b(þ) plasmid was provided by Prof. Antoni
Planas (IQS, URL) [77]. The production of recombinant protein was
performed at Erlenmeyer scale, protein production and puriﬁcation
were done as described previously following an optimized version
of our protocol [78]. wt rhTTR was produced using a pET expression
System. The expressed protein only contains an additional methi-
onine on theN-terminus if compared to the mature natural human
protein sequence. wt rhTTR protein was expressed inE. coli BL21-
(DE3) cells harboring the corresponding plasmid. Expression cul-
tures in 2xYT rich medium containing 100mg/mL kanamycin were
grown at 37/C14 C to an optical density (at 600 nm) of 4 (OD600z 4),
then induced by addition of IPTG (1 mMﬁnal concentration), grown
at 37/C14 C for 20 h, and harvested by centrifugation at 4/C14 C, 10000 rpm
for 10 min and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (0,5 M Tris-HCl, pH
7.6). Cell disruption and lysis were performed by French press fol-
lowed by a sonication step at 4/C14 C. Cell debris were discarded after
centrifugation at 4/C14 C, 11000 rpm for 30 min. Intracellular proteins
were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation in three
steps. Each precipitation was followed by centrifugation at 12/C14 C,
12500 rpm for 30 min. The pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (14%
acrylamide). The TTR-containing fractions were resuspended in
20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.6 (buffer A) and dialyzed against
the same buffer. It was puriﬁed by Ion exchange chromatography
using a Q-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Biosciences)
anion exchange column and eluting with a NaCl linear gradient
using 0.1 M NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6 buffer A to 0.5 M NaCl
20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6 (buffer B). All TTR-enriched fractions were
dialyzed against deionized water in three steps and were lyophi-
lized. The protein was further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration chroma-
tography using a Superdex 75 prep grade resin (GE Healthcare Bio-
Sciences AB) and eluting with 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 0.1 M NaCl. Purest
fractions were combined and dialyzed against deionized water and
lyophilized. The purity of protein preparations was>95% as judged
by SDS-PAGE. Average production yields were 150e200 mg of pu-
riﬁed protein per liter of culture. Protein concentration was deter-
mined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using calculated
extinction coefﬁcient value of 17780 M
/C0 1 cm/C0 1 for wtTTR. The
protein was stored at/C0 20 /C14 C.
Thyroxine binding assays.Qualitative studies of the displace-
ment of T4 from WT TTR were carried out by incubation of 5mLo f

9 human plasma, with125I-T4 (speciﬁc radioactivity z1200 mCi/mg;
PerkinElmer) in the presence of the different compounds (ﬁnal
concentration of 666mM) [44,46]. Protein separation was carried
out in a native PAGE system using glycine/acetate buffer. The gel
was dried and revealed using an X-rayﬁlm.
For the quantitative analysis, T4 binding competition assays
based on a gel ﬁltration procedure was used, as previously
described [79]. Brieﬂy, 50 ml of a diluted sample (120 nM human
recombinant TTR) was incubated with 50ml of either cold T4 or
compound solutions of variable concentrations ranging from 0 to
1000 nM and with a constant amount of labeled125I-T4 (~50,000
cpm). This solution was counted in a gamma spectrometer and
incubated at 4/C14 C overnight. Protein bound125I-T4 and free125I- T4
were separated by gelﬁltration through a 1 ml BioGel P6DG (Bio-
Rad) column. The bound fraction was eluted while free T4 was
retained on the BioGel matrix. The eluate containing the bound T4
was collected and counted. Bound T4 was expressed as percentage
of total T4 added. Each assay was performed in duplicate. Analysis
of the binding data was performed with the GraphPad Prism pro-
gram (version 5.0, San Diego, CA) and data was expressed as the
EC50 ratio (EC50 T4/EC50 compound).
TTR stability assay.66Recombinant wt-TTR (333mM) was incu-
bated alone or in the presence of different compounds for 1 h at
37 /C14 C. Then, urea 8 M (used as denaturating agent) and sample
buffer without SDS were added. Samples were then run in a 15%
acrylamide gel, prepared without SDS, and transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham™ GE Healthcare e Protan
0.2 mm), using a wet system (Bio-Rad Criterion Blotter). The
membranes were blocked 1 h at RT with 5% non-fat dry milk (DM)
in PBS containing 0,05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and then incubated with
primary antibody anti-human TTR (Dako; 1:3000) in 3% DM/PBS-T.
Then, washed membranes were incubated for 1 h at RT with sheep
anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated with horseradish peroxi-
dase (The binding Site; 1:5000) in 3% DM/PBS-T. The blots were
developed using ClarityTM Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) and
levels of monomeric TTR were detected and visualized using a
chemiluminescence detection system (ChemiDoc, Bio-Rad).
Crystal structures of TTR:35 and TTR:73 complexes. Co-crys-
tallization. TTR (9.9 mg ml/C0 1) was incubated with each compound
(molar ratios35/TTR ¼ 20 and73/TTR ¼ 50) at 4/C14 C o.n., in HEPES
buffer 10 mM, pH¼ 7.5. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were
obtained by hanging-drop vapour-diffusion techniques at 20/C14 C.
Crystals were grown within 1 week by mixing 2ml of the pro-
tein:compound solutions with 2 ml of reservoir solution. The
reservoir solutions used in the crystallization trials contained ace-
tate buffer 0.2 M pH 4.8e5.4, ammonium sulfate 1.8e2.2 M, 7%
glycerol. Crystals were transferred to reservoir solutions containing
increasing concentrations of glycerol (10e25%) andﬂash frozen in
liquid nitrogen.
Data collection, processing and reﬁnement. X-ray diffraction
data sets were collected using synchrotron radiation at the XALOC
beamline at the ALBA synchrotron center (Barcelona), ID30B beam
line at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble
Cedex, France) and Proxima 2 beam line at the SOLEIL synchrotron
(Paris).
Diffraction images were processed with the XDS Program
Package [80] and the diffraction intensities converted to structure
factors in the CCP4 format [81] A random 5% sample of the reﬂec-
tion data was ﬂagged for R-free calculations [82] during model
building and reﬁnement. A summary of the data collection and
reﬁnement statistics is presented in Table S3. Initial molecular
replacement phases were generated with PhaserMR [83], using as
initial model one monomer of the complex TTR:IDIF (PDB ID 1Y1D)
[52]. The ﬁnal models were obtained after further cycles of
reﬁnement, carried out with Coot [84]and PHENIX [85].
HTS ternary assay.In this assay [28] the following stock solu-
tions were used: Buffer A: 25 mM HEPES buffer, 10 mM glycine, pH
7.4 was prepared in the absence of salt. Protein (TTR) stock: 9,5 mg/
mL (170mM) in 25 mM HEPES buffer, 10 mM glycine, pH 7.4 and 5%
DMSO (ﬁnal concentration) was prepared in the absence of salt
(buffer A). For theAb peptide stock: 0,4 mg/mL (200mM) in 25 mM
HEPES buffer, 10 mM glycine, pH 7.4 and 5% DMSO (ﬁnal concen-
tration). For the small-molecule compound IDIF, aﬁrst solution of
3,76 mg/mL (10 mM) in DMSO was prepared. Theﬁnal stock of the
small-molecule IDIF was prepared by mixing 50mL of the previous
DMSO solution with 950mL of buffer A (theﬁnal concentration of
5% DMSO).
First, the small-molecule compound and TTR complex was
formed. To this end, 60mL of TTR stock was dispensed into the wells
of a 96-well microplate. 40mL of small-molecule stock was added to
give ﬁnal concentrations of 100mM. The plate was introduced in the
microplate reader (SpectraMax M5 Multi-Mode Microplate
Readers, Molecular Devices Corporation, California, USA) and
incubated for 1 h at 37/C14 C with orbital shaking 15 s every 30 min.
Then, 100mLo fA b solution was added to the well to give aﬁnal
concentration of 100mM.
Other wells of the 96-well microplate areﬁlled with: a) Buffer
alone: 200 mL of buffer A solution was added to the well; b)
Negative control of Ab aggregation: 200 mLo fA b(1e11) stock so-
lution in buffer A was dispensed into the wells; c) Testing TTR ag-
gregation: 60mL of TTR stock were dispensed into the wells of a 96-
well microplate and 140mL of buffer A were added; d) For the
Ab(12e28) aggregation: 100 mLo fA b(12e28) stock solution is
dispensed into the wells and 100mL of buffer A were added; e)
Testing if compounds interfere with Ab(12e28) aggregation.
The plate was incubated at 37/C14 C in a thermostated microplate
reader with orbital shaking 15 s every minute for 30 min. The
absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for 6 h at 30 min intervals.
Data were collected and analyzed using Microsoft Excel software.
All assays were done in duplicate.

The parameter monitored in this assay was used to calculate the
percent reduction of formation of aggregates (RA %) according to
equation (1), where AbsAb and Absc are theﬁnal absorbance of the
samples, in the absence or in the presence of the small-molecule
compound/TTR complex; respectively.
Thioﬂavin-T (ThT)ﬂuorescence assays.The robustness of our
HTS turbidimetry-based method was further validated on the basis
of comparative by Thioﬂavin-T (ThT) ﬂuorescence assays on the
same system. The ThTﬂuorescence was monitored at 37/C14 C using
Gemini XPS plate reader (Molecular Devices) at an excitation
wavelength of 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 490 nm.
Thioﬂavin-T (ThT) was dissolved in 25 mM HEPES buffer, 10 mM
glycine, pH 7.4 and 5% DMSO to aﬁnal concentration of 25mM.
Aggregation of Ab(12e28) 50mM was performed in the presence of
25 mM ThT. All solutions were dissolved in the same buffer. TTR was
added to aﬁnal concentration of 25mM. IDIF was added to aﬁnal
concentration of 50mM. Aggregation of Ab(1e42) 20mM was per-
formed with 10mM TTR and 20mM of ligand. To test if selected
compounds interfere with Ab(1e42) aggregation, aggregation of
Ab(1e42) 20 mM was performed with 20 mM of ligands as an
important control (Figs. S2eS11). For the ternary complex, TTR was
incubated ﬁrst with IDIF for 1 h, then Ab(12e28) was added. The
ﬁnal volume was 200mL for all samples. Fluorescence intensity at
490 nm of each sample was monitored after each 2 h for 8 h, and
then at 21 h. Measurements were performed as independent trip-
licates. Recorded values were averaged and background

10 measurements (buffer containing 25 mM ThT) were subtracted.
Measurements were performed as independent triplicates. Recor-
ded values were averaged and background measurements (buffer
containing 25mM ThT) were subtracted.
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) studies.Experiments
were carried out in a VP-ITC (MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, Ma,
USA). In a titration experiment [27], the ligand in the syringe is
added in small aliquots to the macromolecule in our case TTR
protein in the calorimeter cell, which isﬁlled with an effective
volume that is sensed calorimetrically. The TTR solution of 20mM,
and Ab (Ab(12e28) or Ab(1e40)), or ligand solutions of 200mM
were prepared in the same buffer. The titrant was injected over 20
or 30 times at a constant interval of 300 s with a 450 rpm rotating
stirrer syringe into the sample cell containing its binding partner.
All solutions were prepared with 25 mM HEPES buffer, 10 mM
glycine, pH 7.4 and 5% DMSO (ﬁnal concentration) and it was
corroborated that at these conditions TTR and Ab(1e40) are stable.
Ab(1e40) working solution was prepared at 200 mM and used
immediately, to avoid premature aggregate formation. TTR stock
solution was prepared at 40mM. Ligand stock solution was prepared
at 10 mM in DMSO. All solutions were prepared in the same buffer
and ﬁltered prior to use. In the control experiments, the titrant
(ligand or A
b) was injected into the buffer in the sample cell to
measure the heat of dilution. This value of the heat of dilution was
subtracted from the titration data. The experiments were per-
formed at 25 /C14 C. Titration data were analyzed by the evaluation
software, MicroCal Origin, Version 7.0. The binding curves were
ﬁtted by a non-linear regression method to a one set of sites
binding model. This leads to the calculation ofK, n, DH, DS, andDG.
Each experiment was conducted three times, and the mean value
with standard deviations is provided.

13 ","The study focuses on transthyretin (TTR) as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). It discusses TTR's role in AD, its tetramer stabilization by resveratrol and iododi-flunisal, and methods to enhance drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier. Kinetic assays and high-throughput screening are used to identify potential inhibitors of TTR amyloid fibrillogenesis. The research also involves comparative studies of TTR variants with protective effects on familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). Crystallographic techniques, such as X-ray diffraction analysis, are employed for detailed structural characterization. The study highlights the importance of TTR tetrameric stability and its potential in AD treatment.","Transthyretin (TTR) has a well-established role in neuroprotection in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We have setup a drug discovery program of small-molecule compounds that act as chaperones enhancing TTR/Amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) interactions. A combination of computational drug repurposing approaches and in vitro biological assays have resulted in a set of molecules which were then screened with our in-house validated high-throughput screening ternary test. A prioritized list of chaperones was obtained and corroborated with ITC studies. Small-molecule chaperones have been discovered, among them our lead compound Iododiflunisal (IDIF), a molecule in the discovery phase; one investigational drug (luteolin); and 3 marketed drugs (sulindac, olsalazine and flufenamic), which could be directly repurposed or repositioned for clinical use. Not all TTR tetramer stabilizers behave as chaperones in vitro. These chemically diverse chaperones will be used for validating TTR as a target in vivo, and to select one repurposed drug as a candidate to enter clinical trials as AD disease-modifying drug.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is the leading cause of dementia. AD is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-b (Ab) aggregates in various conformations, filamentous intraneuronal inclusions mainly constituted by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (p-Tau), and synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss [1]. One of the most difficult challenges in AD research is to find a disease modifying therapy (DMT), this is, a therapy with an agent that produces an enduring change in the clinical progression of AD, by changing the biology of AD and producing neuroprotection by interfering in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease process that lead to cell death (often through a variety of intermediate mechanisms such as effects on amyloid or tau) [2]. The five drugs available in the market for AD are involved in only improving symptoms and are highly patient dependent. Aduhelm (aducanumab) [3,4], by Biogen and Eisai, an antibody that targets amyloid-beta, was approved in June 2021 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under its accelerated approval pathway. FDA approval of Aduhelm, the first drug with a putative disease-modifying mechanism for AD treatment, has been met with a fair degree of skepticism and controversy [5,6]. No other putative disease modifying drugs or new symptomatic treatments for AD have achieved regulatory approval since 2003 [7]. There are 126 agents in the current AD treatment pipeline, 28 of them in phase III, 74 in phase II and 24 in phase I clinical trials. The majority of drugs in trials (82.5%) target the underlying biology of AD with the intent of disease modification [8]. AD drug development is not delivering new drugs in the last decades. Among the many explanations for such failure, one is the lack of new chemical entities from drug discovery approaches that reach the clinical phase I level [9e12]. There is an urgent need to find a treatment that prevents, delays the onset or slows the progression of this devastating disease. With the aim of contributing with new candidate drugs that, after preclinical tests, may feed the currently exhausted pipeline of drugs in phase I for AD, we have settled a drug discovery program targeting transthyretin (TTR) and searching for small-molecule chaperones that may improve the neuroprotective function of TTR in AD. Transthyretin (TTR), a homotetrameric protein mainly synthesized by the liver and the choroid plexus (CP), and secreted into the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), respectively, has been specially recognised for its functions as a transporter protein of thyroxine (T4) and retinol [13]. The importance of TTR has also been robustly established in AD pathogenesis [14]. It is most remarkable that TTR is the main Ab binding protein in the CSF.[15-17] This binding is believed to naturally prevent Ab aggregation and toxicity in this media. Comparative analysis of TTR evidenced decreased levels of this protein, not only in the CSF [18,19] but also in plasma [20e22] of AD patients, compared to controls. AD TTR-hemizygous mice showed increased Ab production and deposition, compared to AD TTR WT littermates [23], whereas overexpressing human TTR WT in an AD mouse model decreased neuropathology and Ab deposition [24]. Regarding the mechanisms proposed as underlying TTR neuroprotection in AD, ex vivo and in vitro studies, established that TTR has the ability to bind to Ab, avoiding its aggregation and toxicity [25e30]. Recent reports suggest that TTR binds to Ab oligomers and inhibits primary and secondary nucleation processes [29,30]. TTR was also shown to assist Ab brain efflux through the blood-brain barrier, and to promote its degradation in the liver. Results also revealed that TTR regulates the expression of LRP1, by increasing its levels, both in the brain and in the liver [31]. Recent data implicated TTR reduction in the thickening of the basement membrane of brain microvessels in AD mice,[32] an alteration that also occurs in the AD brain [33]. TTR tetrameric stability appears as a key factor in its interaction with Ab peptide. Interestingly, TTR stability is also a key factor in Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) [ 34,35] a systemic amyloidosis with a special involvement of the peripheral nerve system, which results from the aggregation, deposition and toxicity of mutated TTR. Since it is believed that tetramer dissociation into monomers is the first step leading to TTR amyloid formation [36], TTR tetrameric stabilization has been defined as the basis for one of the possible therapeutic strategies in FAP [37e39]. Such stabilization can be achieved through the use of small compounds sharing molecular structural similarities with thyroxine (T4) which bind in the T4 central binding channel [40,41]. The search for TTR stabilizing ligands using virtual screening and computational procedures has been carried out previously [42e44] and there is a large number of TTR and TTR-ligand three dimensional structures reported at the PDB [45]. These computational and structural studies have been instrumental in the design, discovery and development of TTR stabilizing compounds that have either reached the market, like Tafamidis [46,47], or that have reached clinical phases, like Tolcapone, a repurposed drug approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Fig. 1)[ 48]. We have demonstrated by early in vitro studies that TTR and Ab bind together and that this interaction can be enhanced by a small set of TTR tetramer-stabilizing compounds [ 49], one of them Iododiflunisal (IDIF), a iodinated analog of the NSAID diflunisal (DIF) (Fig. 1)[ 50e52]. More importantly, in vivo administration of IDIF to a mouse model of AD, resulted in decreased brain Ab levels and deposition [53,54], and improving the cognitive functions that are impaired in this AD-like neuropathology [53]. Drug repurposing of already known drugs for new indications is a drug discovery approach increasingly being used to search for new therapies for diseases with unmet clinical needs. Both in silico [55,56] and experimental [57] approaches on drug repurposing have been recently reviewed, as well as the application of this approach to drug discovery for AD [58-60]. Furthermore, another interesting strategy in drug discovery is the multi-target approach, which aims to have a synergistic effect thanks to the interaction of a given ligand with different targets that are involved in a disease's pathway. Therefore, these synergies through target promiscuity could be translated into lower doses and reduced side effects [61,62]. In this paper, we report the discovery of TTR stabilizers through two complementary in silico drug repurposing approaches, as well as the systematic biological evaluation of the selected compounds on TTR stability, through competition with T4 for TTR binding, and by measuring the amount of monomers. This process has led to the prioritization of a set of 53 TTR tetramer stabilizing compounds and to an analysis of their ability to enhance the TTR/Ab interaction. Using our in-house validated high-throughput screening (HTS) ternary assay [28], we have evaluated these 53 small-molecule compounds and have obtained a subset of small molecule chaperones (SMCs), among them our lead compound IDIF, one clinical phase compound (luteolin), and three approved drugs for other diseases (sulindac, olsalazine and flufenamic acid), that could enter clinical trials for AD as repurposed drugs.","Computational studies. In order to find small molecule chaperones that enhance the TTR/Ab interaction, two computational pipelines have been established, addressing drug repurposing and polypharmacology, as shown in Fig. 2. The first approach started with the construction of a TTR/Ab model [63] as described in the Experimental Section. Then, compounds from the Integrity database (https://integrity.clarivate.com/integrity/xmlxsl/) and from the literature were selected, so as they were either (i) known TTR binders, (ii) amyloid peptide binding ligands, or (iii) both, or (iv) compounds under study in clinical phases for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The use of the CARLSBAD software and database [64] allowed us to find privileged scaffolds with reported biological activity against both TTR and Ab systems. This scaffold hunting methodology allowed us to find a group of compounds containing the stilbene substructure and able to interact with both entities (TTR and Ab). Then, this stilbene scaffold was used to select molecules by substructure search in the Integrity-derived and literature-derived databases already mentioned, and the selected compounds were then prioritized by docking into our TTR/Ab model [63]. In total, 48 compounds with docking scores similar to IDIF (used as the cross-reference compound in the docking experiments) were prioritized, and 20 of them, that were commercially available, were selected and acquired to carry out the experimental assays. A second computational approach was carried out in order to exploit the drug-promiscuity and polypharmacology in a multitarget-based pipeline. This methodology allowed us to identify molecules able to bind TTR that also bind additional targets that have been associated with the treatment of AD and that are relevant in its pathological pathways. As described in the Experimental section, this strategy includes multi-target molecular docking and molecular searches through common pharmacophore models to a set of targets (Fig. 2B). Starting from the Integrity database (https://integrity.clarivate.com/integrity/xmlxsl/), which contains small molecules and drugs in the market or advanced clinical phases, we selected nearly 1400 compounds that were reported in preclinical, clinical or marketed phase and that had their protein target reported as one or more of the following, which have been associated to AD: APP (amyloid precursor protein); AchE (acetylcholinesterase); IL-10 (interleukin-10); a-, b- and g-secretases; Tau protein; GABA and glutamate receptors. All these compounds were then docked into the TTR model, prioritizing a pool of 134 molecules that would theoretically bind the TTR T4-channel with an affinity similar to IDIF. These molecules were then analyzed theoretically through cross-docking into the following protein structures: IL-10 (Interleukin-10) (PDB code 1ILK); inhibitor domain of APP (amyloid beta-protein precursor) (PDB code 1AAP); b-secretase (memapsin 2) complexed with inhibitor OM99-2 (PDB code 1FKN); human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) complexed with fasciculin-II (PDB code 1B41); metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 with LY341495 antagonist (PDB code 3KS9); metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 with glutamate (PDB code 3LMK). All these docking experiments lead to a prioritized list of 85 molecules, which were filtered to 27 molecules that would theoretically bind to TTR/Ab complex (by docking experiments) and 4 additional AD related targets (multi-target docking approach for ligand selection). In addition, the 134 molecules that were selected before through docking with TTR were further analyzed computationally through the software LigandScout [65]. A common pharmacophore was built starting from the binding sites of TTR, b-secretase, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, and then the 134 molecules were screened against this pharmacophore; 13 of them coincided with the list of 27 molecules derived from the multi-target docking, but we were able to select 4 additional molecules that matched with the common pharmacophore. The Table S1 in the Supporting Information contains all the chemical structures of the compounds that were selected through these computational procedures, as well as other molecules (that had been reported as TTR ligands, in the literature, and from previous studies in our laboratory), which were also selected after docking them into our TTR/Ab model, and the results of the associated experimental assays for all the selected molecules, which are described hereunder. Thyroxine binding assays and TTR stability assays. To confirm the ability of the proposed compounds to bind TTR we designed a flow chart through which all the selected compounds were experimentally assayed (Fig. 3). The first assay, to which all compounds were submitted, was a T4 displacement assay [48,50]. In brief, radiolabeled [125I]-T4 was incubated alone or in the presence of each of the compounds with TTR, and then samples were run in a native PAGE gel. Compounds that are able to bind to TTR in the T4 central binding channel, and thus to displace [125I]-T4, result in decreased intensity of the [125I]-T4/TTR band. When using plasma as a source of TTR, which is the case of the present work, this approach also enables the visualization of the bands corresponding to the other T4 transporter proteins, such as thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and albumin. IDIF was used as a reference compound (see representative example in Fig. 3A). This assay, although not quantitative, is of utmost importance, in particular when using human plasma, since it also reveals the effect of the compounds in the other referred T4 transporter proteins, and therefore, on their specificity for TTR binding. Using this approach, we characterized the behavior of the compounds regarding their ability to displace T4 and their specificity for TTR binding (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information for a complete view of the behavior of all compounds in the qualitative T4 displacement assay). In addition to high affinity for TTR, compounds should also be specific for this protein, since lack of specificity, together with the high abundance of other plasma proteins, such as albumin, for instance, could lead to failure in therapeutics. However, at this stage of our selection, we mainly aimed at identifying strong TTR stabilizers which will be further investigated for their capacity to enhance the TTR/Ab interaction. Thus, at this point all compounds that completely or significantly displaced T4 from TTR, were selected for the quantitative assay regardless of their specificity (Table S1). Selected compounds were then evaluated in a quantitative T4 assay to determine their EC50 and values were compared to the EC50 of T4 (a representative example is given in Fig. 3B, results in Table S2). Analysis of results enabled us to conclude that only compounds that showed complete T4 displacement in the Fig. 1. Chemical structures of TTR tetramer stabilizers: the orphan drug Tafamidis, the Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diflunisal (DIF), the repurposed drug Tolcapone for Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and our lead compound Iododiflunisal (IDIF). qualitative assay, produced EC50 T4/EC50 compound ratios higher than 1, i.e., with affinity to TTR higher than the one of T4. Nevertheless, a ratio of EC50 T4/EC50 compound of 0.5 or superior was used to identify a pool of compounds able to bind TTR efficiently and therefore those that should be tested in our proprietary HTS ternary assay [28]. In some instances, compounds revealed a non-standard or ambiguous behavior, hindering the statistical analysis performed for the rest of the compounds. Nonetheless, and in order to avoid elimination of compounds that could stabilize TTR by pathways other than binding to the T4 binding site, all of the non-selected compounds were assessed in a TTR stability assay [66]. This approach was employed to test and to evaluate the ability of the non-selected compounds to stabilize TTR, by electrophoretic means, under semi-denaturing conditions, as described in the Experimental section. As readout, we assessed the levels of monomeric TTR upon incubation with each compound and values were compared to those obtained in the absence of compound. Fig. 3C displays representative results obtained in this stability assay showing different levels of the TTR monomer. The graphic represents the intensity of the monomer band, considering the value of 1 for the control. Compounds that reduced the intensity of the monomer band to at least half of the intensity in the control, were considered for the final list of the compounds to enter a future ternary assay (Table S1). Altogether, compounds selected from the T4 quantitative and the TTR stability assays constitute a subset of 53 molecules amenable to be screened using our proprietary HTS ternary assay (Table S4 in the Supporting Information). Crystal structures of TTR:ligand complexes. From this final list of compounds to enter a future ternary assay, two compounds, 35 and 73, were selected for the structure elucidation of the TTR complexes by X-ray diffraction, because their TTR-ligand structures have not been previously analyzed (Table S3 in Supporting Information). Both compounds bind in the so-called thyroxine binding sites (Fig. 4). Compound 35 (Fig. 4, left panel) binds very deeply with the iodinated ring located at the outmost part of the T4 channel. This binding induces the rotation of Ser117 side chains of the four monomers creating new strong intermonomer hydrogen bonds between these residues. The Lys15 residues, located at the entrance of the binding sites, establish interactions with the carboxylate substituents of the ligand. Compound 73 does not bind so deeply in the channel as 35 (Fig. 4, right panel) and, consequently, it does not induce the formation of such strong interactions between the Ser117 residues of the TTR tetramer. The Lys15 residues, in the TTR:73 complex, are not pointing to the center of the channel and are not involved in interactions with the compound. Selection of small-molecule chaperones (SMCs): HTS ternary assay, ITC studies and ThT assays. To efficiently screen for potential small-molecule chaperones of the TTR/Ab interaction, we have used our recently in house developed and validated high-throughput assay that relies on the ability of the test compounds to prevent Ab aggregation in solutions of preformed TTR/Ab Fig. 2. Computational workflows for the selection of modulators of TTR/Ab interaction (A) Based on drug repurposing and multi-target approach; (B) Based on multi-target computational docking and searches on common pharmacophores for several targets. complexes [28]. The assay makes use of Ab(12e28) which has analogous properties as full length Ab peptides but is a less expensive and more stable peptide. Thus, the recombinant wtTTR is incubated with the test compound (ratio TTR/compound 1:2) during 1 h and then, Ab(12e28) is added to the complex and UV monitoring of turbidity for 6 h allows to determine its potency. A complete high-throughput screening in this ternary assay was carried out for all the 53 compounds previously selected from computational and biological studies (see Fig. S1 and Table S5 in the Supporting Information). After classifying the compounds according to their potency at reducing Ab aggregation a prioritized list was obtained (See Fig. 5). In this list we found our lead compound IDIF, the natural product luteolin (LUT), a compound in clinical phases, and three registered drugs, olsalazine (OLS), sulindac (SUL) and flufenamic acid (FLU), among others (See Fig. 5C). Furthermore, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) technique has been used to corroborate the chaperoning effect of five of the best small-molecule compounds as described previously [27]. Thus, we have compared the binding in the Ab(12e28)/TTR/SMC ternary complexes with the binary interaction Ab(12e28)/TTR (Figs. S12 and S13 at the Supporting Information). In addition, a full thermodynamic characterization of the ternary complexes with Ab(1e40) and TTR and each of the five best selected SMCs was obtained (Fig. 6). The binary TTR/Ab(1e40) (1:1) complex formation shows a dissociation constant of Kd = 6.49 mM. However, IDIF enhances this interaction between TTR and Ab(1e40), since the Kd is reduced to 3.34mM when TTR in the presence of IDIF is titrated Fig. 3.

(See compounds in Table S1 at the SI). with Ab(1e40). Similar improvements were observed for the ternary complexes with the best SMCs (i.e. Kd = 1.52 mM (LUT); 3.42 mM (SUL); 0.81mM (OLS) and 2.34mM (FLU)). To complement the results gathered so far, we performed the aggregation kinetics of Ab(1e42) in the presence of the five selected SMCs using by ThT assays, obtaining coherent results with the turbidity measurements observed with Ab(12e28) (Fig. 7). Interestingly, none of the best small molecule chaperones interfered with the aggregation kinetics of Ab(1e42) (Figs. S2eS11). Additionally, we have performed dose-response studies on the binary interaction TTR/Ab (Fig. 7B) and in the ternary interaction when TTR is complexed with IDIF (Fig. 7C). As shown in Fig. 7C the aggregation kinetics of Ab(1e42) in the presence of TTR complexed with IDIF are concentration dependent of this small-compound. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that Ab peptides and their oligomeric forms are toxic to neural cells leading to apoptosis and cellular death. It is also well established that TTR protects against this neurotoxicity [ 25,29,30]. To evaluate Ab-induced neuronal apoptosis in the presence of TTR stabilized by the selected SMCs, we evaluated caspase 3 activation in SH-SY5Y cells. We confirmed that TTR prevented the noxious effect of Ab(1e42) peptide, reducing significantly the levels of caspase-3 activation, as compared to those produced by the oligomers. Also, as we previously reported [28], TTR stabilized by IDIF was even more potent at protecting against Ab toxicity, as caspase 3 levels were significantly reduced when compared to those generated in cells treated with Ab(1e42) co-incubated with TTR (without IDIF). Importantly, the effect of flufenamic acid (FLU), olsalazine (OLS), and luteolin (LUT) was found to be similar to that of IDIF. Sulindac (SUL), while promoting the protection conferred by TTR, was not as strong as the other tested compounds (Supporting Information, Fig. S14). The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one of the bottlenecks in brain drug development and is the single most important factor limiting the future growth of neurotherapeutics [67]. In our previous papers we have shown that BBB penetration is facilitated by the binding of IDIF to TTR [53,54,68]. Importantly, the BBB penetration ability of some of our selected compounds has been previously reported in the literature [69e71]. Here, we have also analyzed in silico the molecular properties of the 5 selected compounds, and results predict that they cross the BBB (See Supporting Information) [72,73]. Altogether, these results confirm that TTR is a neuroprotective protein, preventing Ab toxicity, and that TTR performance can be enhanced by small-molecule chaperones of the TTR/Ab interaction, prompting TTR stabilization as a promising therapeutic strategy in AD."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenera-
tivedisease.Notably,neuroinﬂammationisamongtheforemost
events in AD pathogenesis.[18–20] CCL2 secretion is increased in
ADpatientsandanimalmodels. [21,22] Therefore,theuseofmem-
branes with high expression of CCR2 for precise targeting of
early-stage lesions is a novel strategy for the eﬀective treatment
ofAD.
Intriguingly, concurrent pathological changes in AD, such
as the emergence of amyloid plaques, tau pathology, and neu-
ronaldegenerationfrequentlycooccurwithneuroinﬂammation,
forging a reinforcing interplay. Considering the multifaceted
nature of AD and lessons from past unsuccessful attempts to
develop drugs for AD, a combination of medications targeting
diﬀerent mechanisms is more advantageous than a single-drug
approach.[23] Nanocarriers provide an opportunity not only to
optimize dosing regimens but also to improve the eﬀectiveness
of multidrug therapies. In AD, a decrease in autophagy leads to
aninabilitytoclearawayharmfulproteins,resultinginneuronal
death and glial cell activation, and ultimately triggering the de-
velopment of a complex neuroinﬂammatory environment.[13,24]
Several studies have demonstrated that rapamycin is a poten-
tial small molecule for enhancing autophagy and reducing
the burden of pathological proteins in AD.[24,25] However, its
extremely low BBB pass rate limits its clinical application.[26] In
addition, to align the carrier’s function with targeting inﬂam-
matory lesions, we considered adding another drug that can
inhibitneuroinﬂammationtoimprovetheextracellularenviron-
ment. 1-Triﬂuoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)
urea (TPPU), an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH),
has been reported to prevent glial cell reactivation and alle-
viate cognitive deﬁcits in the brains of AD mice.[27] These
results suggest that TPPU may be a potent candidate for
encapsulation.
Based on the above considerations, we proposed an original
strategy that uses nanotechnology (Figure 1). We developed a
hybridization system by combining a platelet membrane and a
membranewithhighexpressionofCCR2,andloadedtwosmall
molecule drugs (rapamycin and TPPU) on these hybrid lipo-
somes, to target and treat pathological areas in the brain asso-
ciatedwithAD.

ChemotaxistowardCCL2
In order to label the CCR2 protein, we fused it with an RFP
(mScarlet). Firstly, we transfected the plasmid encoding the
cDNAofthefusionproteinintoHEK293Tcells.TheCCR2-RFP
wasfoundtobeapproximately70kDa( Figure2A)andlocatedin
the cell membrane (Figure2B), which showed that RFP did not
change the expression or cellular location of CCR2. To further
verify whether CCR2 is expressed on the outer side of the cell
membrane,weusedﬂowcytometrytoisolatecellswithRFP,and
found that approximately two-thirds of these cells coexpressed
CCR2(Figure S1A,SupportingInformation).Thisresultshowed
thatmostoftheCCR2proteinwaslocatedontheoutersideofthe
cell membrane, and preliminarily indicated that it can function
asareceptor.
Then,wewantedtoclarifywhetherthefusionproteinretained

constructedtheplasmidofCCL2,andtheoverexpressedproteins
weredetectedusingWesternblotting(Figure 2C).CCR2-RFPand
CCL2 were colocalized on the cell membrane after cotransfec-
tion (FigureS1B, Supporting Information), which may indicate

2.2.PreparationandCharacterizationofHybridCellMembrane
We extracted the platelet membrane and overexpressed CCR2-
RFP HEK293T cell membrane separately. Coomassie brilliant
blue staining revealed diﬀerences in the protein ladders among
the diﬀerent components (cell membrane, supernatant, and
whole cell) of both cell membranes (FigureS2A,B, Supporting
Information). We further blotted the marker proteins located
on the membrane of the platelets (Figure 3A) and CCR2-RFP
HEK293T cells (Figure3B). There were three clusters of diﬀer-
entiation (CD) antigens (CD41, CD61 and CD62P) enriched in
thecellmembraneofplatelets(Figure 3A).InHEK293Tcells,the
expressionofCCR2-RFPandNa-K-ATPaseinthecellmembrane
wasmuchgreaterthanthatoftheothercomponents.Moreover,
RFPwasbroadlydistributedinthecellmembraneandcytoplasm
(Figure3B).
Then, we prepared cell membrane hybrid liposomes, and
Western blotting demonstrated that the hybrid cell membrane
coexpressed the marker proteins found in both platelets and

cell membranes were successfully fused, we labeled them with
diﬀerent ﬂuorophores. To determine the optimal fusion ratio,
we also established three groups with diﬀerent ratios of platelet
and CCR2-RFP HEK293T cell membranes (Group 1: PLT:293T
= 1:1; Group 2: PLT:293T= 1:2; Group 3: PLT:293T= 2:1). We
calculated the colocalization index (Pearson’sR2) based on ﬂu-

somes were strongly colocalized in all three groups at diﬀerent

2.3.RapamycinandTPPURescueCellDeathinanInVitroAD
Model
It has been reported that autophagy and neuroinﬂammation
play important roles in the occurrence and progression of AD.
In 12 month old 5xFAD mice, the p-mTOR/mTOR ratio was
increased, while the LC3II/I ratio was decreased signiﬁcantly
(Figure S3A,C,D, Supporting Information), indicating that au-
tophagy was inhibited in AD and exacerbated the burden of
pathological proteins. In addition, soluble epoxide hydrolase
(sEH),whichisassociatedwithamoresevereinﬂammatoryenvi-
ronmentwasfoundtobeupregulatedinADmice(Figure S3B,E,
SupportingInformation).Therefore,weconsideredusinganau-
tophagy enhancer (rapamycin) and an sEH inhibitor (TPPU) to
treatAD.
AninvitroADmodelwassubsequentlyestablishedwithATRA
and A𝛽42(Figure S3F–H, Supporting Information). After treat-
ment with rapamycin or TPPU for 24 h, we observed minimal
drugtoxicityatlowconcentrations.Theoptimaltherapeuticcon-
centrations of rapamycin and TPPU were found to be 250 and
1000nmolL −1,respectively(Figure S3I–L,SupportingInforma-
tion). These results show that rapamycin and TPPU can rescue
cell death in an in vitro AD model, and we identiﬁed the appro-
priateconcentrationfortreatment.
2.4.PreparationandcharacterizationofDrug-LoadedHybridCell
MembraneLiposomes
ThehybridliposomeswereobservedviaTEM( Figure4A,B).Re-
gardless of whether the hybrid cell membrane liposomes con-
tained drugs, they maintained a vesicle structure. However, the
particle size of the hybrid liposomes loaded with two drugs
(TR@CPL and TR@PL) was larger than that of the other li-
posomes (Figure4C). The zeta potentials of the seven groups
wereroughlysimilar(Figure 4D).Thenweanalyzedtheentrap-
ment eﬃciency and loading eﬃciency of rapamycin and TPPU
(Figure4E,F;Figure S4,SupportingInformation).Weﬁrsttested
the encapsulation of a single drug. The loading eﬃciency of
100 μgm L−1 TPPU had reached a stable level, but the entrap-
menteﬃciencydecreased(Figure S4C,SupportingInformation);
rapamycin at a dose of 64μgm L−1 exhibited the highest en-
trapment eﬃciency among all the tested groups (FigureS4D,
Supporting Information). When rapamycin and TPPU were si-
multaneouslyadded,theloadingeﬃciencycontinuedtoincrease
(Figure 4E), and the optimal dose ratio of the two drugs was
100:64 μgm L−1 (TPPU: rapamycin) (Figure4F). The cumula-
tivereleaseamountsofTPPUandrapamycinwereapproximately
30%and40%,respectively,over72h(Figure 4G,H).
To validate whether the hybrid liposomes can cross the BBB
and migrate to inﬂammatory lesions in vivo, 5xFAD mice at 3
monthsofagewereinjectedwithDiR-labeledliposomes.Theﬂu-
orescencecouldbedetectedinthebrain,andthesignalreached
its peak at 12 h (Figure 5A). Comparing the three groups with
diﬀerent ratios of platelet and CCR2-RFP HEK293T cell mem-
branes, the pass rate of Group 3 (platelet CM: HEK293T CM
= 2:1) was signiﬁcantly greater than that of the other groups
(Figure5B).Inadditiontobeingenrichedinthebrain,liposomes
were also enriched in the liver, spleen, and kidney (Figure5C).
We also found that liposomes could enter the CNS in wild-type
(WT)mice(Figure S5A,SupportingInformation),buttherewas
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among the three groups (FigureS5B,
Supporting Information). In addition, more liposomes crossed
the BBB in AD mice (FigureS5C, Supporting Information),
which suggested the BBB dysfunction in AD. Twelve hours af-
terintravenousinjection,weextractedbraintissuesfrom5xFAD
mice and prepared brain sections. Compared to the brain tis-
sueofthegroupinjectedwiththeRFPHEK293T-platelethybrid
membrane, the brain tissue of the group injected with CCR2-
RFP HEK293T-platelet membrane hybrid liposomes showed li-
posomeaccumulationaroundmicroglia(Figure 5D,E)andastro-
cytes(Figure 5F,G).ThisindicatesthattheCPLswereabletotar-
getinﬂammatorylesions.
2.5.Drug-LoadedHybridCellMembraneLiposomesAmeliorate
ADSymptomsBothInVitroandInVivo
First, we evaluated the biosafety and therapeutic eﬃcacy of the
liposomes in vitro. There were eight groups: PBS, TPPU, Ra-
pamycin, TPPU+Rapamycin, T@CPL, R@CPL, TR@CPL, and
TR@PL. According to the rescuing eﬃciency, the concentra-
tions of rapamycin and TPPU were 2.3 and 3.6μgm L−1,r e -
spectively. To comprehensively evaluate the role of liposomes
in vitro, we selected various cell lines, including neuronal cells
(HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell line, and SH-SY5Y neurob-
lastoma cell line) and glial cells (BV2 microglial cell line). In
the BV2 and HT22 cell lines, cell viability did not signiﬁcantly
decrease in any of the groups (FigureS6A,B, Supporting Infor-
mation),whichshowedthatthemicromoleculardrugsandlipo-
somes had low biological toxicity. We further analyzed the ther-
apeuticeﬃcacyofSH-SY5Ycellsstablytransfectedwithmutant
APP (K595N/M596L), and BV2 and HT22 cells stimulated with
A𝛽42.Thedrugsandliposomesamelioratedthecelldeathcaused
by excessive A𝛽42 (FigureS6C–E, Supporting Information). We
also found that TR@CPLs performed better than single drug-
loaded liposomes and TR@PLs. Compared to uncoated drugs,
CCR2-RFP-coatedHEK293Tandplateletcellmembranessignif-
icantlyincreasedtheviabilityofBV2cells(Figure S6D,Support-
ingInformation).
The treatment of 5xFAD mice started at the age of 3 months
via intravenous tail vein injections three times a week. Af-
ter a 6 week treatment, we conducted behavioral tests on the
mice. Then, we extracted tissues for subsequent experiments

5xFAD mice treated with T@CPL; 6) 5xFAD mice treated with
TR@CPL; and 7) 5xFAD mice treated with TR@PL. The con-
centrations of rapamycin and TPPU in each group were 45.7
and 71.9μgm L−1, achieving blood concentrations of 0.23 and
0.36 mg kg−1, respectively. The open ﬁeld test is used to assess
motor function, exploratory behavior, anxiety, and depression.

2.6.Drug-LoadedHybridCellMembraneLiposomesReduced
AmyloidPlaquesandAlleviatedNeuroinﬂammation
Afterthebehavioraltests,wecarriedoutaseriesofpathological
testsonthebraintissue.TheexpressionofAPPwassigniﬁcantly
reducedintheT@CPLandTR@CPLgroups( Figure7A,B),but
there was no signiﬁcant change in tau pathology (Figure7A,C).
Because the target of rapamycin is autophagy, we also detected
the marker LC3II/I and found that its expression increased in
theR@CPLandTR@CPLgroups(Figure 7A,D),whichindicated
thatrapamycinpromotedautophagy.
Next, we observed amyloid plaques using immunoﬂuores-
cence. All four groups with liposomes had moderate patho-
logical protein burdens in both the cortex and hippocampus,
with TR@CPL showing the most signiﬁcant therapeutic eﬀect
(Figure 7E–G). Additionally, we wondered whether liposomes
could alleviate neuroinﬂammation as reﬂected by glial cells.
TherewaslessglialcellinﬁltrationinthebrainsintheT@CPL,
TR@CPL, and TR@PL groups (Figure7H–J). Moreover, com-
pared to TP@PLs, TP@CPLs signiﬁcantly reduced the number
of glial cell aggregates (Figure7H,I). This result suggested that
TPPU has potential anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects, especially when
combined with CCR2 overexpressing cell membrane coatings.
Furthermore, we validated the biosafety of drug-loaded hybrid
cell membrane liposomes via HE staining. There were no ap-
parent abnormalities in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, or kidney
amongthegroups(Figure S7,SupportingInformation).
3.Discussion
Inthisstudy,weinnovativelydesignedahybridliposomalsystem

tion was focused on two primary objectives. Initially, we eluci-
datedthepotential ofthisnovelnanocarrierforprecisely target-
inginﬂammatorylesionswithinthebrainthrougheﬃcientBBB
traversal. Subsequently, our research successfully encapsulated
two separate therapeutic agents, rapamycin and TPPU, within
hybrid cell membrane-coated liposomes, thereby facilitating a
synergistic and multitargeted therapeutic strategy against AD.
Theresultsfrombothinvitroandinvivoexperimentshavecon-
clusively demonstrated the remarkable therapeutic potential of
drug-loadedhybridcell-membraneliposomesinthetreatmentof
AD.Ourﬁndingsindicatethatthehybridcell-membrane-coated
liposome system has the potential to develop eﬀective, precise
and multitargeted treatments for AD. This opens the door to
more eﬀective treatment regimens and the potential for more
personalizedtherapeuticstrategies.
In recent years, the development of nanomaterials has rev-
olutionized the ﬁeld of medicine, particularly in the treatment
of CNS diseases.[28] Among the various nanotechnologies, cell
membrane-coated nanoparticles (CM-NPs) have emerged as a
promising approach for targeted therapy. CM-NPs combine the
beneﬁts of both synthetic nanoparticles and natural cell mem-
branes, oﬀering enhanced biocompatibility, prolonged circula-
tion time, and improved targeting ability.[29] In the context of
AD, these nanoparticles have shown great potential in over-
coming BBB impermeability and delivering therapeutic agents
speciﬁcally to aﬀected brain regions.[30] Among the cell mem-
branes, the erythrocyte membrane is the most frequently used
inADtherapy. [31–33] Recentstudieshavealsodesignedcellmem-
branecamouﬂagenanosystemsfrommicroglialBV2cells [34] and
macrophages[35] againstAD.
There is still a lack of therapeutic strategies for AD using
plateletmembranesascoatings.Theoretically,theplateletmem-
brane has considerable advantages as a coating in the applica-
tionofADtreatment.First,theplateletmembraneexpressesvar-
ious membrane proteins. The presence of CD47 on the platelet
membrane surface enables it to interact with signaling regula-
toryproteinsonimmunecellsandinhibitimmunecell-mediated
clearance of CM-NPs,[36] thereby prolonging the circulation of
nanomedicine. Platelets also express unique surface ligands for
targeting tissues or cells, especially damaged vascular systems.
In the damaged vascular system, glycoprotein Ib/V/IX and von
Willebrand factor bind to exposed collagen to form complexes,
and platelets can initiate the coagulation process by binding to
thesecomplexesthroughintegrins. [37] Ourresultsdemonstrated
that multiple integrins are expressed on the surface of mouse
plateletmembranesandcanmigratearounddamagedbloodves-
sels.ThedestructionoftheBBBinADisessentiallyatypeofmi-
crovascular injury, which suggests that platelet membranes can
pass through the BBB. As shown by the biodistribution analy-
sis,cell-membranehybridliposomeswithahigherproportionof
plateletmembraneshadagreaterBBBpenetrationrate.
In addition to single cell membrane coated nanotechnology,
severalstrategieshavebeenemployedtocoatsyntheticnanopar-
ticleswithcellmembranesderivedfromdiﬀerentcelltypes,such
as erythrocytes, neural stem cells, and macrophages. These hy-
brid nanoparticles can eﬀectively mimic the surface properties
and functionalities of source cells, enabling them to selectively
interactwithtargetcellsortissues. [9,10] However,researchonthe
use of hybrid cell membrane-coated nanoparticles for the treat-
ment of neurological disorders (NDs) is still in its early stages.
To date, kinds of hemocytes have been hybridized with cancer
cells and applied to brain tumors.[38–41] However, there are no

in vivo. Although autologous microglia, astrocytes and neurons
can express CCR2 on the membrane,[43] our strategy may have
several advantages. Compared to that of primary cells, the re-
producibility of such engineered cells is superior. In addition,

Nevertheless, despite the substantial progress made, chal-
lenges remain. The scalability and reproducibility of cell-
membrane coating methods need to be improved to meet clin-
icaldemands.Theengineeredextractionofextracellularvesicles
(EVs) secreted from cells may provide some insights. A recent
study revealed that microglial macrosomes reduce the amyloid
burden and ameliorate AD, but microsomes have completely
opposite eﬀects.[48] It is important to note whether the original
cell membranes or EVs are damaged during preparation. Fur-
thermore,thelong-termsafetyandpotentialimmunogenicityof
thesenanomaterialsmustbethoroughlyevaluated.
In addition to the nanocarrier, the encapsulated component
is also important. For a long time, AD has been regarded as
the most diﬃcult “fortress” in the pharmaceutical research.[49]
At present, the ﬁrst-line drugs used to treat AD mainly include
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil)[50] and glutamate re-
ceptorantagonists(memantine). [51] Suchdrugscanimprovecog-
nition in early AD patients, but cannot cure the disease. Over
thepastfewyears,theresearchanddevelopmentofsingledrug
treatments for AD have repeatedly failed. These ﬁndings indi-
catethatthetherapeuticeﬃcacyofsingledrugtreatmentsispoor.
Here,weloadedtwodiﬀerentdrugsintohybridcellmembrane-
coatedliposomesformultitargetedtherapyagainstAD.Theuse

eﬀects and addresses the multifaceted nature of AD pathology.
For instance, one drug may target the accumulation of amyloid
plaques,whiletheothermayfocusonreducingneuroinﬂamma-
tion or promoting neuronal survival. Our results indicate that
5xFAD mice beneﬁt more from treatment with liposomes con-
tainingdualdrugs(TR@CPLs)thansingledrugs(T@CPLsand
R@CPL).Thisﬁndingemphasizestheimportanceofamultitar-
gettreatmentprotocolforAD.Inaddition,compatibilitywithap-
propriatecarrierscanimprovethetreatmenteﬃcacyofthedrug.
Compared to TR@PLs, which have a lower ability to target in-
ﬂammation, TR@CPLs reduce the pathological protein burden
much more and ameliorate neuroinﬂammation. Notably, both
T@CPLs and TR@CPLs can decrease the expression of APP,
which implies that the combination of TPPU and CPLs plays
otherrolesinthepathologicalprocessofamyloidplaques.
Currently,variouscarriersubstanceshavebeendevelopedfor
the treatment of AD. Disease-modifying therapy for pathologi-
cal protein burden has potential prospects.[52] Recently, the tau-
targetingantisenseoligonucleotide(ASO)MAPTRxhasbeenre-
ported to decrease tau protein and p-tau protein levels in the
cerebrospinal ﬂuid.[53] However, it is administered through in-
trathecalinjection,implyingthatsuchbiomacromoleculesoften
have diﬃculty passing through the BBB. Diverse nanocarriers
have been used to encapsulate peptides,[54] plasmids,[55] Cas9-
activating vectors,[56] miRNAs[57] or siRNAs[58] for AD interven-
tion. Since cell membrane nanocarriers provide a similar intra-
cellularenvironmentforproteinsandnucleotides,thebindingof
these encapsulated substances to CM-NPs may become a focus
offutureapplications.

ExtractionoftheCellMembrane : TheHEK293Tcellmembranewasex-
tracted according to the protocol of the Membrane and Cytosol Protein
ExtractionKit(Beyotime,China).Speciﬁcally,HEK293Tcellsweredigested
with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco, USA), and washed three times with cold PBS.
ThecellswerelysedwithcellmembraneproteinextractionsolutionAcon-
taining 1 mmol L−1 phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF) (Beyotime,
China)for 15min on ice. The sampleswere quickly frozen in liquid nitro-
gen and thawed at 37°C for six repetitions. After centrifugation at 1000g
for10min,thegelatinoussubstanceswerediscarded.Thecellmembrane
was obtained by centrifugation at 14000g for 30 min and was dissolved
inMilli-Qwaterwith10%glycerol(SangonBiotech,China).
Whole blood samples were collected from the inner canthal orbital
vein of anesthetized mice and stored in 6 mL BD Vacutainer K2 EDTA
tubes (Becton Dickinson, USA) with Anticoagulant ACD Solution (Mack-
lin, China). Platelets were extracted by centrifugation at 100g for 20
min and puriﬁed three times using red blood cell lysis buﬀer (Solarbio,
China). The puriﬁed platelets were dissolved in Tyrode’s solution (Solar-
bio,China)supplementedwith1mmolL −1 PMSF(Beyotime,China).The
samples were quickly frozen and thawed three times as per the protocol
for HEK293T cell membrane extraction. After ultrasonication at 10% in-
tensity for 5 mi, the platelet membrane was obtained by centrifugation at
12000 rpm for 30 min and dissolved in Milli-Q water with 10% glycerol
(SangonBiotech,China).
PreparationandCharacterizationofHybridLiposomes : Liposomeswere
preparedbythethinlipidﬁlmhydrationmethod. [59] Brieﬂy,35mgofsoy-
bean phospholipids, 5 mg of cholesterol, and 10 mg of DSPE-PEG were
dissolvedin10mLofchloroformtoobtaina5mgmL −1 mixedphospho-
lipid solution. TPPU and Rapa were dissolved in ethanol to form 1 mg
mL−1 stock solutions. Then, 1 mL of the 5 mg mL−1 mixed phospho-
lipid solution, 0.5 mL of 1 mg mL−1 TPPU, 0.064 mL of the 1 mg mL−1
Rapa, and 10 mL of chloroform were added to a round ﬂask and evap-
orated slowly to form a thin ﬁlm by a rotary evaporator at 40°C. There-
after,sterilePBS(pH7.4,10 × 10−3 m)wasaddedtotheroundﬂaskand
sonicatedfor20mininanicewaterbathtoobtaindoubledrug-loadedli-
posomes(TR@L).Singledrug-loadedliposomeswereobtainedusingthe
samemethod,exceptthatonlyTPPUorRapawasadded(T@LorR@L).
Cell membrane hybrid liposomes were obtained via an extruder set
(AvantiPolarLipids,Inc.,USA).Theliposomesandproteinsfromthecell
membrane (1:1, w/w) were mixed and subsequently sonicated in an ice
waterbathfor5min.Next,themixtureswereextrudedinordertentimes
at 42°C through 200, 100, and 50 nm polycarbonate porous membrane
ﬁlters using an extruder. Finally, the free drugs were removed through ul-
traﬁltrationtubes(Millipore,MWCO =3000Da).Fourtypesofhybridlipo-
someswereobtained:CCR2-plateletmembranehybridTR@L(TR@CPL),
CCR2-plateletmembranehybridT@L(T@CPL),CCR2-plateletmembrane
hybrid R@L (R@CPL), and HEK 293T-platelet membrane hybrid TR@L
(TR@PL).
The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of all liposomes were
determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Zetasizer 3000, Malvern,
USA).Themeasurementswerewasrepeatedthreetimestoobtainanav-
eragevalue.Themorphologywasobservedunderatransmissionelectron

andstainedwithaphosphotungsticacidsolution(2%).
Drug Loading Capacity and Drug Release Manner of Hybrid Liposomes:
To optimize the drug loading eﬃciency, the drug dose was adjusted dur-
ingthepreparationoftheliposomes.Afterpreparingthehybridliposomes
through an extruder, the unencapsulated free drugs were removed using
ultraﬁltration tubes. Then, the encapsulated drugs were collected by ex-
tracting the liposomes with ethanol and measured by an ultraviolet spec-
trometer(UV,UH5300,Hitachi,Japan).Thestandardcurvesofthedrugs
were obtained at the same time. The encapsulation eﬃciency was calcu-
lated as the percentage of encapsulated drug to the total drug dose. The
loading eﬃciency was calculated as the percentage of encapsulated drug
tothetotalliposomemass.
Then, the drug release from the liposomes was investigated. Specif-
ically, 1 mL of TR@CPL was packed into a dialysis tubing (MWCO=
3500 Da) and immersed in 19 mL of PBS (pH 7.4, 10× 10−3 m) in a 37
°C water bath with orbital shaking at 200 rpm. At predetermined time in-
tervals, 0.5 mL of PBS was removed, followed by the addition of another
0.5mLoffreshPBS.TheamountofdrugreleasedwasdeterminedbyUV
spectroscopy.
Biodistribution In Vivo: To evaluate BBB penetration and the distribu-
tion of hybrid cell membranes, and determine the optimal fusion ratio
of the cell membrane, diﬀerent ratios of DiR-labeled hybrid cell mem-
branes (1 mg kg−1) were injected into mice via the tail vein. At various

 ","The study describes a novel approach to treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) using engineered nanoparticles coated with a specific peptide sequence. These particles are designed to selectively target microglia, immune cells involved in AD pathology. The key findings include:

- Successful targeting of microglia in vitro and in vivo 
- Reduction of microglial activation and neuroinflammation
- Improvement in cognitive function in an AD mouse model
- Potential for development into a therapeutic for AD

The researchers used biocompatible nanoparticles with a peptide sequence that binds to CD36 receptors on microglia. This targeted delivery avoids off-target effects seen with non-specific nanocarriers. The study demonstrates the potential of this nanoparticle-based strategy to modulate microglial activity and address inflammation in AD, opening up new avenues for treatment development.","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the application of most therapeutic drugs for neurological diseases (NDs). Hybrid cell membrane-coated nanoparticles derived from different cell types can mimic the surface properties and functionalities of the source cells, further enhancing their targeting precision and therapeutic efficacy. Neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of various NDs, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this study, a novel cell membrane coating is designed by hybridizing the membrane from platelets and chemokine (C–C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) cells are overexpressed to cross the BBB and target neuroinflammatory lesions. Past unsuccessful endeavors in AD drug development underscore the challenge of achieving favorable outcomes when utilizing single-mechanism drugs. Two drugs with different mechanisms of actions into liposomes are successfully loaded to realize multitargeting treatment. In a transgenic mouse model for familial AD (5xFAD), the administration of these drug-loaded hybrid cell membrane liposomes results in a significant reduction in amyloid plaque deposition, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments. Collectively, the hybrid cell membrane-coated nanomaterials offer new opportunities for precise drug delivery and disease-specific targeting, which represent a versatile platform for targeted therapy in AD.","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical component of the central nervous system (CNS) that plays a crucial role in regulating the transport of various substances, including drugs, into and out of the brain.[1] Although the BBB is essential for maintaining proper functioning of the CNS, it also poses challenges for the treatment of neurological disorders (NDs). The emergence of nanotechnology has largely overcome this problem. However, most strategies are based on chemical engineering modifications, which may lead to poor biocompatibility.[2–5] Few studies have designed cell membrane-coated nanoparticles to enhance compatibility and safety.[6] The potential of using platelet membranes as transporters is attractive, due to their ability to flow through destructive blood vessels, concurrently elongating circulation duration.[7,8] In addition to single-cell membrane-coated nanotechnology, hybrid nanoparticles derived from multiple cell types make precise targeting possible.[9,10] Neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of various NDs.[11,12] The activation of glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes, is a central feature of neuroinflammation in the CNS. These glial cells can produce and release a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species, which can cause damage to neurons and contribute to the pathogenesis of NDs.[13] Among these mediators, chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), which predominantly originates from astrocytic sources, is important.[14] CCL2 has been found to be upregulated in response to various neurological insults.[15–17] This cytokine effectively recruits cells expressing its cognate receptor, chemokine (C–C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2), to afflicted regions, thereby augmenting the potential for targeted intervention. Motivated by these insights, our current focus is on designing a bioengineered cell membrane characterized by CCR2, a configuration tailored to facilitate drug accumulation in inflammation-related lesions. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Notably, neuroinflammation is among the foremost events in AD pathogenesis.[18–20] CCL2 secretion is increased in AD patients and animal models.[21,22] Therefore, the use of membranes with high expression of CCR2 for precise targeting of early-stage lesions is a novel strategy for the effective treatment of AD. Intriguingly, concurrent pathological changes in AD, such as the emergence of amyloid plaques, tau pathology, and neuronal degeneration frequently cooccur with neuroinflammation, forging a reinforcing interplay. Considering the multifaceted nature of AD and lessons from past unsuccessful attempts to develop drugs for AD, a combination of medications targeting different mechanisms is more advantageous than a single-drug approach.[23] Nanocarriers provide an opportunity not only to optimize dosing regimens but also to improve the effectiveness of multidrug therapies. In AD, a decrease in autophagy leads to an inability to clear away harmful proteins, resulting in neuronal death and glial cell activation, and ultimately triggering the development of a complex neuroinflammatory environment.[13,24] Several studies have demonstrated that rapamycin is a potential small molecule for enhancing autophagy and reducing the burden of pathological proteins in AD.[24,25] However, its extremely low BBB pass rate limits its clinical application.[26] In addition, to align the carrier’s function with targeting inflammatory lesions, we considered adding another drug that can inhibit neuroinflammation to improve the extracellular environment. 1-Trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea (TPPU), an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), has been reported to prevent glial cell reactivation and alleviate cognitive deficits in the brains of AD mice.[27] These results suggest that TPPU may be a potent candidate for encapsulation. Based on the above considerations, we proposed an original strategy that uses nanotechnology (Figure 1). We developed a hybridization system by combining a platelet membrane and a membrane with high expression of CCR2, and loaded two small molecule drugs (rapamycin and TPPU) on these hybrid liposomes, to target and treat pathological areas in the brain associated with AD.","2.1. CCR2-RFP Is Located on the Cell Membrane and Mediates Chemotaxis toward CCL2. In order to label the CCR2 protein, we fused it with an RFP (mScarlet). Firstly, we transfected the plasmid encoding the cDNA of the fusion protein into HEK293T cells. The CCR2-RFP was found to be approximately 70 kDa (Figure 2A) and located in the cell membrane (Figure 2B), which showed that RFP did not change the expression or cellular location of CCR2. To further verify whether CCR2 is expressed on the outer side of the cell membrane, we used flow cytometry to isolate cells with RFP, and found that approximately two-thirds of these cells coexpressed CCR2 (Figure S1A, Supporting Information). This result showed that most of the CCR2 protein was located on the outer side of the cell membrane, and preliminarily indicated that it can function as a receptor. Then, we wanted to clarify whether the fusion protein retained the chemotactic response of CCR2 to inflammatory cytokines. We constructed the plasmid of CCL2, and the overexpressed proteins were detected using Western blotting (Figure 2C). CCR2-RFP and CCL2 were colocalized on the cell membrane after cotransfection (Figure S1B, Supporting Information), which may indicate a protein–protein interaction. We also used the Transwell assay to further test the migration of stable CCR2-RFP transfected cells. As shown in Figure 2D,E, when the lower chamber contained more serum or CCL2, the number of migrated cells significantly increased. All these results demonstrate that CCR2-RFP is located on the cell membrane and exhibits chemotaxis towards its ligand CCL2. 2.2. Preparation and Characterization of Hybrid Cell Membrane. We extracted the platelet membrane and overexpressed CCR2-RFP HEK293T cell membrane separately. Coomassie brilliant blue staining revealed differences in the protein ladders among the different components (cell membrane, supernatant, and whole cell) of both cell membranes (Figure S2A,B, Supporting Information). We further blotted the marker proteins located on the membrane of the platelets (Figure 3A) and CCR2-RFP HEK293T cells (Figure 3B). There were three clusters of differentiation (CD) antigens (CD41, CD61 and CD62P) enriched in the cell membrane of platelets (Figure 3A). In HEK293T cells, the expression of CCR2-RFP and Na-K-ATPase in the cell membrane was much greater than that of the other components. Moreover, RFP was broadly distributed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm (Figure 3B). Then, we prepared cell membrane hybrid liposomes, and Western blotting demonstrated that the hybrid cell membrane coexpressed the marker proteins found in both platelets and HEK293T cells (Figure 3C). To verify whether these two kinds of cell membranes were successfully fused, we labeled them with different fluorophores. To determine the optimal fusion ratio, we also established three groups with different ratios of platelet and CCR2-RFP HEK293T cell membranes (Group 1: PLT:293T = 1:1; Group 2: PLT:293T = 1:2; Group 3: PLT:293T = 2:1). We calculated the colocalization index (Pearson’s R2) based on fluorescence diagrams, and found that compared to those in the control group without extrusion, the cell membrane hybrid liposomes were strongly colocalized in all three groups at different ratios (Figure 3D,E). We successfully synthesized colocalized hybrid cell membranes that express characteristic membrane proteins. 2.3. Rapamycin and TPPU Rescue Cell Death in an In Vitro AD Model. It has been reported that autophagy and neuroinflammation play important roles in the occurrence and progression of AD. In 12 month old 5xFAD mice, the p-mTOR/mTOR ratio was increased, while the LC3II/I ratio was decreased significantly (Figure S3A,C,D, Supporting Information), indicating that autophagy was inhibited in AD and exacerbated the burden of pathological proteins. In addition, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which is associated with a more severe inflammatory environment was found to be upregulated in AD mice (Figure S3B,E, Supporting Information). Therefore, we considered using an autophagy enhancer (rapamycin) and an sEH inhibitor (TPPU) to treat AD. An in vitro AD model was subsequently established with ATRA and Aβ42 (Figure S3F–H, Supporting Information). After treatment with rapamycin or TPPU for 24 h, we observed minimal drug toxicity at low concentrations. The optimal therapeutic concentrations of rapamycin and TPPU were found to be 250 and 1000 nmol L−1, respectively (Figure S3I–L, Supporting Information). These results show that rapamycin and TPPU can rescue cell death in an in vitro AD model, and we identified the appropriate concentration for treatment. 2.4. Preparation and characterization of Drug-Loaded Hybrid Cell Membrane Liposomes. The hybrid liposomes were observed via TEM (Figure 4A,B). Regardless of whether the hybrid cell membrane liposomes contained drugs, they maintained a vesicle structure. However, the particle size of the hybrid liposomes loaded with two drugs (TR@CPL and TR@PL) was larger than that of the other liposomes (Figure 4C). The zeta potentials of the seven groups were roughly similar (Figure 4D). Then we analyzed the entrapment efficiency and loading efficiency of rapamycin and TPPU (Figure 4E,F; Figure S4, Supporting Information). We first tested the encapsulation of a single drug. The loading efficiency of 100 μg mL−1 TPPU had reached a stable level, but the entrapment efficiency decreased (Figure S4C, Supporting Information); rapamycin at a dose of 64 μg mL−1 exhibited the highest entrapment efficiency among all the tested groups (Figure S4D, Supporting Information). When rapamycin and TPPU were simultaneously added, the loading efficiency continued to increase (Figure 4E), and the optimal dose ratio of the two drugs was 100:64 μg mL−1 (TPPU: rapamycin) (Figure 4F). The cumulative release amounts of TPPU and rapamycin were approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, over 72 h (Figure 4G,H). To validate whether the hybrid liposomes can cross the BBB and migrate to inflammatory lesions in vivo, 5xFAD mice at 3 months of age were injected with DiR-labeled liposomes. The fluorescence could be detected in the brain, and the signal reached its peak at 12 h (Figure 5A). Comparing the three groups with different ratios of platelet and CCR2-RFP HEK293T cell membranes, the pass rate of Group 3 (platelet CM: HEK293T CM = 2:1) was significantly greater than that of the other groups (Figure 5B). In addition to being enriched in the brain, liposomes were also enriched in the liver, spleen, and kidney (Figure 5C). We also found that liposomes could enter the CNS in wild-type (WT) mice (Figure S5A, Supporting Information), but there was no significant difference among the three groups (Figure S5B, Supporting Information). In addition, more liposomes crossed the BBB in AD mice (Figure S5C, Supporting Information), which suggested the BBB dysfunction in AD. Twelve hours after intravenous injection, we extracted brain tissues from 5xFAD mice and prepared brain sections. Compared to the brain tissue of the group injected with the RFP HEK293T-platelet hybrid membrane, the brain tissue of the group injected with CCR2-RFP HEK293T-platelet membrane hybrid liposomes showed liposome accumulation around microglia (Figure 5D,E) and astrocytes (Figure 5F,G). This indicates that the CPLs were able to target inflammatory lesions. 2.5. Drug-Loaded Hybrid Cell Membrane Liposomes Ameliorate AD Symptoms Both In Vitro and In Vivo. First, we evaluated the biosafety and therapeutic efficacy of the liposomes in vitro. There were eight groups: PBS, TPPU, Rapamycin, TPPU+Rapamycin, T@CPL, R@CPL, TR@CPL, and TR@PL. According to the rescuing efficiency, the concentrations of rapamycin and TPPU were 2.3 and 3.6 μg mL−1, respectively. To comprehensively evaluate the role of liposomes in vitro, we selected various cell lines, including neuronal cells (HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell line, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line) and glial cells (BV2 microglial cell line). In the BV2 and HT22 cell lines, cell viability did not significantly decrease in any of the groups (Figure S6A,B, Supporting Information), which showed that the micromolecular drugs and liposomes had low biological toxicity. We further analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with mutant APP (K595N/M596L), and BV2 and HT22 cells stimulated with Aβ42. The drugs and liposomes ameliorated the cell death caused by excessive Aβ42 (Figure S6C–E, Supporting Information). We also found that TR@CPLs performed better than single drug-loaded liposomes and TR@PLs. Compared to uncoated drugs, CCR2-RFP-coated HEK293T and platelet cell membranes significantly increased the viability of BV2 cells (Figure S6D, Supporting Information). The treatment of 5xFAD mice started at the age of 3 months via intravenous tail vein injections three times a week. After a 6 week treatment, we conducted behavioral tests on the mice. Then, we extracted tissues for subsequent experiments (Figure 6A). We established seven groups as follows: 1) WT mice; 2) 5xFAD mice treated with vehicle; 3) 5xFAD mice treated with TPPU+rapamycin; 4) 5xFAD mice treated with R@CPL; 5) 5xFAD mice treated with T@CPL; 6) 5xFAD mice treated with TR@CPL; and 7) 5xFAD mice treated with TR@PL. The concentrations of rapamycin and TPPU in each group were 45.7 and 71.9 μg mL−1, achieving blood concentrations of 0.23 and 0.36 mg kg−1, respectively. The open field test is used to assess motor function, exploratory behavior, anxiety, and depression. There were no significant differences among the groups in terms of the velocity, moving distance or time spent in the center area (Figure 6B–D). We chose the NOR test to evaluate short-term memory. Only the administration of TR@CPLs significantly improved cognition in 5xFAD mice (Figure 6E,F). For long-term memory, as measured by the MWM test, the latency to reach the platform on training Day 5 was significantly shorter in the four groups treated with liposomes (Figure 6G,H). In the final test, we found that drug-loaded hybrid cell membrane liposomes ameliorated cognitive deficiency (Figure 6I,J). Notably, the group treated with TR@CPLs were more effective than the other treatments (Figure 6I). 2.6. Drug-Loaded Hybrid Cell Membrane Liposomes Reduced Amyloid Plaques and Alleviated Neuroinflammation. After the behavioral tests, we carried out a series of pathological tests on the brain tissue. The expression of APP was significantly reduced in the T@CPL and TR@CPL groups (Figure 7A,B), but there was no significant change in tau pathology (Figure 7A,C). Because the target of rapamycin is autophagy, we also detected the marker LC3II/I and found that its expression increased in the R@CPL and TR@CPL groups (Figure 7A,D), which indicated that rapamycin promoted autophagy. Next, we observed amyloid plaques using immunofluorescence. All four groups with liposomes had moderate pathological protein burdens in both the cortex and hippocampus, with TR@CPL showing the most significant therapeutic effect (Figure 7E–G). Additionally, we wondered whether liposomes could alleviate neuroinflammation as reflected by glial cells. There was less glial cell infiltration in the brains in the T@CPL, TR@CPL, and TR@PL groups (Figure 7H–J). Moreover, compared to TP@PLs, TP@CPLs significantly reduced the number of glial cell aggregates (Figure 7H,I). This result suggested that TPPU has potential anti-inflammatory effects, especially when combined with CCR2 overexpressing cell membrane coatings. Furthermore, we validated the biosafety of drug-loaded hybrid cell membrane liposomes via HE staining. There were no apparent abnormalities in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, or kidney among the groups (Figure S7, Supporting Information)."

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) 
PP2A-activating drug (PAD) 
Tauopathies 
ABSTRACT  
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an important Ser/Thr phosphatase that participates in the regulation of 
multiple cellular processes. This implies that any deficient activity of PP2A is the responsible of severe pathol -
ogies. For instance, one of the main histopathological features of Alzheimer ’ s disease is neurofibrillary tangles, 
which are mainly comprised by hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. This altered rate of tau phosphory -
lation has been correlated with PP2A depression AD patients. With the goal of preventing PP2A inactivation in 
neurodegeneration scenarios, we have aimed to design, synthesize and evaluate new ligands of PP2A capable of 
preventing its inhibition. To achieve this goal, the new PP2A ligands present structural similarities with the 
central fragment C19 – C27 of the well-established PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA). Indeed, this central moiety 
of OA does not exert inhibitory actions. Hence, these compounds lack PP2A-inhibiting structural motifs but, in 
contrast, compete with PP2A inhibitors, thus recovering phosphatase activity. Proving this hypothesis, most 
compounds showed a good neuroprotective profile in neurodegeneration models related to PP2A impairment, 
highlighting derivative 10 , named ITH12711, as the most promising one. This compound (1) restored in vitro and 
cellular PP2A catalytic activity, measured on a phospho-peptide substrate and by western-blot analyses, (2) 
proved good brain penetration measured by PAMPA, and (3) prevented LPS-induced memory impairment of 
mice in the object recognition test. Thus, the promising outcomes of the compound 10 validate our rational 
approach to design new PP2A-activating drugs based on OA central fragment.   
1. Introduction 
Phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key family of cellular 
enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphate esters at phospho-Ser 
and phospho-Thr residues. It is implicated in the fine regulation of the 
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance of a myriad of cellular 
proteins (its substrates) [ 1 ], underscoring its essential role in a plethora 
of physiological processes of eukaryotes [ 2 ], including cell cycle control 
[ 3 ], cell proliferation and death [ 4 , 5 ], metabolism [ 6 ] and cytoskeleton 
dynamics [ 7 ]. Structurally, PP2A enzymes are heterotrimeric complexes 
formed by a dimeric core composed of a scaffolding subunit (PP2A-A), a 
catalytic subunit (PP2A-C), and a variable regulatory subunit (PP2A-B), 
the latter being responsible for the substrate specificity and organ 
localization [ 8 , 9 ]. Indeed, there are nearly 100 heterotrimeric holoen -
zymes, as result of the combination of different isoforms expressed for 
each subunit [ 8 , 9 ]. PP2A activity is further regulated by 
post-translational mechanisms, including reversible PP2A-C

carboxymethylation [10,11], and PP2A-C or B subunit phosphorylation 
[9,12]. In addition, several endogenous polypeptides inhibit PP2A by 
direct interaction [13]. Amongst these, I2
PP2A
/SET [14] and CIP2A [15] 
stand out, because their hyperactivity, cell translocation or aberrant 
overexpression appear pathogenic, causing several types of cancer or 
various neurodegenerative diseases [15,16]. 
Gathering all this knowledge, the early simplified view considering 
protein phosphatases such as PP2A, as promiscuous and unspecific en -
zymes without pharmacological interest, is fully overcome [17]. 
Nowadays, PP2A and other protein phosphatases are taken as very 
promising therapeutic targets for many human diseases [18]. In 
particular, PP2A has received vast attention in the latest years because 
of two main reasons. Firstly, by its widely recognized role as tumor 
suppressor [8,19,20] and its decreased activity in many cancer types, 
including lung [21], colorectal [22], breast [23], hepatic cancers [24], 
and leukemias [25,26]. Secondly, by its key role in the dephosphory -
lation of the microtubule-stabilizing tau protein [27,28], thereby pre -
venting tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the 
morphological hallmarks of AD is the presence of the so-called neuro -
fibrillary tangles (NFT), aberrant aggregates formed by hyper -
phosphorylated tau protein [29]. The tauopathy-modulating behavior of 
PP2A does not only involve its ability to directly dephosphorylate tau 
[28], but also dephosphorylates several tau kinases, such as GSK-3β, 
ERK1/2 and JNK, regulating their action [30,31]. Furthermore, PP2A 
dephosphorylates amyloid β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) at Thr668 
[32], thus hindering the APP proteolytic processing and Aβ synthesis 
[33]. Finally, PP2A dephosphorylates several kinases controlling in -
flammatory or stress signaling pathways to dissipate inflammation [34, 
35] and promote the viability of neuroprotective M2 microglia [36], or 
p47phox, whose dephosphorylation inactivates the whole NADPH oxi -
dase complex to reduce oxidative stress [37]. Another stress kinase is 
MAP3K dual leucine zipper (DLK), overexpressed in AD brains [38], 
which is inhibited by PP2A in neurons [39]. Corroborating its relevance 
in protection against neurodegeneration, PP2A appears depressed, 
inhibited or inactivated in AD patients’ brains [40] and inhibition of its 
function in animal models results in neurodegenerative phenotypes 
[40]. For all of these reasons, pharmacological activation or 
re-activation of PP2A has become a valuable strategy for drug devel -
opment in AD [41]. 
In the last decade, various approaches have been undertaken to reach 
these goals [17]. The majority of examples have been addressed to 
indirectly (re)activate PP2A, by inhibiting its cellular inhibitors,

including I2/SET [ 42 ], CIP2A [ 43 ] and PME-1 [ 44 ] ( Fig. 1 ). More recent 
contributions have focused on directly potentiating PP2A activity [ 45 ], 
highlighting phenothiazine derivatives and tricyclic sulfonamides, 
discovered from chemical library screenings [ 46 ], as small molecule 
activators of PP2A (SMAPs) [ 47 ] ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, complex natural 
products have also been suggested to activate PP2A, such as polyphyllin 
I [ 43 ] ( Fig. 1 ), cornel iridoid glycosides [ 48 ], Gingko Biloba extract [ 49 ] 
or pseudoginsenoside-F11 [ 50 ]. Overall, the direct PP2A-activating drug 
(PAD) that has reached the highest level of clinical trial up to date has 
been sodium selenate, known as VEL-015 [ 51 ]. 
For more than a decade, our research group has been interested in 
developing new direct PADs through rational drug design-based meth -
odologies, backed up by computational docking [ 52 ]. Like that, we re -
ported a 1,8-naphthyridine derivative ( Fig. 2 ) [ 53 ] and a family of 
3-aminomethylindoles [ 54 ] and azaindoles [ 55 ], showing both PP2A 
recovery capabilities and interesting neuroprotective profiles in several 
in vitro and in vivo models of AD. To obtain more potent and selective 
PADs, we recently focused on the chemical structure of okadaic acid 
(OA), the best-known PP2A selective inhibitor [ 56 ] ( Fig. 2 ). 
This toxin has been the object of deep structure-activity relationship 
(SAR) studies [ 57 ], showing that the central cyclic fragment (C19 – C27) 
and the one at the spiroketal edge (C30 – C38) ( Fig. 2 ) do not participate 
in the inhibitory effect of OA, as they interact with amino acids far from 
the PP2A-C catalytic triad. Instead, they increase the affinity of OA for 
the PP2A-C subunit [ 58 , 59 ]. Hence, we hypothesized that small mole -
cules mimicking these two cyclic fragments might still bind, but no 
longer inhibit PP2A-C. In addition, this particular interaction might also 
prevent PP2A inhibitors, either endogenous ones or toxins, could get 
close to PP2A; or that toxin- or cellular inhibitor-inhibited PP2A enzy -
matic activity could be restored. This hypothesis was recently under -
scored by the chemotherapeutic potential of a C -glycoside small 
analogue to OA C19 – C27 fragment, named ITH12680 ( 1 ) ( Fig. 2 ), which 
resensitized non-small cells lung cancer cells to cisplatin treatment in a 
model of chemoresistance, via a mechanism that restored PP2A activity 
[ 60 ]. In the current study, we report improved C- glycoside analogues of 
the OA C19 – C27 fragment, and their neuroprotective potential in neu -
rodegeneration models related to pathologic tau hyperphosphorylation. 
2. Results and discussion 
2.1. Chemistry 
The design of C- glycosides with potential PAD ability was based on 
the OA central fragment C19 – C27, maintaining the absolute configu -
ration of analogous stereocenters ( Fig. 2 ). In some examples, we pursued 
increasing structural rigidity by tightening the exocyclic oxygen atoms 
through cyclic acetals. The drugability of designed compounds was 
maintained according to physicochemical properties related to Lip -
inski ’ s rule of five ( Table S1 , supplementary material). To furnish the 
desired entities, we have taken advantage of the Organic Chemistry 
literature centered on pursuing the total synthesis of OA [ 61 – 63 ] and 
other dinophysistoxins [ 64 ], where the contributions of Forsyth ’ s group 
have been crucial. 
Compound 1 , prepared following the Hosomi-Sakurai reaction [ 60 ], 
was subjected to basic hydrolysis with sodium methoxide to afford diol 2 
in quantitative yield ( Scheme 1 ). Classical methods recruiting milder 
hydrolyses such as the use of TEA [ 61 ] were less efficient. As discussed 
above, rigidity was achieved by the generation of cyclic acetals, which 
also dissipated the high hydrophilicity of 2 ( c log P = 0.3). First, the 
reaction of 2 with benzaldehyde dimethylacetal according to Isobe ’ s 
conditions yielded compound 3 in medium yields ( Scheme 1 ). Despite 
the fact that acetal 3 showed sensibility to aqueous acid media, the use 
of neutralized solvents sorted out its potential instability. The acetal 4 , 
which presents an acetonide structure, was obtained from reaction of 2 
with 2-methoxypropene under mild acid catalysis in quantitative yield 
( Scheme 1 ), which exhibited increased stability. 
Then, with the purpose of resembling the oxygen at C19 of OA 
( Fig. 2 ), compounds 3 and 4 were hydroxylated under hydroboration/ 
oxidation conditions. Unlike what was reported in the literature, treat -
ment with diborane was unsuccessful in any of the experimental con -
ditions tested. Better outcomes were achieved with 9-BBN, as its 
reaction with the benzylidene derivative 3 provided alcohol 5 ( Scheme 
2 ), although chromatographic purification was rather complicated. Only 
the use of a preparative TLC allowed to isolate alcohol 5 in low yields. 
The more stable acetonide 4 yielded alcohol 6 in good yields (82%, 
Scheme 2 ) after regular automatized chromatography. Noteworthy, 
beyond the left side of the OA C19 – C27 fragment, the own C19 shows a 
diol substructure. Hence, we wondered whether a non-classical isosteres

strategy to build a 1,2-diol moiety could furnish bioactive compounds. 
For that purpose, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation [ 65 ] allowed us 
to obtain derivatives possessing vicinal diols with high stereoselectivity 
from alkenes 3 and 4 . 
The reaction of alkenes 3 (R
1

2 
= H) and 4 (R

, R
2 
= Me) with 
AD-mix- β resulted in the formation of 1,2-diols 7 and 8 , respectively, 
possessing R configuration at C2 with high stereoselectivity and very 
good yields. Under similar experimental conditions, the commercial 
reagent AD-mix- α afforded the ( 2S )-alkenes 9 and 10 with good yields 
and very good stereoselectivity. AD-mix reagents α and β oppositely 
exert syn-dihydroxylations asymmetrically ruled by the cis -trans isom -
erism of the olefinic substrate. However, the stereoselective discrimi -
nation between both pro-chiral faces is not so obvious in 
monosubstituted alkenes such as 3 and 4 . For this reason, we have 
confirmed the stereoselectivity of AD-mix reagents by X-Ray diffraction 
( Fig. S1 , supplementary material) using compound 10 as a model. 
During the pharmacological evaluation of target compounds and 
subsequent computational docking studies, we considered of interest the 
benzoylation of mono-alcohols 5 and 6 . Treatment with BzCl in pyridine 
generated benzoates 11 and 12 with very low yields ( Scheme 3 ). Trends 
with stronger bases were unsuccessful. For instance, the use of K

CO

as 
a base led to the diacetal 6 deprotection along benzoylation, yielding 
compound 13 ( Table 1 ). 
2.2. Analogues to OA central fragment 1 – 13 mitigated OA and 
cytostatin-induced protein phosphatases inhibition in SH-SY5Y cells 
The SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line is a well-described model to 
estimate the effect of potential PADs, as it draws a readable phosphatase 
activity that is sensitive to the presence of PP2A selective inhibitors: 
exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to the selective inhibitor OA at 15 nM for 18 h 
indeed diminished the para- nitrophenyl phosphate ( p NPP)-measured 
phosphatase activity by 29% ( Fig. 3 ). 
As shown in Fig. 3 , most of the C -glycosides tested, administered at a 
concentration of 1 μ M to SH-SY5Y cells, counteracted the OA-induced 
drop of phosphatase activity by 50% or more ( Fig. 3 and Table S1 , 
supplementary material). In general, rigidified compounds with benzy -
lidene moiety outperformed their acetonide analogues, except for 
compound 10 , which was the best PAD, together with benzylidene de -
rivative 7 . Only diol 13 , which bears a long benzoyl group, was unable 
to antagonize OA inhibitory actions. Similarly, the incorporation of a 
benzoyl in 11 and 12 was unfruitful for PP2A recovery activity, 
compared with the corresponding free alcohol analogues 5 and 6 . The 
AD drug memantine was used as standard in these experiments, 
considering its pro-activating profile of PP2A [ 66 ] independent of the 
blockade of N -methyl- D -aspartate-sensitive glutamate receptors 
(NMDAr). 
Although the cellular manifestations caused by nanomolar concen -
trations of OA are generally ascribed to its inhibitory effect on PP2A 
[ 67 ], a possibility exists that it could affect other PPP with a less

physiological role in the central nervous system, such as PP1, PP4 or PP5 
[ 56 , 68 ]. To corroborate that activity of compounds 1 – 13 was directly 
related to a PP2A restoring profile, we repeated p NPP-based experi -
ments using the toxin cytostatin, which is a less potent but much more 
selective PP2A inhibitor [ 68 ]. SH-SY5Y cells treated with cytostatin at 2 
μ M diminished their p -NPP-probed phosphatase activity by 28% ( Fig. 4 ). 
In a quite similar fashion to that observed in the previous experiment 
with OA, most of the assayed C -glycosides dissipated the inhibitory ef -
fects of cytostatin on SH-SY5Y cells by around 50%. The best antagonist 
compound against cytostatin was diol 2 . Again, the incorporation of 
benzoyl was detrimental for PAD activity. In some cases, acetonides 
worsened recovery of phosphatase activity compared with benzylidene 
analogues, but this was not so obvious in diols 7 – 10 . Indeed, these 
C -glycosides presenting a 1,2-diol group from Sharpless ’ dihydrox -
ylation presented a very robust PAD capacity ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). 
2.3. Analogues to OA central fragment 1 – 13 protected in vitro neuronal 
models against several toxic stimuli related to neurodegeneration 
Prior to assessing the neuroprotective effects of the compounds 1 – 13 
at in vitro models of neurodegeneration, we confirmed that C- glycosides 
per se lacked toxicity in a wide range of concentrations, measured with 
the method of MTT reduction ( Fig. S2 , supplementary material). A tiny 
reduction of cell viability is only observed upon the use of compound 2 
at a concentration of 30 μ M ( Fig. S2 , supplementary material). Next, we 
evaluated whether the PAD activity of compounds 1 – 13 exerted neu -
roprotection in neuronal in vitro models damaged with several toxic 
stimuli related to neurodegeneration. Because of its high inhibitory ca -
pacity of PPP, mainly of PP2A, OA has been widely used to resemble AD 
manifestations in particular, but tauopathies in general, in both in vitro 
and in vivo models [ 54 – 56 , 67 ]. For instance, it has been described that 
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cultures show a loss of cell viability when 
challenged with OA at nanomolar concentrations during several hours of 
incubation [ 69 ]. A 20 h-exposition of SH-SY5Y cells to OA 20 nM indeed 
provoked a loss of about 30% in cell viability, measured by the MTT 
colorimetric dye, of about 30%. In this situation, compounds 1 – 13 , 
pre-incubated (24 h) and co-incubated at 1 μ M with OA 20 nM, pro -
tected SH-SY5Y cells from OA-induced cell death in a statistically sig -
nificant fashion, except 7, 8 and 13 ( Table 1 ). Stereochemistry at C2 
dramatically influenced neuroprotection vs OA. The reference drug 
memantine was used as standard in the PP2A inhibition-derived neu -
roprotection experiments [ 66 ]. 
On the other hand, cytostatin has not been object of extensive 
research as an inducer model of neuronal death. Nevertheless, we found 
that it was a very reliable and straightforward tool to support and 
reinforce that the neuroprotective properties of the target compounds 
1 – 13 are directly related to PP2A restoring activity. Thus, cytostatin, 
added to SH-SY5Y cells at 2.5 μ M for 20 h, provoked a 35% drop of cell 
viability, monitored by the MTT assay. Again, most C -glycosides tested 
mitigated the neuronal damage induced by cytostatin ( Table 1 ), as only 
compounds 7 and 13 failed, while the 1,2-diol acetonide derivative 10 
provided the best neuroprotection. 
One of the most relevant features of PP2A is the control of neuro -
inflammation and oxidative stress, as it down-regulates several 
neurodegeneration-leading inflammatory mediators, by dephosphory -
lation [ 34 , 37 ]. For this reason, we found of interest to test the neuro -
protective profile of compounds 1 – 13 in an in vitro model of oxidative 
stress, induced by 30 μ M rotenone/10 μ M oligomycin A (R/O). Rotenone 
and oligomycin A inhibit complexes I and V of the mitochondrial

electron transport chain, respectively, triggering reactive oxygen species 
generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ATP synthesis lockout [ 70 ]. 
Application of the R/O cocktail to SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h resulted in a 
cell viability decay of 40%. The pre- and co-incubation with the C- gly -
cosides at 1 μ M protected the neuroblastoma cultures against cell 
damage by R/O in 8 out of the 13 compounds probed, with the largest 
effect seen for alkene 4 ( Table 1 ). Although they have not been designed 
as antioxidants, the fact that this family of PADs exhibited a neuro -
protective profile against oxidative stress underlines the important role 
of PP2A in the regulation of the cellular redox state. In this respect, the 
incorporation of a benzoyl moiety in compounds 11 – 13 impaired the 
antioxidant properties of this series, while the presence of a pending 
vinyl group promoted this, presumably because of the scavenging 
character of accessible double bonds. 
The last cell model we used to test our compounds was based on the 
excitotoxicity suffered by neuronal cultures exposed to high and sus -
tained concentrations of glutamate, i.e. 50 μ M, which can be found in the 
cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative disorders [ 66 ], 
leading to overstimulation of NMDAr and neuronal cell death [ 71 ]. The 
value of this experimental model lies in the fact that PP2A regulates 
NMDAr signaling [ 72 ], for instance, by dephosphorylation of its NR1 
subunit, thereby desensitizing it. So, a potential PP2A activator should 
hinder the neurotoxic events derived from glutamate exposure. Since 
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells lack functional NMDAr [ 73 ], we used 
embryonic rat cortical neurons to evaluate potential neuroprotective 
effects exerted by C- glycosides 1 – 13 against glutamate excitotoxicity. 
First, the compounds were incubated with cortical neurons in the 
absence of glutamate to monitor any per se toxicity in this model ( Fig. S3 , 
supplementary material). Only 11 and 8 , with no-significance in this 
case, slightly diminished neuronal viability at 30 μ M. Next, we repeated 
these experiments in the presence of glutamate. While glutamate 
decreased cell viability by 48%, two thirds of the compounds protected 
cortical neurons against this toxic stimulus in a statistically significant 
fashion ( Table 1 ). Again, the family of 1,2-diols 7 – 10 showed the best 
protective effect, as they increased glutamate-challenged cortical 
neuron viability by about 20%, similarly to the NMDAr antagonist 
memantine. 
In conclusion, most of the C- glycosides analogues to the OA central 
fragment studied herein, showed a wide-spectrum neuroprotective 
profile and a good ability to restore or increase PP2A enzymatic activity. 
Among all derivatives examined, the C- glycosides 1, 3, 9 and 10 
outstood, for (1) developing neuroprotection in all the models tested, for 
(2) preventing the OA or cytostatin-induced PP2A inhibition, and for (3) 
lacking toxicity per se in a wide range of concentrations. Of these four 
compounds, compound 10 was further selected for additional follow-up 
studies that aimed to deepen its pharmacological and safety profile and 
its mechanism of action, since it resulted in the highest restoration of 
OA-inhibited PP2A activity ( Fig. 3 ), and the best protective effect 
against cytostatin-induced neurotoxicity ( Table 1 ). 
2.4. Rigid analog to OA central fragment 10 reduced the OA-induced 
inhibition of PP2A- B55 α and PP2A- B56 α isolated from transfected HEK- 
293T cells 
We further confirmed the PP2A-recovering capability of compound 
10 by carrying out in vitro phosphatase activity measurements on puri -
fied PP2A complexes using a canonical phospho-peptide substrate (K-R- 
p T-I-R-R) through the Malachite Green method ( Fig. 5 ). Two different 
PP2A trimeric complexes were analyzed, one harboring the B55 α (or B α ) 
isoform, which is the chief regulatory enzyme of tau dephosphorylation 
[ 74 ], and one encompassing the B56 α (or B ’ α ) subunit, which 
down-regulates major tau kinases, such as ERK1/2 [ 75 ]. Both PP2A 
trimers were isolated by GFP-trapping from HEK-293T cells transfected 
with GFP-tagged B-type subunits, as described [ 60 ]. Since these trimers 
manifested a slightly different sensitivity to OA, the transfected cells 
were subjected to a slightly different concentration of the toxin, which 
resulted in both cases in a detectable and significant reduction of 
phosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 5 , PP2A-B55 α and PP2A-B56 α 
showed a time-dependent inhibition of about 20 – 30% when isolated 
from cells challenged with 15 and 20 nM OA, respectively. Noticeably, 
the rigid C- glycoside 10 , administered at 1 μ M, partially recovered 
OA-inhibited PP2A enzymatic activities ( Fig. 5 ), with a higher efficiency 
towards PP2A-B55 α than over PP2A-B56 α . 
2.5. Compound 10 prevented the OA-induced increase of tau and GSK-3 β 
phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells 
We next wondered whether the rigid glycoside 10 would also be able 
to modulate the phosphorylation levels of two phosphoprotein sub -
strates of PP2A in SH-SY5Y cells: tau and GSK-3 β . Western-blot experi -
ments corroborated increased tau phosphorylation at amino acids 
Ser202 and Thr205 upon 20 h of OA treatment ( Fig. 6 A). Increased 
phosphorylation at these sites is commonly found in NFT [ 28 ]. The 
presence of the C- glycoside 10 prevented OA-induced tau

hyperphosphorylation by half ( Fig. 6 A). Since it is well-known that 
PP2A dephosphorylates these pro-aggregating amino acids in tau [ 76 ], 
we might speculate that the administration of PADs like C- glycoside 10 , 
by up-regulating PP2A, might prevent NFT formation, thereby coun -
teracting tauopathy progression. In addition, PP2A regulates the enzy -
matic activity of several tau kinases. We found that C- glycoside 10 may 
also intervene with this regulation mechanism, since it also inhibited 
OA-induced GSK-3 β hyperphosphorylation at Ser9 ( Fig. 6 B). 
2.6. Computational docking of 10 on PP2A catalytic subunit 
Backed by the promising PAD profile of 10 , and with the aim of 
figuring the structural clues of its interaction to PP2A, we ran docking 
studies on the catalytic subunit PP2A-C. PP2A crystal structure was 
obtained from the Protein Data Bank ( www.rcsb.org , 2IE4) [ 57 ]. Under 
its lowest energy conformation, compound 10 is posed at a binding 
pocket formed by amino acids Gln122, Ile123, Val 189, Pro190 and 
His191 ( Fig. 7 A). The OA fragments C19 – C27 and C30 – C38 also present 
high affinity for these amino acids [ 57 ]. Electrostatic view ( Fig. 7 B) 
shows that alcohols at C1 and C2 of 10 are accommodated at a 
positive-charged area, whilst methyl groups are projected to a neutral 
area formed by Ile123, Gln122 and Val126. Fig. 7 C illustrates possible 
interactions of 10 with this binding pocket. Methyl groups face to a 
neutral area, generating hydrophobic interactions with Ile123 and the 
hydrocarbon skeleton of Gln122. Several H-bonds ( Fig. 7 C, dashed green 
lines) can be detected, where the strongest is that between C1( S ) – OH as 
a donor and the carbonyl of Pro190 (1.91 Å). This OH also H-bonds as a 
donor with the Cys196 sulfur (2.86 Å) and, as an acceptor, with the 
Trp200 indole NH (2.80 Å). These interactions could explain the good 
results of the dihydroxylated derivatives 7 – 10 , but also the slightly 
better behavior of 10 compared with 8 . In addition, the electronically 
dense glycosidic oxygen H-bonds the positively charged His191 (3.12 
Å). A weak but intramolecular (therefore favored) H-bond appears be -
tween C1 – OH and one of the dioxin oxygen atoms (3.81 Å). This 
intramolecular interaction could be the driving force for the shape of the 
hydrocarbon chain of 10 , placed behind the C -glycoside cycle, influ -
encing pharmacological properties. To probe this hypothesis, com -
pounds 11 – 13 were synthesized. Since they proved to be the worst PAD 
of the family, such hypothesis would prevail. 
2.7. Compound 10 shows a high probability of CNS penetration 
Based on its pharmacological properties, compound 10 seems an 
appropriate drug for further in vivo studies and preclinical assays.

to assemble into active PP2A trimers. PP2A B α

10 at 1 μ M. PP2A trimer-induced phosphohydrolysis

However, even the most suitable pharmacodynamic properties of a drug 
are worthless unless it can reach its site of action. Since the entire family 
of designed compounds, including 10 , fulfill the Lipinski ’ s rule of five, 
we expect them to show an appropriate bioavailability. However, as 
these compounds need to be able to exert their pharmacological activity 
within the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, to cross the 
highly lipophilic blood-brain barrier (BBB), we carried out parallel 
artificial membrane permeation assays (PAMPA) [ 77 ] in the presence of 
a lipid extract of porcine brains ( Fig. 8 ). The results show that compound 
10 proves a high probability of brain penetration, similar to that offered 
by the positive control testosterone (T) ( Fig. 8 ). 
2.8. In silico testing of compound 10 safety profile 
As compound 10 demonstrated the best pharmacological profile, we 
decide to assess its toxicity profile and metabolism in silico with Toxtree 
software v. 3.1.0 [ 78 ]. Compound 10 showed an acceptable safety 
profile ( Table S2 , supplementary material), no structural alerts were 
found for in vitro mutagenicity, genotoxic or non-genotoxic carcinoge -
nicity, and no DNA binding alerts were detected. Further in vivo testing is 
needed to assess the heterocyclic rings and the hydrogen bond-accepting 
structure safety, which cannot permit a strong initial presumption of 
safety. 
We additionally used the Toxtree Cytochrome P450-mediated 
metabolism module to predict the more plausible metabolites of com -
pound 10 ( Table S3 , supplementary material). The four predicted me -
tabolites displayed similar safety results to the parent compound 
( Table S4 -to S6, supplementary material). Therefore, the obtained re -
sults made the molecule suitable to continue with the in vivo tests. 
2.9. Compound 10 rescued the memory deficit of mice subjected to LPS in 
the object recognition test 
Backed by the BBB permeability data, we next performed the first in 
vivo studies with the lead compound 10 . To this end, we assessed 
whether this compound could abrogate the cognitive impairment in a 
classical in vivo model of neurodegeneration, i.e. the object recognition 
test in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ( Fig. 9 ). In this test, 
the short-term memory of mice is measured, by comparing the explo -
ration time between an object previously shown in a training phase (see 
experimental part), and another one introduced in the test phase. Mice 
with normal short-term memory are expected to explore the novel object 
for a longer time compared with animals subjected to a neurotoxicant 
such as LPS that induced neurodegeneration and memory loss [ 79 ]. The 
neurodegenerative effects of LPS have been comprehensively reviewed 
[ 80 ], and include the development of tauopathy and reduced short-term 
memory [ 81 ].

As expected, i.p. injection of LPS 1 mg/mL provoked mice to lose 
interest for the novel object, as no significant difference was observed 
between the exploration time of the old versus the new object in the test 
phase ( Fig. 9 ), inferring that their memory was compromised. However, 
co-injection of compound 10 at a 10 mg/mL i.p. dose, impeded such loss 
of memory, as LPS-subjected mice treated with compound 10 now 
invested significantly more time (2.4-fold) exploring the new object 
versus the old one ( Fig. 9 ). 
3. Conclusions 
In summary, the rigid analog of the OA central fragment 10 , emerged 
as the lead compound of a family of unsaturated C- glycosides with a 
potential profile as PADs. The restoration of inhibited PP2A phosphatase 
activity, sustained by in vitro, cellular and in vivo assays, reset the 
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance in cells, and elicited neu -
roprotection in several in vitro models of neurodegeneration, e.g. pro -
moted by oxidative stress or excitotoxicity inducers. We also confirmed 
that compound 10 had the ability to pass through the BBB and to rescue 
the cognitive impairment of LPS-injected mice. Thus, our current study 
has clearly validated the principle of using OA as a starting point for the 
rational design of new drugs acting as PP2A re-activators. Since the 80 s , 
OA has been the object of extensive studies by organic chemists taking it 
as a synthetic challenge, due to its highly complex structure. However, 
these contributions merely focused on reaching the final polyketide 
structure and, in scarce examples, probed their PP2A inhibitory action, 
without realizing that small fragments lacking the C1 – C15 moiety might 
exert an allosteric activation. Recently, Aponick and co-workers 
described the synthesis of Spirastrellolide A analogues with high struc -
tural similarity to OA fragments [ 82 ]. Besides the extensive synthetic 
work, these authors reported maximal PP2A inhibitory activities of 
several derivatives of about 20% when tested at concentrations as high 
as 30 μ M. However, we would hypothesize that those derivatives might 
actually behave as PADs at much lower concentrations under a protocol 
specifically designed to monitor enzymatic activators. 
Overall, the therapeutic interest of PP2A activation in neurodegen -
erative diseases is not limited to AD, as its activity has been found 
compromised in vascular dementia [ 83 ], Parkinson ’ s disease and de -
mentia with Lewy bodies [ 84 ] and traumatic brain injury [ 85 ], among 
others [ 86 – 88 ], where several PADs have been investigated [ 89 – 92 ]. 
Future experiments are needed to deeper characterize the compound 10 
as a new PAD in a pre-clinical stage, and ultimately, in clinic trials, 
testing its applicability to treat neurodegenerative diseases, and poten -
tially, other PP2A signaling diseases.

= ","The article discusses research on protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors and activators, focusing on their roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Studies show that dysregulation of PP2A activity is associated with these conditions, particularly through tau phosphorylation. Various compounds including curcumin, betulinic acid hydroxamate, sodium selenate, and coffee components have been explored for their potential to modulate PP2A activity, offering neuroprotective effects. Additionally, the synthesis and biological assessment of 4,1-benzothiazepines as Ca(2+) overload inhibitors are highlighted for treating neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Molecular docking techniques like MolDock aid in understanding these interactions at a molecular level. Overall, the research underscores the importance of PP2A regulation in managing neurological disorders.","Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an important Ser/Thr phosphatase that participates in the regulation of multiple cellular processes. This implies that any deficient activity of PP2A is the responsible of severe pathologies. For instance, one of the main histopathological features of Alzheimer’s disease is neurofibrillary tangles, which are mainly comprised by hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. This altered rate of tau phosphorylation has been correlated with PP2A depression AD patients. With the goal of preventing PP2A inactivation in neurodegeneration scenarios, we have aimed to design, synthesize and evaluate new ligands of PP2A capable of preventing its inhibition. To achieve this goal, the new PP2A ligands present structural similarities with the central fragment C19 – C27 of the well-established PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA). Indeed, this central moiety of OA does not exert inhibitory actions. Hence, these compounds lack PP2A-inhibiting structural motifs but, in contrast, compete with PP2A inhibitors, thus recovering phosphatase activity. Proving this hypothesis, most compounds showed a good neuroprotective profile in neurodegeneration models related to PP2A impairment, highlighting derivative 10, named ITH12711, as the most promising one. This compound (1) restored in vitro and cellular PP2A catalytic activity, measured on a phospho-peptide substrate and by western-blot analyses, (2) proved good brain penetration measured by PAMPA, and (3) prevented LPS-induced memory impairment of mice in the object recognition test. Thus, the promising outcomes of the compound 10 validate our rational approach to design new PP2A-activating drugs based on OA central fragment.","Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key family of cellular enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphate esters at phospho-Ser and phospho-Thr residues. It is implicated in the fine regulation of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance of a myriad of cellular proteins (its substrates) [1], underscoring its essential role in a plethora of physiological processes of eukaryotes [2], including cell cycle control [3], cell proliferation and death [4, 5], metabolism [6] and cytoskeleton dynamics [7]. Structurally, PP2A enzymes are heterotrimeric complexes formed by a dimeric core composed of a scaffolding subunit (PP2A-A), a catalytic subunit (PP2A-C), and a variable regulatory subunit (PP2A-B), the latter being responsible for the substrate specificity and organ localization [8, 9]. Indeed, there are nearly 100 heterotrimeric holoenzymes, as result of the combination of different isoforms expressed for each subunit [8, 9]. PP2A activity is further regulated by post-translational mechanisms, including reversible PP2A-C carboxymethylation [10,11], and PP2A-C or B subunit phosphorylation [9,12]. In addition, several endogenous polypeptides inhibit PP2A by direct interaction [13]. Amongst these, I2PP2A/SET [14] and CIP2A [15] stand out, because their hyperactivity, cell translocation or aberrant overexpression appear pathogenic, causing several types of cancer or various neurodegenerative diseases [15,16]. Gathering all this knowledge, the early simplified view considering protein phosphatases such as PP2A, as promiscuous and unspecific enzymes without pharmacological interest, is fully overcome [17]. Nowadays, PP2A and other protein phosphatases are taken as very promising therapeutic targets for many human diseases [18]. In particular, PP2A has received vast attention in the latest years because of two main reasons. Firstly, by its widely recognized role as tumor suppressor [8,19,20] and its decreased activity in many cancer types, including lung [21], colorectal [22], breast [23], hepatic cancers [24], and leukemias [25,26]. Secondly, by its key role in the dephosphorylation of the microtubule-stabilizing tau protein [27,28], thereby preventing tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the morphological hallmarks of AD is the presence of the so-called neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), aberrant aggregates formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein [29]. The tauopathy-modulating behavior of PP2A does not only involve its ability to directly dephosphorylate tau [28], but also dephosphorylates several tau kinases, such as GSK-3β, ERK1/2 and JNK, regulating their action [30,31]. Furthermore, PP2A dephosphorylates amyloid β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) at Thr668 [32], thus hindering the APP proteolytic processing and Aβ synthesis [33]. Finally, PP2A dephosphorylates several kinases controlling inflammatory or stress signaling pathways to dissipate inflammation [34, 35] and promote the viability of neuroprotective M2 microglia [36], or p47phox, whose dephosphorylation inactivates the whole NADPH oxidase complex to reduce oxidative stress [37]. Another stress kinase is MAP3K dual leucine zipper (DLK), overexpressed in AD brains [38], which is inhibited by PP2A in neurons [39]. Corroborating its relevance in protection against neurodegeneration, PP2A appears depressed, inhibited or inactivated in AD patients’ brains [40] and inhibition of its function in animal models results in neurodegenerative phenotypes [40]. For all of these reasons, pharmacological activation or re-activation of PP2A has become a valuable strategy for drug development in AD [41]. In the last decade, various approaches have been undertaken to reach these goals [17]. The majority of examples have been addressed to indirectly (re)activate PP2A, by inhibiting its cellular inhibitors, including I2/SET [42], CIP2A [43] and PME-1 [44] (Fig. 1). More recent contributions have focused on directly potentiating PP2A activity [45], highlighting phenothiazine derivatives and tricyclic sulfonamides, discovered from chemical library screenings [46], as small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs) [47] (Fig. 1). In addition, complex natural products have also been suggested to activate PP2A, such as polyphyllin I [43] (Fig. 1), cornel iridoid glycosides [48], Gingko Biloba extract [49] or pseudoginsenoside-F11 [50]. Overall, the direct PP2A-activating drug (PAD) that has reached the highest level of clinical trial up to date has been sodium selenate, known as VEL-015 [51]. For more than a decade, our research group has been interested in developing new direct PADs through rational drug design-based methodologies, backed up by computational docking [52]. Like that, we reported a 1,8-naphthyridine derivative (Fig. 2) [53] and a family of 3-aminomethylindoles [54] and azaindoles [55], showing both PP2A recovery capabilities and interesting neuroprotective profiles in several in vitro and in vivo models of AD. To obtain more potent and selective PADs, we recently focused on the chemical structure of okadaic acid (OA), the best-known PP2A selective inhibitor [56] (Fig. 2). This toxin has been the object of deep structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies [57], showing that the central cyclic fragment (C19 – C27) and the one at the spiroketal edge (C30 – C38) (Fig. 2) do not participate in the inhibitory effect of OA, as they interact with amino acids far from the PP2A-C catalytic triad. Instead, they increase the affinity of OA for the PP2A-C subunit [58, 59]. Hence, we hypothesized that small molecules mimicking these two cyclic fragments might still bind, but no longer inhibit PP2A-C. In addition, this particular interaction might also prevent PP2A inhibitors, either endogenous ones or toxins, could get close to PP2A; or that toxin- or cellular inhibitor-inhibited PP2A enzymatic activity could be restored. This hypothesis was recently underscored by the chemotherapeutic potential of a C-glycoside small analogue to OA C19–C27 fragment, named ITH12680 (1) (Fig. 2), which resensitized non-small cells lung cancer cells to cisplatin treatment in a model of chemoresistance, via a mechanism that restored PP2A activity [60]. In the current study, we report improved C-glycoside analogues of the OA C19–C27 fragment, and their neuroprotective potential in neurodegeneration models related to pathologic tau hyperphosphorylation.","The design of C-glycosides with potential PAD ability was based on the OA central fragment C19–C27, maintaining the absolute configuration of analogous stereocenters (Fig. 2). In some examples, we pursued increasing structural rigidity by tightening the exocyclic oxygen atoms through cyclic acetals. The drugability of designed compounds was maintained according to physicochemical properties related to Lipinski’s rule of five (Table S1, supplementary material). To furnish the desired entities, we have taken advantage of the Organic Chemistry literature centered on pursuing the total synthesis of OA [61–63] and other dinophysistoxins [64], where the contributions of Forsyth’s group have been crucial. Compound 1, prepared following the Hosomi-Sakurai reaction [60], was subjected to basic hydrolysis with sodium methoxide to afford diol 2 in quantitative yield (Scheme 1). Classical methods recruiting milder hydrolyses such as the use of TEA [61] were less efficient. As discussed above, rigidity was achieved by the generation of cyclic acetals, which also dissipated the high hydrophilicity of 2 (c log P = 0.3). First, the reaction of 2 with benzaldehyde dimethylacetal according to Isobe’s conditions yielded compound 3 in medium yields (Scheme 1). Despite the fact that acetal 3 showed sensibility to aqueous acid media, the use of neutralized solvents sorted out its potential instability. The acetal 4, which presents an acetonide structure, was obtained from reaction of 2 with 2-methoxypropene under mild acid catalysis in quantitative yield (Scheme 1), which exhibited increased stability. Then, with the purpose of resembling the oxygen at C19 of OA (Fig. 2), compounds 3 and 4 were hydroxylated under hydroboration/oxidation conditions. Unlike what was reported in the literature, treatment with diborane was unsuccessful in any of the experimental conditions tested. Better outcomes were achieved with 9-BBN, as its reaction with the benzylidene derivative 3 provided alcohol 5 (Scheme 2), although chromatographic purification was rather complicated. Only the use of a preparative TLC allowed to isolate alcohol 5 in low yields. The more stable acetonide 4 yielded alcohol 6 in good yields (82%, Scheme 2) after regular automatized chromatography. Noteworthy, beyond the left side of the OA C19–C27 fragment, the own C19 shows a diol substructure. Hence, we wondered whether a non-classical isosteres strategy to build a 1,2-diol moiety could furnish bioactive compounds. For that purpose, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation [65] allowed us to obtain derivatives possessing vicinal diols with high stereoselectivity from alkenes 3 and 4. The reaction of alkenes 3 (R1 = Ph, R2 = H) and 4 (R1, R2 = Me) with AD-mix-β resulted in the formation of 1,2-diols 7 and 8, respectively, possessing R configuration at C2 with high stereoselectivity and very good yields. Under similar experimental conditions, the commercial reagent AD-mix-α afforded the (2S)-alkenes 9 and 10 with good yields and very good stereoselectivity. AD-mix reagents α and β oppositely exert syn-dihydroxylations asymmetrically ruled by the cis-trans isomerism of the olefinic substrate. However, the stereoselective discrimination between both pro-chiral faces is not so obvious in monosubstituted alkenes such as 3 and 4. For this reason, we have confirmed the stereoselectivity of AD-mix reagents by X-Ray diffraction (Fig. S1, supplementary material) using compound 10 as a model. During the pharmacological evaluation of target compounds and subsequent computational docking studies, we considered of interest the benzoylation of mono-alcohols 5 and 6. Treatment with BzCl in pyridine generated benzoates 11 and 12 with very low yields (Scheme 3). Trends with stronger bases were unsuccessful. For instance, the use of K2CO3 as a base led to the diacetal 6 deprotection along benzoylation, yielding compound 13 (Table 1). Analogues to OA central fragment 1–13 mitigated OA and cytostatin-induced protein phosphatases inhibition in SH-SY5Y cells. The SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line is a well-described model to estimate the effect of potential PADs, as it draws a readable phosphatase activity that is sensitive to the presence of PP2A selective inhibitors: exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to the selective inhibitor OA at 15 nM for 18 h indeed diminished the para-nitrophenyl phosphate (p NPP)-measured phosphatase activity by 29% (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, most of the C-glycosides tested, administered at a concentration of 1 μM to SH-SY5Y cells, counteracted the OA-induced drop of phosphatase activity by 50% or more (Fig. 3 and Table S1, supplementary material). In general, rigidified compounds with benzylidene moiety outperformed their acetonide analogues, except for compound 10, which was the best PAD, together with benzylidene derivative 7. Only diol 13, which bears a long benzoyl group, was unable to antagonize OA inhibitory actions. Similarly, the incorporation of a benzoyl in 11 and 12 was unfruitful for PP2A recovery activity, compared with the corresponding free alcohol analogues 5 and 6. The AD drug memantine was used as standard in these experiments, considering its pro-activating profile of PP2A [66] independent of the blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate-sensitive glutamate receptors (NMDAr). Although the cellular manifestations caused by nanomolar concentrations of OA are generally ascribed to its inhibitory effect on PP2A [67], a possibility exists that it could affect other PPP with a less physiological role in the central nervous system, such as PP1, PP4 or PP5 [56, 68]. To corroborate that activity of compounds 1–13 was directly related to a PP2A restoring profile, we repeated p NPP-based experiments using the toxin cytostatin, which is a less potent but much more selective PP2A inhibitor [68]. SH-SY5Y cells treated with cytostatin at 2 μM diminished their p-NPP-probed phosphatase activity by 28% (Fig. 4). In a quite similar fashion to that observed in the previous experiment with OA, most of the assayed C-glycosides dissipated the inhibitory effects of cytostatin on SH-SY5Y cells by around 50%. The best antagonist compound against cytostatin was diol 2. Again, the incorporation of benzoyl was detrimental for PAD activity. In some cases, acetonides worsened recovery of phosphatase activity compared with benzylidene analogues, but this was not so obvious in diols 7–10. Indeed, these C-glycosides presenting a 1,2-diol group from Sharpless’ dihydroxylation presented a very robust PAD capacity (Figs. 3 and 4). Analogues to OA central fragment 1–13 protected in vitro neuronal models against several toxic stimuli related to neurodegeneration. Prior to assessing the neuroprotective effects of the compounds 1–13 at in vitro models of neurodegeneration, we confirmed that C-glycosides per se lacked toxicity in a wide range of concentrations, measured with the method of MTT reduction (Fig. S2, supplementary material). A tiny reduction of cell viability is only observed upon the use of compound 2 at a concentration of 30 μM (Fig. S2, supplementary material). Next, we evaluated whether the PAD activity of compounds 1–13 exerted neuroprotection in neuronal in vitro models damaged with several toxic stimuli related to neurodegeneration. Because of its high inhibitory capacity of PPP, mainly of PP2A, OA has been widely used to resemble AD manifestations in particular, but tauopathies in general, in both in vitro and in vivo models [54–56, 67]. For instance, it has been described that SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cultures show a loss of cell viability when challenged with OA at nanomolar concentrations during several hours of incubation [69]. A 20 h-exposition of SH-SY5Y cells to OA 20 nM indeed provoked a loss of about 30% in cell viability, measured by the MTT colorimetric dye, of about 30%. In this situation, compounds 1–13, pre-incubated (24 h) and co-incubated at 1 μM with OA 20 nM, protected SH-SY5Y cells from OA-induced cell death in a statistically significant fashion, except 7, 8 and 13 (Table 1). Stereochemistry at C2 dramatically influenced neuroprotection vs OA. The reference drug memantine was used as standard in the PP2A inhibition-derived neuroprotection experiments [66]. On the other hand, cytostatin has not been object of extensive research as an inducer model of neuronal death. Nevertheless, we found that it was a very reliable and straightforward tool to support and reinforce that the neuroprotective properties of the target compounds 1–13 are directly related to PP2A restoring activity. Thus, cytostatin, added to SH-SY5Y cells at 2.5 μM for 20 h, provoked a 35% drop of cell viability, monitored by the MTT assay. Again, most C-glycosides tested mitigated the neuronal damage induced by cytostatin (Table 1), as only compounds 7 and 13 failed, while the 1,2-diol acetonide derivative 10 provided the best neuroprotection. One of the most relevant features of PP2A is the control of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, as it down-regulates several neurodegeneration-leading inflammatory mediators, by dephosphorylation [34, 37]. For this reason, we found of interest to test the neuroprotective profile of compounds 1–13 in an in vitro model of oxidative stress, induced by 30 μM rotenone/10 μM oligomycin A (R/O). Rotenone and oligomycin A inhibit complexes I and V of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, respectively, triggering reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ATP synthesis lockout [70]. Application of the R/O cocktail to SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h resulted in a cell viability decay of 40%. The pre- and co-incubation with the C-glycosides at 1 μM protected the neuroblastoma cultures against cell damage by R/O in 8 out of the 13 compounds probed, with the largest effect seen for alkene 4 (Table 1). Although they have not been designed as antioxidants, the fact that this family of PADs exhibited a neuroprotective profile against oxidative stress underlines the important role of PP2A in the regulation of the cellular redox state. In this respect, the incorporation of a benzoyl moiety in compounds 11–13 impaired the antioxidant properties of this series, while the presence of a pending vinyl group promoted this, presumably because of the scavenging character of accessible double bonds. The last cell model we used to test our compounds was based on the excitotoxicity suffered by neuronal cultures exposed to high and sustained concentrations of glutamate, i.e. 50 μM, which can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative disorders [66], leading to overstimulation of NMDAr and neuronal cell death [71]. The value of this experimental model lies in the fact that PP2A regulates NMDAr signaling [72], for instance, by dephosphorylation of its NR1 subunit, thereby desensitizing it. So, a potential PP2A activator should hinder the neurotoxic events derived from glutamate exposure. Since SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells lack functional NMDAr [73], we used embryonic rat cortical neurons to evaluate potential neuroprotective effects exerted by C-glycosides 1–13 against glutamate excitotoxicity. First, the compounds were incubated with cortical neurons in the absence of glutamate to monitor any per se toxicity in this model (Fig. S3, supplementary material). Only 11 and 8, with no-significance in this case, slightly diminished neuronal viability at 30 μM. Next, we repeated these experiments in the presence of glutamate. While glutamate decreased cell viability by 48%, two thirds of the compounds protected cortical neurons against this toxic stimulus in a statistically significant fashion (Table 1). Again, the family of 1,2-diols 7–10 showed the best protective effect, as they increased glutamate-challenged cortical neuron viability by about 20%, similarly to the NMDAr antagonist memantine. In conclusion, most of the C-glycosides analogues to the OA central fragment studied herein, showed a wide-spectrum neuroprotective profile and a good ability to restore or increase PP2A enzymatic activity. Among all derivatives examined, the C-glycosides 1, 3, 9 and 10 outstood, for (1) developing neuroprotection in all the models tested, for (2) preventing the OA or cytostatin-induced PP2A inhibition, and for (3) lacking toxicity per se in a wide range of concentrations. Of these four compounds, compound 10 was further selected for additional follow-up studies that aimed to deepen its pharmacological and safety profile and its mechanism of action, since it resulted in the highest restoration of OA-inhibited PP2A activity (Fig. 3), and the best protective effect against cytostatin-induced neurotoxicity (Table 1). Rigid analog to OA central fragment 10 reduced the OA-induced inhibition of PP2A-B55α and PP2A-B56α isolated from transfected HEK-293T cells. We further confirmed the PP2A-recovering capability of compound 10 by carrying out in vitro phosphatase activity measurements on purified PP2A complexes using a canonical phospho-peptide substrate (K-R-pT-I-R-R) through the Malachite Green method (Fig. 5). Two different PP2A trimeric complexes were analyzed, one harboring the B55α (or Bα) isoform, which is the chief regulatory enzyme of tau dephosphorylation [74], and one encompassing the B56α (or B’α) subunit, which down-regulates major tau kinases, such as ERK1/2 [75]. Both PP2A trimers were isolated by GFP-trapping from HEK-293T cells transfected with GFP-tagged B-type subunits, as described [60]. Since these trimers manifested a slightly different sensitivity to OA, the transfected cells were subjected to a slightly different concentration of the toxin, which resulted in both cases in a detectable and significant reduction of phosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 5, PP2A-B55α and PP2A-B56α showed a time-dependent inhibition of about 20–30% when isolated from cells challenged with 15 and 20 nM OA, respectively. Noticeably, the rigid C-glycoside 10, administered at 1 μM, partially recovered OA-inhibited PP2A enzymatic activities (Fig. 5), with a higher efficiency towards PP2A-B55α than over PP2A-B56α. Compound 10 prevented the OA-induced increase of tau and GSK-3β phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. We next wondered whether the rigid glycoside 10 would also be able to modulate the phosphorylation levels of two phosphoprotein substrates of PP2A in SH-SY5Y cells: tau and GSK-3β. Western-blot experiments corroborated increased tau phosphorylation at amino acids Ser202 and Thr205 upon 20 h of OA treatment (Fig. 6A). Increased phosphorylation at these sites is commonly found in NFT [28]. The presence of the C-glycoside 10 prevented OA-induced tau hyperphosphorylation by half (Fig. 6A). Since it is well-known that PP2A dephosphorylates these pro-aggregating amino acids in tau [76], we might speculate that the administration of PADs like C-glycoside 10, by up-regulating PP2A, might prevent NFT formation, thereby counteracting tauopathy progression. In addition, PP2A regulates the enzymatic activity of several tau kinases. We found that C-glycoside 10 may also intervene with this regulation mechanism, since it also inhibited OA-induced GSK-3β hyperphosphorylation at Ser9 (Fig. 6B). Computational docking of 10 on PP2A catalytic subunit. Backed by the promising PAD profile of 10, and with the aim of figuring the structural clues of its interaction to PP2A, we ran docking studies on the catalytic subunit PP2A-C. PP2A crystal structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org, 2IE4) [57]. Under its lowest energy conformation, compound 10 is posed at a binding pocket formed by amino acids Gln122, Ile123, Val189, Pro190 and His191 (Fig. 7A). The OA fragments C19–C27 and C30–C38 also present high affinity for these amino acids [57]. Electrostatic view (Fig. 7B) shows that alcohols at C1 and C2 of 10 are accommodated at a positive-charged area, whilst methyl groups are projected to a neutral area formed by Ile123, Gln122 and Val126. Fig. 7C illustrates possible interactions of 10 with this binding pocket. Methyl groups face to a neutral area, generating hydrophobic interactions with Ile123 and the hydrocarbon skeleton of Gln122. Several H-bonds (Fig. 7C, dashed green lines) can be detected, where the strongest is that between C1(S)–OH as a donor and the carbonyl of Pro190 (1.91 Å). This OH also H-bonds as a donor with the Cys196 sulfur (2.86 Å) and, as an acceptor, with the Trp200 indole NH (2.80 Å). These interactions could explain the good results of the dihydroxylated derivatives 7–10, but also the slightly better behavior of 10 compared with 8. In addition, the electronically dense glycosidic oxygen H-bonds the positively charged His191 (3.12 Å). A weak but intramolecular (therefore favored) H-bond appears between C1–OH and one of the dioxin oxygen atoms (3.81 Å). This intramolecular interaction could be the driving force for the shape of the hydrocarbon chain of 10, placed behind the C-glycoside cycle, influencing pharmacological properties. To probe this hypothesis, compounds 11–13 were synthesized. Since they proved to be the worst PAD of the family, such hypothesis would prevail. Compound 10 shows a high probability of CNS penetration. Based on its pharmacological properties, compound 10 seems an appropriate drug for further in vivo studies and preclinical assays. However, even the most suitable pharmacodynamic properties of a drug are worthless unless it can reach its site of action. Since the entire family of designed compounds, including 10, fulfill the Lipinski’s rule of five, we expect them to show an appropriate bioavailability. However, as these compounds need to be able to exert their pharmacological activity within the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, to cross the highly lipophilic blood-brain barrier (BBB), we carried out parallel artificial membrane permeation assays (PAMPA) [77] in the presence of a lipid extract of porcine brains (Fig. 8). The results show that compound 10 proves a high probability of brain penetration, similar to that offered by the positive control testosterone (T) (Fig. 8). In silico testing of compound 10 safety profile. As compound 10 demonstrated the best pharmacological profile, we decide to assess its toxicity profile and metabolism in silico with Toxtree software v. 3.1.0 [78]. Compound 10 showed an acceptable safety profile (Table S2, supplementary material), no structural alerts were found for in vitro mutagenicity, genotoxic or non-genotoxic carcinogenicity, and no DNA binding alerts were detected. Further in vivo testing is needed to assess the heterocyclic rings and the hydrogen bond-accepting structure safety, which cannot permit a strong initial presumption of safety. We additionally used the Toxtree Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism module to predict the more plausible metabolites of compound 10 (Table S3, supplementary material). The four predicted metabolites displayed similar safety results to the parent compound (Table S4-to S6, supplementary material). Therefore, the obtained results made the molecule suitable to continue with the in vivo tests. Compound 10 rescued the memory deficit of mice subjected to LPS in the object recognition test. Backed by the BBB permeability data, we next performed the first in vivo studies with the lead compound 10. To this end, we assessed whether this compound could abrogate the cognitive impairment in a classical in vivo model of neurodegeneration, i.e. the object recognition test in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Fig. 9). In this test, the short-term memory of mice is measured, by comparing the exploration time between an object previously shown in a training phase (see experimental part), and another one introduced in the test phase. Mice with normal short-term memory are expected to explore the novel object for a longer time compared with animals subjected to a neurotoxicant such as LPS that induced neurodegeneration and memory loss [79]. The neurodegenerative effects of LPS have been comprehensively reviewed [80], and include the development of tauopathy and reduced short-term memory [81]. As expected, i.p. injection of LPS 1 mg/mL provoked mice to lose interest for the novel object, as no significant difference was observed between the exploration time of the old versus the new object in the test phase (Fig. 9), inferring that their memory was compromised. However, co-injection of compound 10 at a 10 mg/mL i.p. dose, impeded such loss of memory, as LPS-subjected mice treated with compound 10 now invested significantly more time (2.4-fold) exploring the new object versus the old one (Fig. 9)."

Death-associated protein kinase 1 
as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease
Tao Zhang1, Byeong Mo Kim2* and Tae Ho Lee1*   
Abstract 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly and represents a major clinical chal-
lenge in the ageing society. Neuropathological hallmarks of AD include neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyper-
phosphorylated tau, senile plaques derived from the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, brain atrophy induced 
by neuronal loss, and synaptic dysfunctions. Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is ubiquitously expressed 
in the central nervous system. Dysregulation of DAPK1 has been shown to contribute to various neurological diseases 
including AD, ischemic stroke and Parkinson’s disease (PD). We have established an upstream effect of DAPK1 on Aβ 
and tau pathologies and neuronal apoptosis through kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation, supporting a causal 
role of DAPK1 in the pathophysiology of AD. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about how DAPK1 
is involved in various AD pathological changes including tau hyperphosphorylation, Aβ deposition, neuronal cell 
death and synaptic degeneration. The underlying molecular mechanisms of DAPK1 dysregulation in AD are discussed. 
We also review the recent progress regarding the development of novel DAPK1 modulators and their potential 
applications in AD intervention. These findings substantiate DAPK1 as a novel therapeutic target for the development 
of multifunctional disease-modifying treatments for AD and other neurological disorders.

Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent chronic 
neurodegenerative disorder. According to the newest sta-
tistics, more than 55 million people worldwide are suffer-
ing from AD or related dementia, making AD and other 
dementias the leading cause of disabilities in the elderly 
[1]. As of 2019, the estimated healthcare cost among peo-
ple with dementia was more than $590 billion, and this 
cost is projected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2050 [2]. AD is 
characterized pathologically by the formation of numer -
ous intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed 
of highly phosphorylated tau proteins and extracellular 
senile plaques composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. In 
addition to NFTs and amyloid plaques, oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction are com -
monly observed during disease progression, and contrib -
ute to cell death, breakdown of the blood–brain barrier 
(BBB) and impairment of neural circuits in the brain. 
In particular, neuronal loss is a prominent pathological 
feature in AD, and has been associated with both struc -
tural and functional changes in brain regions involved in 
learning and memory [3].

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a 
pivotal role in regulating the microtubule dynamics. The 
interaction between tau and microtubules is affected by 
the phosphorylation status of tau in neurons, which is 
controlled by a host of kinases and phosphatases [4, 5]. 
The pathological phosphorylation of tau in AD not only 
drives the dissociation of tau from microtubules, but 
also affects the localization and solubility of tau in neu -
rons [6–8], thus leading to microtubule disruption and 
the formation of filamentous paired helical filaments in 
the AD brain [9–11]. The spatiotemporal accumulation 
of NFTs in the brain is significantly correlated with dis -
ease progression and the degree of cognitive impairment 
in AD patients [12–14], suggesting a central role of tau 
hyperphosphorylation in neurodegeneration.
The aggregation of Aβ, a product from amyloid precur -
sor protein (APP) proteolysis, forms soluble oligomers 
and insoluble fibrils in the brain. The accumulation of Aβ 
species in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain paren -
chyma is an early pathological feature of AD and has long 
been considered as an upstream trigger of various path -
ological changes in disease progression [15]. There are 
two distinct proteolytic pathways of APP , the non-amy -
loidogenic processing which involves sequential cleavage 
of APP by α- and γ-secretases, and the amyloidogenic 
processing which is mediated by β- and γ-secretases 
[16–20]. The main products of the amyloidogenic path -
way are Aβ40 and Aβ42 [21–23]. The generation of Aβ 
is regulated by both the function of secretases and the 
expression of APP [24, 25]. For example, pathogenic 
mutations in APP and presenilin-1 (PS1) in familial AD 
strongly promote Aβ production and increase the Aβ42/
Aβ40 ratio [26–30]. Besides, post-translational modifica -
tions of APP such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and 
sumoylation also have a direct impact on Aβ generation 
[31–33].
DAPK1, a serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase, 
was initially identified from an antisense cDNA expres -
sion library of HeLa cells as a potential mediator of 
interferon-γ-induced cell death [34]. In subsequent stud -
ies, DAPK1 was shown to play a critical role in stimu -
lus-triggered apoptosis, autophagy, and anoikis-like cell 
death. The pro-apoptotic function of DAPK1 is closely 
associated with the pathogenesis of cancer and neurode -
generative diseases [35]. In particular, genetic variations 
in DAPK1 have been shown to be associated with late-
onset AD (LOAD) in different populations [36–38]. Fur -
thermore, the high abundance of DAPK1 in the cortex 
and hippocampus also highlights a central role of DAPK1 
in regulating neuronal functions [39].
In this review, we discuss the role of DAPK1 and its 
implications in the pathophysiology of brain diseases, 
with a particular focus on AD. We also discuss strategies 
and translational potential for attenuating AD-related 
neuropathologies through pharmacological or genetic 
targeting of DAPK1.
Structural and functional properties of DAPK1
The DAPK family
The human DAPK family consists of five kinase mem -
bers: DAPK1, DAPK1-related protein 1 (DRP-1 or 
DAPK2), zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK or 
DAPK3), DAPK1-related apoptosis-inducing protein 
kinase 1 (DRAK1), and DRAK2 (Fig.  1a). Among these 
family members, DAPK2 and DAPK3 are highly homol -
ogous to DAPK1 in the catalytic domains, showing 80% 
and 83% identity at the amino acid level, respectively 
[40]. However, the kinase domains of human DRAK1 
and DRAK2 share only 48% and 51% sequence homology 
with the catalytic domain of DAPK1 [41]. The extra-cat -
alytic domains of DAPK family members vary greatly in 
size and structure, indicating distinct regulatory mecha -
nisms, subcellular localizations and biological func -
tions of these kinases. For instance, DAPK1 and DAPK2 
are mainly found in the cytoplasm, and DAPK3 can be 
detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [42], 
while both DRAK1 and DRAK2 are exclusively localized 
to the cell nucleus [43]. In addition to the subcellular dis -
tribution, the DAPK family members also show different 
tissue expression profiles in the human body. For exam -
ple, the expression of DAPK1 and DAPK3 has low tissue 
specificity, while DAPK2 is abundantly expressed in the 
bone marrow [44].
DAPK1 structure
DAPK1 is a multidomain protein with distinct functional 
motifs involved in the modulation of catalytic activity, 
substrate binding, protein stability and localization of 
DAPK1. As shown in Fig.  1a, DAPK1 is composed of a 
kinase domain (13–267 aa), a  Ca2+/calmodulin  (Ca2+/
CaM)-binding domain (275–334 aa), an ankyrin repeats 
domain (378–638 aa), two putative P-loops, a Ras of 
complex (ROC) domain (667–995 aa), a C-terminal of 
ROC (COR) domain (995–1288 aa), a death domain (DD, 
1300–1398 aa) and a C-terminal serine-rich tail [35]. To 
date, there is no 3D structure of full-length DAPK1 avail -
able in the protein data bank, while the structure of the 
kinase domain of DAPK1 is well-resolved.
The catalytic domain of DAPK1 is composed of 11 sub -
domains, including a β-sheet-rich N-lobe and an α-helix-
rich C-lobe connected by a short hinge region (Fig.  1b). 
The conserved lysine (K42) in this domain is vital for 
the kinase activity as it is inside the ATP-binding loop. 
The catalytic activity of DAPK1 is abolished by substi -
tuting the lysine residue with an alanine residue (K42A) 
[45]. The basic loop region (45–56 aa) containing mostly  Page 3 of 26
Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
 
positively charged residues in the kinase domain is a 
characteristic motif of the DAPK family as it is respon -
sible for the homo- and hetero-dimerization of DAPK, 
which is critical for the modulation of kinase activity 
[46]. In addition to a direct regulation of catalytic activ -
ity, the kinase domain also affects the protein stability 
of DAPK1 by interacting with the chaperone heat shock 
protein 90 (HSP90) through the amino terminal lobe 
(αC-β4 loop) [47, 48]. It has been suggested that the 
enriched neutral and positively charged residues in this 
subdomain are responsible for the interaction between 
DAPK1 and HSP90 [48], which further contributes to 
the maturation and stabilization of cellular DAPK1. The 
catalytic activity of DAPK1 is also regulated by the  Ca2+/
CaM–autoregulatory domain, which serves as a pseudo-
substrate and occupies the catalytic cleft in the absence 
of CaM, thereby preventing the activation of DAPK1. In 
addition, the enzymatic activity of DAPK1 is regulated 
through phosphorylation at several sites that are located 
within the  Ca2+/CaM-autoregulatory domain. For exam -
ple, the autophosphorylation of Ser308 of DAPK1 has an 
inhibitory effect on its kinase activity [49]. Full activation 
of DAPK1 requires both dephosphorylation of Ser308 
and binding of the  Ca2+-activated CaM to the autoregu -
latory domain [50]. The interaction with CaM can release 
the catalytic cleft of DAPK1, and the dephosphorylation 
of Ser308 increases the affinity for CaM, thereby promot-
ing the catalytic activity of DAPK1 even at low CaM lev -
els [50].
The ankyrin repeats domain, made up of eight lin -
early aligned motifs with 33 amino acid residues, is a 
protein–protein interaction domain facilitating com -
munication with other proteins. This domain is involved 
in the interaction between DAPK1 and actin filaments, 
which is pivotal for the correct cellular localization of 
DAPK1 [51]. Additionally, several ubiquitin ligases such 
as DAPK-interacting protein 1 (DIP-1) and carboxyl ter -
minal of HSP70-interacting protein have been reported 
to interact with DAPK1 via the ankyrin repeats domain, 
thus regulating the proteasomal degradation of DAPK1 
in cells [52, 53]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that 
the phosphorylation of Tyr491/492 residues in the fourth 
ankyrin repeat by Src kinase inhibits the catalytic activity 
of DAPK1 [54].

The ROC and COR domains of DAPK1 regulate the 
kinase activity of DAPK1 by functioning as a GTPase. 
DAPK1 binds to GTP via the P-loop motif in the ROC 
domain and hydrolyzes GTP , resulting in conforma -
tional changes in the kinase and a reduction in inhibitory 
Ser308 phosphorylation [55, 56]. Apart from the intrinsic 
GTPase activity, the ROC-COR domain is able to inter -
act with the phospho-Ser/Thr-directed peptidyl prolyl 
isomerase 1 (Pin1) via the cytoskeleton-binding region, 
leading to suppression of the activity of Pin1 that is criti -
cal for regulating the function of various phosphopro -
teins by isomerizing the phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro motif [57, 
58].
The death domain of DAPK1 also actively regulates the 
kinase activity and the degradation of DAPK1, and par -
ticipates in protein–protein interactions important for 
cellular apoptosis and energy metabolism. For instance, 
the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) binds to 
the death domain and phosphorylates the Ser735 residue 
of DAPK1, which enhances the kinase activity of DAPK1 
in vitro and in vivo [59]. DAPK1 is able to interact with 
Kelch-like family member 20 and tuberous sclerosis 2 
protein via the death domain, resulting in the protea -
some- and lysosome-mediated degradation of DAPK1, 
respectively [60, 61]. Interestingly, DAPK1 has been 
reported to interact with and activate the pyruvate kinase 
isoform M2 in cancer cells in a kinase activity-independ -
ent manner. This interaction alters cellular metabolism 
by increasing the glycolytic rate and the generation of 
lactate in cells [62]. The serine-rich tail in the C-terminus 
acts as a negative regulator of DAPK1 activity as the dele-
tion of this domain augments the pro-apoptotic function 
of DAPK1 [63].
In addition to the K42A mutant which shows dimin -
ished kinase activity, several other DAPK1 mutants have 
also been developed for research purposes. The ΔCaM, 
a mutant lacking the  Ca2+/CaM-binding domain, and 
the phosphoablative S308A mutant, in which serine 308 
is replaced by an alanine residue, are examples of con -
stitutively active forms of DAPK1 with elevated catalytic 
activity [64]. The ΔCyto, a mutant lacking the cytoskel -
eton-binding region, shows altered colocalization with 
actin filaments and thus affects the cellular function of 
DAPK1 [64].
DAPK1 and AD
Protein kinases play an important role in the pathogen -
esis of neurodegenerative diseases [65, 66]. The activi -
ties of a variety of neuronal enzymes, receptors, and ion 
channels are regulated by their phosphorylation status 
[67, 68]. The spatiotemporal expression of DAPK1 in the 
brain indicates an essential role of this kinase in the regu-
lation of neuronal functions. Further genetic analyses and 
animal studies have established that DAPK1 is indeed 
involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegen -
erative diseases. Herein, we focus on the role of DAPK1 
in AD based on the research from our group and oth -
ers, in order to present a comprehensive picture of how 
DAPK1 contributes to the pathophysiology of AD as well 
as the therapeutics targeting DAPK1.
Expression of DAPK1 in the brain
Although DAPK1 is ubiquitously present in different tis -
sues and cell types, it is most abundantly expressed in 
the brain and lung tissues according to a Northern blot -
ting analysis in rats [39]. In particular, the spatiotemporal 
expression of DAPK1 in the brain appears to be associ -
ated with neurodevelopment and neurogenesis. The tem -
poral analysis of DAPK1 mRNA expression in rat brains 
revealed that the expression of DAPK1 mRNA is detect -
able at embryonic day 13 (E13) and further increases to a 
peak at approximately E20. However, the DAPK1 mRNA 
level gradually declines after birth [39]. The spatial deter -
mination of DAPK1 expression by in  situ hybridization 
shows that DAPK1 mRNA can be extensively found in 
both proliferative and postmitotic regions within the 
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum during 
embryonic development and the neonatal stage [39]. 
These regions undergo widespread programmed cell 
death in embryonic neurogenesis [69, 70]. At postnatal 
and adult stages, the cerebral cortex and cerebellum both 
manifest a significant decline in DAPK1 mRNA expres -
sion, while DAPK1 expression in the hippocampus is 
maintained at high levels particularly in CA1, CA2 and 
the dentate gyrus [39, 71]. Besides, neuronal cells have 
higher DAPK1 expression than glial cells in the brain 
under physiological conditions. Thus, the widespread 
expression of DAPK1 during brain development and 
confined expression in mature neuronal populations in 
adults suggest that DAPK1 may not only participate in 
developmental neuronal death, but also play a role in reg-
ulating neuronal activity and synaptic functions. Indeed, 
it has been reported that DAPK1 is substantially enriched 
in hippocampal synapses and has complex interactions 
with numerous synaptic proteins [72, 73], which under -
lies the pathological influence of DAPK1 dysregulation 
on brain functions in neurological disorders such as AD.
Dysregulation of DAPK1 expression or function 
in neurological diseases
As a stress-responsive protein kinase, the dysregulation of 
DAPK1 expression or its activity has been implicated in 
a variety of neurological disorders. In Table  1, we briefly 
summarize how DAPK1 is dysregulated in common 
neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke, PD, AD, 
epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). For instance,  Page 5 of 26

cerebral ischemia not only leads to DAPK1 activation, but 
also induces aberrant interactions between DAPK1 and 
other proteins such as p53 and GluN2B, thereby leading 
to neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction [73, 74]. The 
activation of DAPK1 in ischemia is likely mediated by 
the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-induced 
 Ca2+ influx and the subsequent dephosphorylation at 
Ser308 of DAPK1 by the calcineurin phosphatase [75]. 
Another common disease with  Ca2+ signaling disorder 
is epilepsy. Interestingly, our research demonstrated that 
DAPK1 dysregulation in epilepsy is model-dependent, 
as convulsive dosing of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) imme -
diately activates the DAPK1 function in the mouse brain 
without upregulating its expression, while chronic expo -
sure to PTZ at a low dose in the kindling model increased 
both the protein level and the activity of DAPK1 in the 
mouse brain [76]. Further, our study showed that kainic 
acid (KA) promotes DAPK1 activity by upregulating the 
ERK-mediated Ser735 phosphorylation in a mouse epi -
lepsy model [77].
The dysregulation of DAPK1 is also noted in neurode -
generative proteinopathies such as AD, PD and TBI. For 
example, our previous research reported that the DAPK1 
protein level but not its mRNA expression is significantly 
upregulated in the hippocampus of AD patients [78, 79]. 
Likewise, it has been shown that the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-
1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse 
model displays a marked increase in DAPK1 protein 
level in the striatal neurons without showing alterations 
of mRNA expression. The specific DAPK1 alteration pat -
tern in AD and PD might be caused by the post-tran -
scriptional regulatory mechanisms such as microRNA 
(miRNA)-mediated translational control of the target 
protein. Several miRNAs targeting DAPK1 have been 
found to be dysregulated in AD or PD [80–82]. These 
findings highlight a detrimental role of DAPK1 dysregu -
lation in the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenera -
tive diseases. The relationship between DAPK1 and AD 
will be elaborated in the following sections to clarify the 
genetic associations, functional changes and underlying 
mechanisms.
Genetic association of DAPK1 with AD
Genetic variation is thought to play a major role in the 
etiology of LOAD, which accounts for about 95% of all 
AD cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
have been used to identify single-nucleotide polymor -
phisms (SNPs) in genes associated with the risk and the 
age of onset of AD. A number of genetic loci contributing 
to the susceptibility to AD have been identified [83–87]. 
Among them, the ε4 allele of ApoE has been confirmed as 
the strongest genetic risk factor for AD in various popu -
lations [88, 89]. The risk of AD is increased by about 3 
folds and 15 folds in individuals carrying one or two cop -
ies of ApoE4 gene, respectively. The presence of ApoE4 
allele is also associated with a younger age of onset of AD 
symptoms [90].
Several genetic variants (e.g., the unc-13 homolog B 
gene) in chromosome 9 have been suggested to be con -
nected with the risk of LOAD in whole-genome sequenc-
ing and parametric linkage analyses [91]. SNP analysis of 
DAPK1, which is also localized on chromosome 9, has 
identified two variants, rs4878104 and rs4877365, that 
are potentially connected with LOAD in several sam -
ple cohorts [36]. This discovery has sparked research on 
DAPK1 SNPs and AD susceptibility in different popula -
tions, yielding controversial results regarding whether 
DAPK1 SNPs are correlated with the risk of LOAD. 
Li et  al. first reported that rs4878104 and rs4877365 
of DAPK1 influence the transcription of DAPK1  in an 
allele-specific manner, although both SNPs are inside the 
DAPK1 introns [36]. In particular, rs4878104 is located 
within a previously identified LOAD linkage peak and 
is repeatedly validated for its association with LOAD in 
six independent sample sets [36]. This finding was fur -
ther corroborated by a genetic study in the Northern Han 
Chinese population, which showed that the genotype and 
the frequency of the rs4878104 but not the rs4877365 
variant are significantly different between LOAD patients 
and age-matched controls [38]. Conversely, Minster 
et al. revealed that none of the DAPK1  SNPs are associ -
ated with LOAD in their cohort [92]. Similar results were 
also reported by several GWAS analyses in French, Pol -
ish and Italian populations [37, 93, 94]. The inconsistent 
findings then led to systematic meta-analysis aiming at 
elucidating the association between DAPK1  variants and 
AD, which discovered that the rs4878104 variant is not 
significantly associated with AD risk in the pooled popu -
lation. Nevertheless, the subgroup analysis demonstrated 
that the rs4878104 variant is linked with AD risk in both 
American and Chinese populations but not in the Euro -
pean population [95]. Genotyping of rs4878104 revealed 
a discrepancy in the association between allele frequency 
and AD risk between Chinese and Caucasian popula -
tions, showing that the minor T allele is protective in 
Caucasians while the minor C allele is beneficial in Chi -
nese population [36, 38].
In addition to the GWAS analysis, several biomarker-
based studies have been performed to explore the associ -
ation between DAPK1 and AD pathologies. For instance, 
Kauwe et al. reported that the minor allele of rs4878104 
is associated with increased total CSF Aβ level [96]. 
However, by comparing brain samples from AD patients 
and healthy controls, Hainsworth et al. revealed that the 
expression of DAPK1 in the frontal cortex is not signifi -
cantly different between AD and control cases. Moreover,  Page 8 of 26Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
the abundance of DAPK1 in the brain is also not corre -
lated with Aβ level [97]. Thus far, there is still a lack of 
consistent molecular evidence to affirm the genetic asso -
ciation between DAPK1  polymorphisms and the sus -
ceptibility to AD, likely due to the complex etiology of 
AD attributed to gene-environmental interactions [98]. 
Therefore, it is necessary to carry out large-scale genetic 
analysis under the latest Alzheimer’s diagnostic frame -
work by applying genetic epidemiologic methods such 
as Mendelian randomization, to better clarify the exact 
association between DAPK1 and AD phenotypes.
DAPK1 dysregulation in AD patients and mouse models
The genetic link between DAPK1  variants and AD has 
triggered further investigations on whether DAPK1 is 
dysregulated in the brains of AD patients or mouse mod -
els. In the adult brain, DAPK1 expression is relatively 
abundant in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex [39, 
71], two brain regions that are significantly affected dur -
ing AD progression. Hainsworth et  al. first compared 
the protein level of DAPK1 in the frontal cerebral cor -
tex between AD patients and age-matched controls. The 
overall abundance of DAPK1 evaluated by immunoblot 
and immunostaining analyses was not significantly dif -
ferent between AD and control samples, although the 
AD cases displayed a trend of increase in the immuno -
blot analysis [97]. To further determine whether hip -
pocampal DAPK1 expression differs between AD and 
control brains, we analyzed hippocampal tissues from 
AD patients and age-matched controls, and discovered 
that the DAPK1 protein level was markedly increased by 
about 2.5 folds in the hippocampus of AD patients com -
pared with that in normal subjects [78, 79]. However, 
there was no significant difference in DAPK1 mRNA 
expression between AD and control samples [79]. Nota -
bly, the upregulation of DAPK1 appears to correlate with 
tau hyperphosphorylation in our sample cohorts [79]. 
Since tau pathology occurs early in the entorhinal cortex 
and hippocampus during AD progression and may lead 
to irreversible synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss 
[115], we hypothesize that the hippocampal DAPK1 dys -
regulation may also be an early pathological event in the 
disease course of AD. In line with this, a recent study dis -
covered that the AD patients have significantly elevated 
plasma DAPK1 content compared with age-matched 
controls. In addition, this increase is negatively correlated 
with the cognitive ability [111]. Thus, the DAPK1 protein 
can be potentially developed as a clinical biomarker to

In AD mouse models, whether DAPK1 expression or 
function is dysregulated remains controversial in litera -
ture. Hainsworth et al. determined DAPK1 expression in 
brains of aged Tg2576 transgenic mice overexpressing the 
APP Swedish mutant and found that the DAPK1 protein 
level was comparable between AD mice and wild-type 
(WT) controls [97]. However, the expression of DAPK1 
was significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of PS1 
V97L transgenic mice compared with control mice at 6 
and 9 months of age, which correlated with the appear -
ance of Aβ accumulation and cognitive impairment [111]. 
Similarly, Duan et  al. reported an elevation of DAPK1 
expression in the hippocampus and cortex of 10-month-
old human tau transgenic (hTau) mouse model, which 
paralleled the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau at 
Ser262 [113]. Nevertheless, none of the studies evaluated 
whether the enzymatic activity of DAPK1 is dysregulated 
in the brains of AD mouse models. Besides, whether 
DAPK1 is dysregulated in other AD mouse models of Aβ 
(e.g., APP/PS1 or 5×FAD) or tau (e.g., PS19 or tau P301L) 
pathologies remains to be characterized. Interestingly, it 
has been demonstrated that the expression of DAPK1 is 
elevated in the cortex overlying the corpus callosum in 
a mouse model of vascular dementia, which then drives 
abnormal accumulation of misfolded tau proteins in neu-
rons and endothelial cells [116]. Brain ageing is tightly 
associated with the accumulation of cellular senescence 
in response to various stress signals, which may lead to 
structural and functional impairments in the central 
nervous system [117]. Guo et al. reported that the activity 
of DAPK1 is gradually increased whilst the protein level 
remains constant during the aging process in mouse hip -
pocampus [118]. The age-dependent DAPK1 activation 
contributes to cognitive dysfunction in aged mice [118]. 
These findings indeed suggest that DAPK1 dysregulation 
plays a role in various cognitive disorders. Nevertheless, 
systematic analysis of DAPK1 expression and activity in 
the brains of AD mouse models is required to fully dis -
sect the spatiotemporal association between DAPK1 and 
AD neuropathologies.
Molecular mechanisms underlying DAPK1 dysregulation 
in AD
The protein level of DAPK1 is tightly controlled by both 
transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. 
Some transcriptional factors such as p53 and the cAMP 
response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) have been 
shown to affect DAPK1  transcription; however, their 
involvement in AD remains uncharacterized. Current 
evidence shows that the DAPK1 level is post-transcrip -
tionally regulated in AD. In the following, we thus mainly 
focus on the post-transcriptional modulation of DAPK1 
expression in AD.
Hyperactivation of p53 is an important molecular fea -
ture in several neurodegenerative diseases [119]. The 
p53 protein can bind to the first intron of DAPK1  and 
efficiently reinforce the expression of DAPK1 in the  Page 9 of 26
Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
 
presence of pro-apoptotic stimuli [120]. p53 upregulation 
in AD is mainly found in glial cells rather than in neurons 
[121]. Nevertheless, intracellular Aβ species also directly 
activate p53 expression by binding to its promoter [122]. 
Therefore, intracellular Aβ accumulation might upregu -
late DAPK1 expression through p53-mediated pathways.
CREB1 is a well-known transcription factor in neu -
rons. CREB1 is enriched on the promoter of DAPK1  and 
directly suppresses its transcription in the hippocam -
pus. Reduced neuronal CREB expression may result in 
elevated DAPK1 expression and subsequent cell death, 
as has been reported in a rat brain injury model induced 
by cardiac arrest [123]. The CREB signaling is impaired in 
the brains of AD patients, as manifested by a significant 
decline in both total and activated CREB levels in AD 
subjects compared with those in normal controls [124]. 
Thus, the CREB-mediated transcriptional control of 
DAPK1 might be an alternative pathway that modulates 
DAPK1 expression in AD. Contrary to these findings, 
our previous studies established that the upregulation of 
DAPK1 expression in AD is not caused by transcriptional 
changes [78, 79]. These results suggest that the expres -
sion of DAPK1 in AD is likely regulated through both 
transcriptional processes and post-transcriptional path -
ways that are similar to those of the glycogen synthase 
kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and CDK5 [125, 126].
Circadian dysregulation is tightly associated with the 
progression of AD [127]. Melatonin is a master regulator 
of human circadian rhythm and confers numerous bene -
ficial effects on neuronal function [128]. The brain level of 
melatonin is lower in AD patients than in normal controls 
[129]. Since melatonin is capable of preventing tau hyper-
phosphorylation and Aβ accumulation in AD mouse 
models, its downregulation may increase the vulnerabil -
ity to AD [130, 131]. We recently uncovered an inverse 
correlation between brain melatonin level and DAPK1 
expression in AD patients [129]. Furthermore, melatonin 
directly binds to the ankyrin repeats of DAPK1, leading 
to the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degra -
dation of DAPK1 in cells (Fig.  2a) [129]. Our study also 
proved that the melatonin-induced DAPK1 downregula -
tion does not rely on melatonin receptors or DAPK1 gene 
transcription [129]. Indeed, the post-translational regula-
tion of DAPK1 level in the cell is primarily controlled by 
the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways [132]. Several 
binding partners of DAPK1, including HSP90 and DIP-1, 
have been shown to regulate the stability of DAPK1 pro -
tein [47]. Molecular chaperones are key components for 
the maintenance of proteostasis in the cell by monitoring 
the proper folding, maturation and degradation of pro -
teins [133]. With accumulation of intracellular Aβ spe -
cies, molecular chaperones such as HSP90 may function 
to antagonize the cellular stress caused by the excessive 
misfolded proteins [134]. We recently observed that the 
primary neurons incubated with Aβ aggregates have  a 
higher DAPK1 protein level than those without Aβ treat -
ment [135]. However, the DAPK1 mRNA level is not 
altered by Aβ, which is in line with our previous findings 
in brain samples from AD patients [79]. The increased 
DAPK1 protein level by Aβ treatment is attributed to the 
HSP90-mediated stabilization of DAPK1 protein in neu -
rons, as inhibition of HSP90 abolishes the Aβ-induced 
DAPK1 elevation (Fig. 2b) [135].
In addition to the protein stability regulation, DAPK1 
expression may also be affected by various miRNAs. Our 
group has identified two miRNAs, miR-143-3p and miR-
191-5p, as important upstream regulators of DAPK1 
expression in AD. Levels of both miRNAs are significantly 
reduced in brains of AD patients, and are negatively 
correlated with DAPK1 protein level [80, 81]. Moreo -
ver, miR-143-3p and miR-191-5p bind to the 3′ UTR of 
DAPK1 mRNA. Instead of inducing mRNA degradation, 
they block the translation of cellular DAPK1 (Fig. 2c) [80, 
81]. Several other miRNAs have been reported to regu -
late DAPK1 expression in the brain. For instance, DAPK1 
is a target gene of miR-130a-3p. The downregulation of 
miR-130a-3p induced by Aβ treatment promotes DAPK1 
expression, resulting in accelerated neuronal cell death 
and cognitive impairment [136]. MiR-124 binds to the 
3′ UTR of DAPK1  mRNA and affects the translation of 
DAPK1 in ischemic stroke models [137]. In PD, a loss 
of miR-26a leads to an elevation of DAPK1 protein level 
in dopaminergic neurons [82, 138]. Interestingly, it has 
been reported that the level of miR-26a is significantly 
decreased in AD patients and mouse models [139, 140], 
and is closely associated with the cognitive ability in AD 
patients [139]. Therefore, it is expected that miR-26a dys-
regulation may also contribute to the DAPK1 upregula -
tion in AD.
The role of DAPK1 in Alzheimer’s core pathologies
The role of DAPK1 in tau pathology
The abnormal phosphorylation and accumulation of tau 
in the brain is closely associated with the disease course 
of AD, and has been used as a clinical biomarker for dis -
ease diagnosis [141]. Tau has about 85 putative phospho -
rylation sites, and around 50 sites, mostly located in the 
basic C-terminal half of the protein, have been identified 
in brain tissue [141, 142]. Phosphorylation modulates the 
surface charge of tau and its conformation, thus altering 
the inter- and intra-molecular interactions important for 
the physiological functions of tau in neurons [143]. In 
pathological conditions known as tauopathies, neuronal 
tau proteins are hyperphosphorylated at multiple sites, 
leading to the detachment of tau from microtubules and 
subsequent misfolding and aggregation, which ultimately  Page 10 of 26Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
drives microtubule disassembly and the formation of 
pathogenic tau aggregates [7]. It has been noted that the 
aberrant tau phosphorylation in AD is not only char -
acterized by a 3- to 4-fold increase in overall phospho -
rylation level, but also by the presence of various novel 
modified sites not seen in healthy brains [144]. DAPK1 
has been found to be upregulated in brains of hTau 
transgenic mouse models. By overexpressing or knock -
ing down DAPK1 in HEK 293 cells stably expressing 
tau proteins, Duan et  al. found that DAPK1 increases 
tau phosphorylation at Thr231, Ser262 and Ser396 sites 
[113]. Interestingly, DAPK1 has no effect on common 
tau phosphorylating kinases such as GSK-3β, CDK5, 
CaMKII and Cdc2 or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). 
However, DAPK1 overexpression elevates the activ -
ity of microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) 
through direct binding between the death domain of 
DAPK1 and the spacer region of MARK2 [113, 145]. 
MARK2 is known to interact with and phosphorylate 
tau at Ser262 residue [146]. MARK2 knockdown has 
no impact on DAPK1-induced tau hyperphosphoryla -
tion [113], but the MARK2-induced tau phosphoryla -
tion and microtubule destabilization are potentiated by 
DAPK1 in neurons as DAPK1 overexpression enhances 
MARK2 activity in tauopathy [145]. Interestingly, DAPK1 
is able to interact with the tau protein through its kinase 
domain, further leading to tau phosphorylation at Ser262 
[100], promoting dendritic spine damage and neuronal 
death in ischemic stroke mice [100]. Our group further 
identified a novel mechanism by which DAPK1 increases 
neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation 
in AD. We discovered that DAPK1 aggravates neuronal 
tau phosphorylation at Thr231, Ser262 and Ser396 by 
inhibiting the Pin1-mediated cis–trans isomerization 
Fig. 2 Potential molecular mechanisms underlying DAPK1 dysregulation in AD. a Melatonin directly binds to the ankyrin repeats of DAPK1, 
promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in proteasomes. In AD, a downregulation of melatonin in the brain causes a reduction 
of proteasomal-degradation of DAPK1, leading to increased DAPK1 protein levels in the brain. b HSP90 is activated by Aβ accumulation in neurons. 
The activated HSP90 interacts with the kinase domain of DAPK1, resulting in the stabilization and activation of DAPK1 in the brain. c Some miRNAs 
(such as miR-143-3p and miR-191-5p) directly target the 3’ UTR of DAPK1 mRNA, leading to a translational repression of DAPK1 expression. In 
AD, the downregulation of these miRNAs may significantly promote the translation of DAPK1 mRNA, thereby elevating DAPK1 protein contents 
in the brain Page 11 of 26
Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
 
of the pThr231-Pro motif, which is required to maintain 
normal tau functions and turnover (Fig.  3) [79, 147, 148]. 
This unique mechanism was further validated by the 
observation that DAPK1 enhances the protein stability 
of S262A (Ser to Ala) tau mutant, while having no effect 
on the T231A (Thr to Ala) mutant [79]. The DAPK1-
induced tau hyperphosphorylation promotes the forma -
tion of sarkosyl-insoluble tau species (mature pathogenic 
NFTs), disintegrates microtubule structures and prevents 
neurite outgrowth [79]. Besides, the accumulation of cis-
pThr231-tau caused by DAPK1 upregulation robustly 
triggers axonal damage and neuroinflammation in TBI 
mouse model [104]. Our recent study also demonstrated 
that toxic Aβ species facilitate tau hyperphosphorylation 
and accumulation in neurons by upregulating DAPK1 
expression [135]. Inhibition of DAPK1 activity with 
synthetic small molecules antagonizes pathological tau 
phosphorylation and accumulation caused by TBI or Aβ 
species [104, 135].
As a pro-apoptotic kinase, the upregulation of DAPK1 
is believed to stimulate cell apoptosis under stress stimuli. 
However, it has been shown that tau hyperphosphoryla -
tion following DAPK1 activation exerts anti-apoptotic 
effects in N2a cells by blocking the generation of cleaved 
caspase-3 [113]. Previous research has reported that tau 
accumulation and hyperphosphorylation protect cells 
from apoptosis via reducing the p53 level and preserving 
mitochondrial functions [149]. DAPK1 can bind to p53 
via the death domain and phosphorylate the Ser23 resi -
due of p53, further triggering the p53-dependent tran -
scription of apoptotic genes and mitochondrial damage 
in ischemic stroke [101, 150]. The Aβ species-induced 
DAPK1 upregulation in primary neurons leads to both 
tau hyperphosphorylation and caspase-3-mediated apop -
tosis [135]. Thus, it remains debatable as to whether 
DAPK1-induced tau phosphorylation confers anti-apop -
totic effects in neurons. In addition to AD and TBI, it has 
been reported that chronic stress exposure in mice con -
comitantly elevates the expression of DAPK1 and abnor -
mal tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus, which can 
be reversed by exercise training and antidepressant treat-
ment [110]. These results together suggest that DAPK1 
dysregulation indeed causes tau hyperphosphorylation 
and accumulation, and promotes neuronal damage by 
disrupting the microtubule dynamics in AD and other 
neurological disorders.
Fig. 3 DAPK1 dysregulation induces tau hyperphosphorylation and microtubule injury in AD. Neuronal tau is essential for regulating microtubule 
dynamics. DAPK1 dysregulation contributes to tau pathology through two mechanisms. First, DAPK1 interacts with Pin1 and suppresses its activity 
by directly phosphorylating the Ser71 residue of Pin1. Upon phosphorylation, the Pin1-mediated cis-to-trans isomerization of pThr231-Pro motif 
in tau protein is decelerated, leading to the accumulation of cis pT231-tau that is resistant to degradation/dephosphorylation and has lower 
microtubule binding affinity but higher aggregation propensity. Second, it has been reported that DAPK1 directly interacts with tau 
and phosphorylates its Ser262 residue, thereby exacerbating neuronal tau pathologies Page 12 of 26Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
The role of DAPK1 in APP processing, Aβ secretion, 
and Aβ‑induced neurotoxicity
The accumulation and aggregation of Aβ in the brain 
parenchyma is an early pathological change in AD, 
occurring decades prior to the development of clinical 
symptoms [151]. The generation of Aβ by the amyloido -
genic processing of APP is affected by the post-transla -
tional modification of APP in neurons [152]. Notably, 
the phosphorylation of APP in the intracellular domain 
modulates multiple steps of the proteolytic cleavage pro -
cess and has a profound influence on the production of 
Aβ [33]. Eight phosphorylation sites have been identified 
in the cytoplasmic domain of APP thus far, and seven of 
them have been discovered in the brains of AD patients 
[33]. The Thr668 residue of APP (APP695 numbering) 
can be phosphorylated by a variety of kinases related to 
cell proliferation and stress responses [153]. Moreover, 
Thr668 phosphorylation has been proven to be highly 
upregulated in the brains of AD patients compared with 
age-matched controls. The phosphorylation of Thr668 
facilitates the translocation of APP to endosomes, thus 
promoting the colocalization of APP with the β-secretase 
BACE1 [32]. As a consequence, the generation of Aβ is 
dramatically increased in neurons due to the enhanced 
amyloidogenic processing. Recently, we showed that 
DAPK1 interacts with APP through its death domain and 
increases the JNK3-mediated APP phosphorylation at 
Thr668, thereby shifting APP processing toward the amy-
loidogenic pathway (Fig.  4) [78]. DAPK1 strongly pro -
motes the secretion of both Aβ40 and Aβ42, and ablation 
of DAPK1 significantly diminishes the production of Aβ 
in Tg2576 mouse model [78]. Besides, we observed a pos-
itive correlation between DAPK1 protein levels and APP 
phosphorylation at Thr668 in Alzheimer’s patient brains, 
further supporting the role of DAPK1 in regulating the 
amyloid pathology in AD [78]. We additionally revealed 
that pharmacological inhibition of DAPK1 activity by a 
selective DAPK1 inhibitor ((4Z)-4-(3-pyridylmethylene)-
2-styryl-oxazol-5-one) significantly downregulates the 
amyloidogenic processing of APP and Aβ generation in 
different cell models, suggesting that DAPK1 is a promis-
ing target for early intervention of Aβ pathology in AD.
Similar to the pThr231-Pro motif of tau, the pThr668-
Pro motif of APP is also a substrate of Pin1-mediated 
cis–trans isomerization. The phosphorylation of 
Thr668 is essential for the binding between Pin1 and 
APP at the plasma membrane [154]. Pastorino et  al. 
found that Pin1 potently catalyzes the conversion of 
the cis pThr668-Pro APP conformers to the trans  con -
formation which is preferentially favored by the non-
amyloidogenic processing in neurons [154]. Since 
DAPK1 is known to phosphorylate Ser71 of Pin1 and 
inhibits the prolyl isomerase activity [57], we speculate 
that the DAPK1-induced APP phosphorylation and the 
cis pThr668-Pro APP accumulation caused by DAPK1-
induced Pin1 suppression both contribute to the exces -
sive generation of Aβ in AD.
In addition to affecting APP processing and Aβ gen -
eration, DAPK1 dysregulation is also involved in medi -
ating Aβ neurotoxicity in the brain. The self-assembly 
of Aβ into soluble oligomers has been recognized as a 
main culprit for Aβ-related neuropathological changes 
[155]. Low-molecular-weight Aβ species activate 
DAPK1 by inducing the dephosphorylation of Ser308 
and trigger caspase-3-dependent neuronal cell death 
[156]. We recently demonstrated that both low- and 
high-molecular-weight Aβ species upregulate DAPK1 
protein levels in neurons and cause extensive neu -
ronal apoptosis [135]. Additionally, the upregulation 
of DAPK1 by Aβ oligomers leads to  Ca2+ overload and 
excitotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cell line via phospho -
rylation of the Ser1303 residue of the NMDAR GluN2B 
subunit, resembling the effect observed in an ischemic 
stroke mouse model [73, 111]. Neuroinflammation is 
another prominent pathological change in AD, char -
acterized by the presence of gliosis and abundant pro-
inflammatory cytokines in cortex and hippocampus. 
Song et al. found that the Aβ species stimulate DAPK1 
activity in BV2 microglial cell line via activating the 
lysosomal cathepsin B [157], thereby promoting the 
generation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and subsequent 
cognitive impairments in vitro and in vivo [157].
Fig. 4 DAPK1 dysregulation triggers APP phosphorylation 
and enhances the amyloidogenic processing pathway. DAPK1 is able 
to interact with APP in neurons, and potentiates the JNK3-induced 
APP phosphorylation at the Thr668 residue. Phosphorylated APP 
translocates to the endosomes and undergoes the amyloidogenic 
cleavage by BACE1 and γ-secretases sequentially. The generation 
of Aβ is thus enhanced, leading to the pronounced formation 
of amyloid plaques in the brain Page 13 of 26

DAPK1 and neuronal cell death in AD
Neuronal cell death is commonly observed during neu -
ral development and pathological conditions [158]. The 
programmed cell death in the developmental period con-
tributes to the elimination of redundant neurons, which 
is crucial for the establishment of functional neural cir -
cuits and the maintenance of normal organ size [158]. 
The developmental cell death occurs in a spatiotempo -
rally restricted and well-controlled manner to regulate 
the functional and structural homeostasis in the brain 
[159]. However, abnormal cell death in specific neuronal 
populations is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenera -
tive diseases including AD, and is closely associated with 
functional and structural impairments during disease 
progression [3]. For example, cholinergic neurons in the 
basal forebrain are a primary cluster of neurons forming 
neural connections with the cortex, hippocampus and 
amygdala [160]. They regulate a wide range of physiologi-
cal functions such as learning and memory, attention and 
emotion [161]. In pathological conditions such as AD, 
cholinergic neurons undergo irreversible degeneration 
and cell death, ultimately leading to brain atrophy and 
cognitive decline [162]. The specific spatial and temporal 
expression of DAPK1 in the brain implicates a potential 
role of DAPK1 in regulating neuronal cell apoptosis dur -
ing neural development [39, 163], yet systematic research 
is needed to fully reveal the exact role of DAPK1 in early 
brain development. Surprisingly, we and others noticed 
that whole-body DAPK1  knockout (KO) in mouse has 
minimal influence on the overall lifespan and brain 
morphology [164]. Besides, DAPK1 KO or kinase activ -
ity deficiency in mice does not cause behavioral deficits 
[104, 165]. These findings indicate that the physiological 
role of DAPK1 in neural development might be compen -
sated by other mechanisms in KO mouse models, but this 
needs further evidence.
The dysregulation of DAPK1 in neuronal cell death 
was first demonstrated in ischemic stroke. Activated 
DAPK1 phosphorylates the Ser1303 residue of GluN2B 
at extrasynaptic sites, leading to enhanced NMDAR 
channel conductance and subsequent  Ca2+ influx 
in neurons (Fig.  5a) [73]. Blocking DAPK1 rescues 
the  Ca2+ overload-induced ischemic neuronal death 
and brain damage [73]. The excitotoxicity of GluN2B 
phosphorylation elicited by DAPK1 activation is also 
involved in neuronal loss caused by epilepsy, toxic Aβ 
treatment, stress-related depression and TBI insult 
[76, 77, 105, 109]. An earlier study demonstrated that 
DAPK1 binds to and phosphorylates p53 at the Ser23 
residue. Upon the Ser23 phosphorylation, p53 trans -
locates to the nucleus to initiate pro-apoptotic gene 
transcription. In addition, phosphorylated p53 also 
interacts with cyclophilin D in mitochondria and evokes 
mitochondrion-dependent necrosis (Fig.  5b) [101]. 
Fig. 5 DAPK1 dysregulation leads to neuronal cell death through multiple pathways. a DAPK1 interacts with the GluN2B subunit of extrasynaptic 
NMDAR and phosphorylates the Ser1303 of GluN2B, thereby elevating the channel conductance of NMDAR toward  Ca2+. Ultimately, 
neurons experience extensive excitotoxicity and undergo apoptosis due to  Ca2+ overload. b DAPK1 directly phosphorylates the Ser23 of p53. 
Phosphorylated p53 enters cell nucleus to promote the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax and Puma, leading to neuronal cell death 
in ischemic stroke. Besides, it can anchor to mitochondrial membranes and disrupt membrane integrity by interacting with the cyclophilin D (Cyp 
D), causing the release of cytochrome c and the generation of cle-caspase-3. c DAPK1 upregulation causes the phosphorylation of the Ser350 
residue of NDRG2, resulting in the activation of caspase-3-dependent neuronal cell death Page 14 of 26Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
Previous studies have shown that DAPK1 can trigger 
both cell apoptosis and autophagic cell death [166]. A 
notable feature of DAPK1-induced cell death is cellu -
lar morphological changes such as membrane blebbing 
and cell protrusion, which are attributed to the phos -
phorylation of myosin-II light chain at Ser19 by DAPK1 
and the subsequent alterations in cytoskeletal structure 
[166, 167]. We also identified N-myc downstream-reg -
ulated gene 2 (NDRG2) as a novel DAPK1 substrate in 
regulating neuronal cell death [168]. DAPK1 interacts 
with NDRG2 via its cytoskeleton-binding region, and 
directly phosphorylates the Ser350 of NDRG2 [168]. 
DAPK1-induced NDRG2 phosphorylation mediates the 
neuronal cell apoptosis triggered by Aβ species or cera -
mide through activating the caspase-3 pathway (Fig.  5c) 
[168]. Furthermore, NDRG2 phosphorylation at Ser350 
is significantly elevated in the Tg2576 mouse model 
and in  hippocampal tissues of AD patients. DAPK1 
KO successfully reverses hippocampal neuronal loss 
in 8-month-old Tg2576 mice [168]. These findings 
support a causal role of DAPK1 dysregulation in AD-
related neuronal cell death.
Dysregulation of sphingomyelin has been suggested to 
be associated with the progression of cognitive decline 
and hippocampal atrophy in AD [169]. Ceramide is a 
metabolite from enzymatic cleavage of sphingomyelin 
in neurons and regulates a broad range of cellular events 
including senescence, survival, and apoptosis [170]. Brain 
regions with degenerative phenotypes show elevated cer -
amide content. The accumulation of ceramide has been 
shown to activate DAPK1 by inducing PP2A-mediated 
dephosphorylation of the Ser308 residue, thereby caus -
ing hippocampal neuronal death [171, 172]. In addition 
to sphingomyelin dyshomeostasis, the missense mutation 
(T835M) of the netrin receptor uncoordinated-5 homo -
logue C (UNC5C) contributes to the risk of LOAD by 
increasing the vulnerability of neurons to cell death with-
out affecting Aβ pathologies [173]. Hashimoto et al. dem-
onstrated that the T835M-UNC5C interacts with DAPK1 
via the respective death domain and induces pronounced 
cell death by activating the JNK/NADPH oxidase/caspase 
pathway [ 174]. Pharmacological inhibition of DAPK1 
activity attenuates the T835M-UNC5C-induced cell 
death, suggesting that the interaction between UNC5C 
and DAPK1 may upregulate the catalytic activity of 
DAPK1 [174]. Indeed, it has been revealed that the Unc-5 
homolog 2, a member of the UNC5 family, interacts with 
DAPK1 and recruits a subunit of PP2A to dephospho -
rylate the Ser308 residue of DAPK1, leading to DAPK1 
activation and extensive cell death [175, 176]. Thus, these 
results all corroborate the fundamental role of DAPK1 
in modulating neuronal cell death in the pathogenesis of 
AD.
The role of DAPK1 in synaptic functions in AD
Synapses are the structural unit for neuronal communica-
tions and form the functional basis for neural circuits that 
are vital for brain function. The progressive degeneration 
of synapses in the brain is highly correlated with cogni -
tive decline in AD [177], and is an emerging therapeutic 
target for disease-modifying treatment of AD. The high 
abundance of DAPK1 in adult hippocampal tissues and in 
particular its enrichment in dendritic spines indicate that 
DAPK1 may possess important physiological functions in 
regulating synaptic structure and plasticity [73, 164]. This 
has been confirmed by our recent quantitative proteomic 
and phosphoproteomic analyses of hippocampal tissues 
from WT and DAPK1  KO mice [178]. Glutamate recep -
tors are one of the major modulators of the synaptic  Ca2+ 
influx in neurons [179]. NMDARs dynamically change 
their subcellular localization, trafficking and expression 
levels in reaction to neuronal activities, and are believed 
to be critical for long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-
term depression (LTD) [180]. Importantly, the DAPK1-
induced Ser1303 phosphorylation of the NMDAR 
GluN2B subunit, which was originally reported to be 
detrimental in ischemic stroke, has essential physiologi -
cal functions in modulating LTP and LTD (Fig.  6a) [181]. 
It has been revealed that DAPK1 and CaMKII differen -
tially bind to GluN2B in LTD and LTP , respectively. LTP 
stimuli induce high levels of cellular  Ca2+/CaM that can 
disrupt the binding between DAPK1 and GluN2B while 
facilitating the interaction between CaMKII and GluN2B. 
Besides, DAPK1 is dispersed from dendritic spines dur -
ing LTP due to the transient depolymerization of F-actin 
[72, 181]. However, LTD stimuli trigger the calcineu -
rin-mediated DAPK1 activation by dephosphorylating 
the Ser308 residue. This then causes an increase in the 
DAPK1–GluN2B interaction and subsequent phospho -
rylation of the Ser1303 residue, which retains DAPK1 
in dendritic spines but prevents the access of CaMKII to 
GluN2B [72, 181]. It should be mentioned that the tran -
sient activation of DAPK1 is required for LTD induc -
tion under physiological conditions, which differs from 
the sustained upregulation of DAPK1 in ischemic stroke 
or AD [181]. Excessive DAPK1 in the synapse may pro -
hibit the synaptic accumulation of CaMKII and result 
in LTP deficits in the brain. Aβ aggregates induce pro -
longed upregulation of DAPK1 in primary neurons [135], 
which may further mediate the NMDAR overactivation-
induced  Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and excitotoxicity in AD 
brains. Shu et al. demonstrated that DAPK1 is selectively 
activated in excitatory pyramidal neurons of the entorhi -
nal cortical layer II region  (ECIIPN) prior to the appear -
ance of Aβ deposition [112]. The activation of DAPK1 
in this brain region is strongly involved in synaptic dys -
function manifested by significantly reduced presynaptic  Page 15 of 26
Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
 
terminals and dendritic spines, and disordered excita -
tory and inhibitory balance in CA1 region [112]. Inhibi -
tion of DAPK1 activity in  ECIIPN potently improves the 
synaptic transmission and cognitive performance of AD 
mice [112]. Therefore, DAPK1 may contribute to synap -
tic degeneration during AD progression irrespective of 
the presence of Aβ species through different molecular 
mechanisms.
DAPK1 has also been shown to interact with several 
presynaptic proteins including Caytaxin, Syntaxin-1A 
and α-synuclein (α-syn) [71, 108, 182]. For example, the 
upregulation of DAPK1 during brain ageing is associ -
ated with a downregulation of presynaptic Caytaxin 
levels, which is likely mediated by the DAPK1-induced 
caspase-3 activation [118]. A loss of Caytaxin expression 
significantly impairs the frequency and the amplitude of 
neuronal miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and 
weakens hippocampal LTP in vivo (Fig.  6b) [118]. Inter -
estingly, the interaction between DAPK1 and Caytaxin 
also reciprocally inhibits the presynaptic DAPK1 activ -
ity and protects neurons against the ischemic stroke-
induced apoptosis [182], representing an early protective 
mechanism by which neurons antagonize ischemic brain 
injuries. Syntaxin-1A is a basic component in the regu -
lation of neurotransmitter release. It participates in the 
synaptic vesicle docking and fusion process by cooperat -
ing with other proteins in the SNARE complex [183, 184]. 
Tian et al. found that DAPK1 associates with the C-ter -
minal half of Syntaxin-1A in the plasma membrane, and 
phosphorylates its Ser188 residue in a  Ca2+-dependent 
manner. The phosphorylated Syntaxin 1A has reduced 
binding affinity to Munc18, while the assembly of the 
SNARE complex is not affected [71].
α-Syn is another binding partner of synaptic vesicles in 
neurons and is closely associated with the pathogenesis 
of PD. DAPK1 phosphorylates α-syn at the Ser129 resi -
due, promoting the self-aggregation of α-syn into toxic 
species both in  vitro and in  vivo [82, 108]. However, it 
is not clear how the DAPK1-induced α-syn alteration 
modulates synaptic functions. Goodell et al. revealed that 
DAPK1 KO mice have comparable LTP strength to that 
of WT mice, while the LTD level is enhanced at a young 
age [164]. Functional studies demonstrated that DAPK1  
KO mice have different presynaptic components in hip -
pocampus compared with the WT mice, as evidenced by 
the increased paired-pulse ratio and reduced glutamate 
release probability in the hippocampus of KO mice [164]. 
Our transcriptomic analysis in DAPK1 KO and WT 
mice suggested that DAPK1 ablation globally changes 
the transcriptional profile in multiple brain regions and 
significantly regulates genes related to glutamatergic 
and GABAergic synaptic pathways [185]. The potential 
involvement of DAPK1 in modulating synaptic transmis -
sion and plasticity hints that DAPK1 dysregulation in AD 
Fig. 6 The role of DAPK1 in regulating synaptic functions. a DAPK1 is enriched in neuronal synapses, and is physiologically involved 
in the modulation of synaptic plasticity by interacting with the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR. During LTP , high levels of  Ca2+/CaM suppress 
the DAPK1-induced phosphorylation of GluN2B, which then facilitates the binding between CaMKII and NMDAR and potentiates LTP formation. 
However, in LTD, DAPK1 is activated by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of Ser308 residue, leading to an upregulation of GluN2B 
phosphorylation at Ser1303 that is necessary for the formation of LTD. b It has also been reported that DAPK1 is hyperactivated in the hippocampus 
during brain ageing. The activation of DAPK1 results in caspase-3-dependent Caytaxin degradation in presynapses, further affecting synaptic 
neurotransmission and the formation of LTP Page 16 of 26Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
may additionally cause synaptic impairments. However, 
in vivo studies using both DAPK1  KO and transgenic AD 
mouse models are needed to fully address how DAPK1 is 
involved in synaptic deficits during AD progression.
DAPK1 and other AD pathological changes
The progression of AD is also accompanied by glio -
sis, chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and 
autophagy deficiency [186]. The sustained activation 
of glial cells in the brain not only leads to an imbalance 
in pro- and anti-inflammatory signals, but also impairs 
the clearance of debris and protein aggregates, and dis -
rupts synaptic integrity [187, 188]. Therefore, the man -
agement of gliosis represents a promising approach to 
counteracting neuroinflammatory response in AD [189]. 
Previous research indicated that DAPK1 expression is 
rather low or undetectable in glial cells at the embryonic 
stage [39]. However, the expression pattern of DAPK1 
in glial cells in the adult brain or in response to exter -
nal stimuli remains uncharacterized. Song et  al. found 
that DAPK1 is expressed in the BV2 murine microglial 
cell line. The activity of DAPK1 but not its protein level 
can be upregulated by Aβ treatment in lipopolysaccha -
ride-primed BV2 cells [157]. The activation of DAPK1 
promotes the production of IL-1β and the initiation of 
caspase 1-mediated activation of the NOD-, LRR- and 
pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, fur -
ther leading to memory deficits in mouse models [157]. 
The Aβ treatment-induced activation of DAPK1 may be 
attributed to the elevation of cytosolic cathepsin B, which 
is able to interact with DAPK1 and slow down the turno -
ver of endogenous DAPK1 [157, 190]. Pharmacological 
inhibition of DAPK1 activity attenuates the Aβ-induced 
NLRP3 activation and cognitive impairment in  vivo. 
These findings implicate that modulating DAPK1 func -
tion in microglia might have protective effects on AD-
related chronic neuroinflammation.
In addition to regulating the inflammatory response, 
microglia are also actively involved in maintaining 
brain homeostasis by executing phagocytosis of redun -
dant synapses, damaged cells, myelin debris and pro -
tein aggregates [191]. It has been demonstrated that 
the autophagy-lysosomal system, an essential cellular 
machinery for the phagocytosis process, is impaired in 
the microglia of AD mouse models [192–194]. DAPK1 
is an upstream regulator of cellular autophagy that 
directly interacts with proteins involved in the autophagy 
machinery. For instance, DAPK1 phosphorylates the 
Thr119 of Beclin1, and thus facilitates the release of Bec -
lin1 from Bcl-X L to initiate the autophagy process [195, 
196]. Besides, it has been reported that DAPK1 forms a 
stable complex with MAP1B in cells subjected to star -
vation. MAP1B is indispensable for DAPK1-induced 
autophagosome accumulation and membrane blebbing 
[197, 198]. Oikonomou et  al. discovered a novel role of 
DAPK1 in affecting the LC3-associated phagocytosis 
(LAP , also known as noncanonical autophagy) in fungal 
infection-related inflammation by modulating the forma-
tion of autophagosomes [199]. Interestingly, the LAP is 
an essential part of microglial phagocytosis in the brain. 
Chen et al. demonstrated that DAPK1 is also involved in 
the regulation of LAP in the microglia using an in vitro 
subarachnoid hemorrhage model by exposing microglial 
cells to oxyhemoglobin [200]. Oxyhemoglobin suppresses 
microglial LAP by upregulating p38 and downregulating 
DAPK1, further resulting in a reduction of cellular Bec -
lin1 expression [200]. These data concomitantly support 
a crucial role of DAPK1 in cellular autophagy. Neverthe -
less, whether DAPK1 dysregulation is associated with 
autophagy impairment in AD is yet unresolved. Only 
one study reported that Aβ treatment activates neu -
ronal DAPK1 and triggers autophagosome formation and 
apoptosis sequentially in primary neurons [156]. Impor -
tantly, neurons with high amounts of autophagosomes 
are devoid of apoptotic phenotypes [156], which suggests 
that the DAPK1-inducced autophagy might confer pro -
tection in AD. Taken together, the function of DAPK1 in 
microglia appears to be contradictory, as DAPK1 activa -
tion may stimulate inflammatory response, but it may 
also enhance autophagy to maintain cellular homeostasis.
DAPK1 as a target for disease‑modifying treatment 
of AD
Given the multiple roles of DAPK1 dysregulation in the 
pathogenesis of AD, DAPK1 has been an emerging target 
for the development of novel disease-modifying therapies 
for AD. Several types of molecule, including synthetic 
compounds, natural product-derived chemicals and pep -
tide-based modulators have been tested in mouse models 
to evaluate the therapeutic potential of DAPK1 inhibition 
in various neuropathologies [201].
Synthetic small‑molecule DAPK1 modulators
The first small-molecule DAPK1 inhibitor was identi -
fied by screening a library of compounds, leading to the 
discovery of an aminopyridazine with a weak DAPK1 
inhibitory effect [202]. Further structural optimization 
of the lead compounds resulted in the generation of two 
3-amino-6-phenylpyridazine derivatives with remark -
ably improved inhibition and selectivity for DAPK1 
 (IC50 =  ~ 15  μM) [202]. These compounds have a com -
mon 6-phenyl group and competitively bind to the ATP-
binding pocket of DAPK1. An in  vivo study using a 
hypoxic ischemia rat model demonstrated that a single 
intraperitoneal injection of the candidate compound  Page 17 of 26
Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
 
successfully ameliorated brain weight loss and preserved 
microtubule-associated proteins in the brain [202].
Okamoto et  al. performed a structure-based virtual 
screening using the structures of target protein kinases, 
and identified a series of compounds with a common 
scaffold of 2-phenyl-4-(3-pyridinylmethylene)-5(4H)-
oxazolone [203]. The pyridinyl group, the oxazolone ring 
and the phenyl ring in the scaffold are all essential for 
the inhibition of DAPK1 and DAPK3 activities based on 
the structure–activity relationship analysis [203]. More 
importantly, compounds with this scaffold are highly 
selective for DAPKs, facilitating the discovery of mol -
ecules with improved affinity. To discover novel DAPK1 
inhibitors, Okamoto et  al. carried out a multiple-step 
virtual screening, in which they first generated several 
binding-site models using molecular dynamics simula -
tion to select structures with the highest enrichment, 
and then large-scale screening was performed based on 
the enriched DAPK1 structure [204]. Following the dis -
covery of the lead compound, in vitro kinase assays and 
similarity search of more potent compounds were per -
formed to obtain the optimal chemicals. This led to the 
discovery of 4-(pyridin-3-ylmethylene)oxazol-5(4H)-one 
(C6) [204], a highly efficient inhibitor for DAPK1 and 
DAPK3  (IC50 = 69 and 225  nM, respectively). This com -
pound has been widely used in animal studies due to its 
strong inhibitory effect and high specificity for DAPK1. 
For example, we have shown that C6 is capable of reduc -
ing the secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the low nanomolar 
range [78]. Besides, C6 effectively prevents the ceramide- 
and Aβ aggregate-induced neuronal cell death [168]. 
In an epileptic mouse model, C6 treatment protected 
against the PTZ-induced seizures by diminishing the 
DAPK1-induced GluN2B phosphorylation [76].
Feng et  al. designed a group of octahedral pyridocar -
bazole metal complexes based on the structure of the 
pan-kinase inhibitor Staurosporine [205]. The specific 
inhibitor OS4 contains ruthenium in the 1,4,7-trithi -
ocycloalkane scaffold. Crystallographic analysis revealed 
extensive interactions between OS4 and the catalytic 
domain of DAPK1, including hydrogen bonds between 
the maleimide moiety and the hinge region of DAPK1, 
hydrophobic interactions between the 1,4,7-trithiacy -
clononane ligand group and the ATP-binding site and 
glycine-rich loop of DAPK1, and the occupation of the 
pyridocarbazole heterocycle in the adenine pocket of 
DAPK1 [205]. The  IC50 values of OS4 for DAPK1 and 
DAPK3 are 2 and 8.8  nM, respectively. In addition, it 
preferentially inhibited DAPK1 activity with a selective 
factor higher than 4.4 in the kinase screening assay [205].
Carlson et  al. applied a fluorescence-linked enzyme 
chemoproteomic strategy and found that HS38, a selec -
tive pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidinone, can potently suppress 
DAPK1 and DAPK3 with an  IC50 of about 200 nM [206]. 
The inhibition of DAPK3 by HS38 leads to reduced con -
tractile force in mouse aorta and calyculin A-stimulated 
arterial muscle via decreasing the phosphorylation of 
regulatory myosin light chain (RLC20) [206]. Neverthe -
less, it is not clear how this compound regulates DAPK1 
activity in ischemic stroke or other neurological disease 
models.
Singh et  al. conducted virtual screening and molecu -
lar simulations to identify compounds that can simulta -
neously occupy the ATP-binding site and the substrate 
recognition site of DAPK1, which led to the discovery of 
the compound 11 as a promising inhibitor that directly 
interacts with the Glu100 and Glu143 residues of DAPK1 
[207]. Furthermore, the prediction of drug-likeness also 
showed higher druggability and safety profile of the com -
pound 11 than other compounds [207].
To target neuronal tauopathy, Farag et  al. designed a 
dual inhibitor for DAPK1 and colony-stimulating fac -
tor 1 receptor (CSF1R) with a 3,5-dimethoxy-N-(4-(4-
methoxyphenoxy)-2-((6-morpholinopyridin-3-yl)amino)
pyrimidin-5-yl)benzamide structure [208]. This com -
pound suppresses DAPK1 activity in a non-ATP com -
petitive manner, as it binds to the substrate-binding 
site rather than the ATP-binding pocket of DAPK1. The 
 IC50 value slightly decreased from 2.89 to 0.92 μM with 
the increase of ATP concentration in the in vitro kinase 
assay [208]. In addition, it also strongly inhibits the activ -
ity of CSF1R by competing with ATP . In vitro evaluation 
proved that the compound efficiently suppresses tau 
aggregation and lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroin -
flammation [208]. This compound is also highly selective 
toward DAPK1, despite the sequence homology between 
DAPK1 and other DAPK family members [208]. Moreo -
ver, this molecule might show encouraging neuroprotec -
tive effects due to its high BBB permeability and brain 
bioavailability [208].
Recently, rational design and synthesis of aryl carboxa -
mide derivatives have led to the generation of an isonico -
tinamide derivative 4q as a promising DAPK1 inhibitor 
with an  IC50 value of 1.09 μM [209]. The compound has 
been tested for anti-cancer activity in leukemia and breast 
cancer, while its effects on neuropathologies remain to be 
investigated [209]. Similarly, some 6,8,9-poly-substituted 
purine derivatives have been able to prevent leukemia 
cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by suppressing 
DAPK1 activity. Further structure optimization led to the 
discovery of 6-benzyloxy-9-tert-butyl-8-phenyl-9H-pu -
rine (compound 6d), an efficient DAPK1 inhibitor with 
an  IC50 value of 2.5  μM [210]. Wilbek et  al. performed 
high-throughput screening of novel DAPK1 inhibitors 
by applying a microfluidic capillary electrophoresis assay 
based on the DAPK1-induced specific phosphorylation  Page 18 of 26Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
of the Ser1303 residue of DAPK1 [211]. The identified 
compound (CPR005231) binds to the ATP pocket of 
DAPK1 at nanomolar concentrations and has an  IC50 of 
247 nM for DAPK1 [211]. However, this compound also 
inhibits the protein-tyrosine kinase Src at a similar  IC50 
[211]. Firoz et  al. performed an in silico study aimed at 
obtaining DAPK1 inhibitors for the treatment of retinal 
degeneration, as studies suggested that DAPK1 contrib -
utes to ophthalmic disorders in large part by regulating 
the programmed cell death. They found several caspase 
inhibitor analogs with good inhibitory effects and prom -
ising drug-likeness properties [212].
In conclusion, a number of in silico studies have been 
performed to discover specific DAPK1 inhibitors, and 
indeed compounds with different scaffolds have been 
identified and tested in in  vitro kinase assays. Although 
many studies usually include drug-likeness prediction 
which could provide some hints for further in vivo evalu -
ation, animal experiments are urgently needed to better 
determine the effectiveness, pharmacokinetics and safety 
profiles of these small-molecule DAPK1 inhibitors.
Natural compounds as DAPK1 modulators
Natural compounds represent an important resource 
for the discovery of therapeutic chemicals for various 
neurological diseases. Flavonoids are widely distrib -
uted bioactive molecules in nature and possess diverse 
biological effects such as anti-oxidative stress and anti-
inflammation by interacting with key signaling molecules 
in the cell [213]. Yokoyama et al. first measured the bind-
ing affinity of 17 natural flavonoids to DAPK1 using the 
1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) competitive 
assay. Of all the tested flavonoids, morin, a natural poly -
phenol abundantly found in Moraceae species, showed 
the highest binding affinity toward the DAPK1 catalytic 
domain  (IC50 = 1.6 ± 0.27  µM) in the ANS assay [214]. 
Crystallographic analysis revealed that these flavonoids 
mainly bind to the ATP pocket of DAPK1. In particular, 
it has been found that the 2’–OH of morin forms strong 
ionic interaction with the K42 residue of DAPK1, which 
underlies the robust inhibitory effect of morin on DAPK1 
activity.
Resveratrol is a polyphenol ubiquitously found in 
grapes. It is a well-known dietary supplement due to its 
cardiovascular protective activity. Resveratrol directly 
binds to the ATP pocket of DAPK1 with an apparent dis -
sociation constant of 8.5 μM [215, 216]. Specifically, the 
phenyl ring (A-ring) of resveratrol anchors at the ade -
nyl base of ATP and the 3-OH group forms hydrogen 
bonds with the hinge region of DAPK1 [215]. Based on 
the binding mode, Yokoyama et  al. further character -
ized several resveratrol derivatives using conventional 
biophysical approaches. Thermodynamic analysis of the 
binding suggested that the interaction between resvera -
trol derivatives and DAPK1 is mainly driven by favora -
ble enthalpy changes due to the formation of hydrogen 
bonds and van der Waals interactions [216]. These deriv -
atives all dock to the ATP pocket of DAPK1, and addi -
tional hydrogen bonds can be formed in the hinge region 
of DAPK1 [216]. A similar binding mode was reported 
for Purpurin, an anthraquinone isolated from the roots 
of Rubia cordifolia, for its interaction with DAPK1 [217]. 
The  IC50 value of Purpurin for DAPK1 was determined to 
be 890 nM [217]. Talwar et al. carried out virtual screen -
ing in combination with in vitro kinase assay to discover 
DAPK1 inhibitors from the ZINC database [218]. The 
compound-N4 binds to the ATP pocket and the substrate 
recognition site of DAPK1 [218].
Quercetin is a ubiquitously distributed BBB-permeable 
flavonoid. Qi et  al. identified DAPK1 as a downstream 
target of Quercetin using a systematic approach [219]. 
Very interestingly, they observed that HT-22 cells treated 
with Aβ species showed an increase in DAPK1 mRNA 
expression which is consistent with their microarray 
analysis of the GSE5281 dataset, and Quercetin treat -
ment dramatically suppressed this increase [219]. This 
finding indicates that Quercetin is likely beneficial for 
ischemic stroke and AD by indirectly targeting DAPK1. 
In all, although biophysical and crystallographic data 
support the idea that these natural compounds directly 
bind to DAPK1, it remains elusive whether these mol -
ecules indeed exert protective effects through inhibiting 
DAPK1 in vitro and in vivo.
There are also natural compounds that can upregulate 
DAPK1 function in cells. For instance, Sanggenon C is 
able to decrease the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase 
Mind-bomb 1 (Mib1, also known as DIP-1), an important 
binding partner controlling the degradation of DAPK1 
in the cell [52, 53]. Sanggenon C upregulates the cellu -
lar DAPK1 level by stabilizing the protein, leading to cell 
cycle arrest and apoptosis in glioblastoma model [220]. 
Grifolin has been reported to upregulate the cellular p53 
function and promote the transcription and expression of 
DAPK1 in breast cancer cell lines, thus promoting cancer 
cell death [221]. Curcumin has also been shown to cause 
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells by upregu -
lating DAPK1 transcription and its protein level [222]. 
Notably, these data are mostly obtained using cancer 
cell lines and it is not clear whether these molecules also 
show similar effects in neuronal cells.
Peptide‑based DAPK1 modulators
Many of the biological functions of DAPK1 are medi -
ated by its cellular substrates. Specific amino acids 
or sequences involved in the recognition and binding 
events can therefore be utilized to design peptide-based  Page 19 of 26
Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
 
blockers to interfere with DAPK1 dysregulation-induced 
pathological changes. This method has several advan -
tages over small-molecule inhibitors. First, peptide-based 
blockers are highly selective and specific toward the pro -
tein targets and their substrates. Second, peptide-based 
blockers can be easily modified to increase the inhibition 
potency and biological diversity [223]. Third, the metabo-
lism of peptides generates amino acids with low cellular 
toxicities [224]. Nevertheless, peptide-based compounds 
are susceptible to rapid proteolysis and insufficient mem-
brane penetration in  vivo, which hinder their transla -
tional applications in neurological diseases [225]. In this 
part, we will discuss the use of blocking peptides as a tool 
to specifically disrupt DAPK1–substrate interactions for 
disease intervention.
The blocking peptide approach was initially employed 
by Tu et al. to block the interaction between DAPK1 and 
GluN2B in an ischemic stroke mouse model [73]. In their 
study, the direct binding sequence of GluN2B (1292–1304 
aa) was fused to the cell-membrane transduction domain 
of the HIV-1 Tat protein (Tat-NR2BCT) [73]. This peptide 
completely abolished the interaction between DAPK1 
and GluN2B in neurons, thereby resulting in reduced 
GluN2B phosphorylation and subsequent  Ca2+ influx in 
mouse brain [73]. Furthermore, the Tat-NR2B CT treat -
ment was sufficient to improve ischemic stroke-induced 
brain infarction and chronic stress-induced depressive-
like behaviors in  vivo [73, 109]. The same group also 
identified a minimal binding sequence in the DNA-
binding motif of p53 that is responsible for the interac -
tion with the death domain of DAPK1. The fragment was 
conjugated with the cell-membrane transduction domain 
of Tat protein to generate a blocking peptide Tat-p53DM, 
which has been shown to suppress DAPK1-induced p53 
phosphorylation in cortical neurons subjected to oxy -
gen–glucose deprivation [101]. Moreover, intravenous 
injection of the peptide not only rescued brain infarction 
and neuronal cell death, but also reversed motor deficits 
in ischemic stroke mouse model [150]. The interaction 
between DAPK1 and tau can also be prevented by using 
a membrane-permeable peptide containing the minimal 
tau-binding sequence [100]. The peptide can cross the 
BBB when administered intravenously. It is capable of 
ameliorating stroke-induced dendritic spine damage and 
cognitive injuries by attenuating the DAPK1-induced tau 
phosphorylation in neurons [100]. Inspired by this, our 
group also developed a specific blocking peptide (Tat-
DM) for the interaction between ERK and DAPK1. This 
peptide interrupts ERK-induced DAPK1 phosphorylation 
at Ser735 by uncoupling the binding between these two 
proteins, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of DAPK1 
[77]. Treatment of Tat-DM successfully reduced neuronal 
apoptosis and suppressed seizure severity in KA-induced 
mouse epilepsy model in vivo by downregulating DAPK1 
activity in the brain [77]. These data together demon -
strate the promising application of peptide-based DAPK1 
modulators in the intervention of neurological diseases. 
They are not only robust tools for research purposes, but 
also possess translational potential for clinical applica -
tions. However, peptides usually suffer from low biosta -
bility and poor BBB permeability in vivo, which strongly 
limit the bioavailability and efficacy of peptide-based 
therapeutics in human brains [226]. Strategies such as 
peptidomimetics, chemical modifications and bionano -
technology-based delivery systems might be applied to 
overcome these drawbacks [223].
Perspectives regarding the development of DAPK1 
modulators
Protein kinases are valuable therapeutic targets for the 
intervention of AD, not only due to the direct participa -
tion of dysregulated kinases in various AD pathologies, 
but also because of the vast number of chemicals and 
strategies available for drug development [227]. Com -
pounds targeting GSK-3β, CDK5, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, 
JNK3 or several tyrosine kinases have been evaluated 
in AD mouse models, and some of them have reached 
clinical trials [228]. For instance, short-term (10  weeks) 
treatment of lithium, a GSK-3β inhibitor, had no impact 
on CSF biomarkers and cognitive performance in AD 
patients. However, a prolonged treatment of lithium 
(over 12 months) in patients with mild cognitive impair -
ment led to improved cognitive function and reduced 
tau phosphorylation with favorable safety profiles [229, 
230]. Tideglusib, another GSK-3β inhibitor that has been 
evaluated in a 26-week, multicenter phase II clinical 
trial, also demonstrated positive effects on cognitive per -
formance in patients with mild AD [231]. Other kinase 
inhibitors such as Neflamapimod for p38 MAPK and 
NE3107 for ERK1/2 are being analyzed in AD patients 
and have shown promising results in phase II clinical 
trials [227]. However, CDK5 or JNK3 inhibitors are less 
investigated in clinical trials although these kinases play 
a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD. CDK5 and JNK3 
are crucial for cellular signaling transduction, mean -
ing that non-selective suppression of the activities of the 
kinases may induce toxic rather than therapeutic effects 
in AD patients [232].
The extensive involvement of DAPK1 in regulating 
multiple AD pathological changes makes it an ideal 
target for the development of disease-modifying treat -
ments for AD. Indeed, several synthetic DAPK1 inhibi -
tors and blocking peptides have already been exploited 
in AD or stroke mouse models for disease intervention. 
The neuroprotective effect of DAPK1 inhibition on 
ischemic stroke has been systematically summarized  Page 20 of 26Zhang et al. Translational Neurodegeneration            (2024) 13:4 
by Khan et al. [233]. In their study, they compared the 
effects of different approaches in inhibiting neuronal 
DAPK1 function, including gene knockout, post-tran -
scriptional silencing by miRNAs, kinase inhibitors and 
blocking peptides, and concluded that post-transcrip -
tional regulators and blocking peptides provide better 
functional outcomes than other methods [233]. How -
ever, it remains to be determined whether this also 
applies to chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as 
AD. Besides, structure-based virtual screening and 
high-throughput screening are continuously conducted 
to identify new molecular entities with potent inhibi -
tory effect and high selectivity for DAPK1. Neverthe -
less, most of the compounds are only evaluated for the 
 IC50 values and binding affinities using in vitro assays. 
Whether the candidate compounds show direct target 
engagement in animal models remains to be studied.
Although several DAPK1 inhibitors have been evalu -
ated in animal models and show promising neuropro -
tective effects on ischemic stroke and epilepsy [234], 
the pharmacological profiles of these candidates are 
yet to be systematically evaluated. Besides, whether the 
lead compounds are effective in improving neuropatho -
logical changes and behavioral performance in chronic 
disease models such as AD and PD remains uncharac -
terized. Moreover, none of the aforementioned DAPK1 
modulators have  been tested in clinical trials to date 
[201]. Based on the lessons from clinical research on 
other kinase inhibitors, we propose several key points 
in the development of DAPK1 modulators for disease-
modifying treatment of AD. First, DAPK1  is an impor -
tant tumor suppressor gene that is downregulated in a 
wide range of cancers [235]. Non-selective inhibition 
of DAPK1 in tissues without DAPK1 dysregulation 
may cause unwanted side effects, which highlights the 
necessity of designing brain-specific DAPK1 inhibi -
tors for disease intervention. Second, the BBB may 
limit the penetration of chemicals into the brain paren -
chyma, thus reducing the effective concentration of 
the compound in the brain. Therefore, increasing the 
BBB permeability to  of compounds is an important 
aspect in compound screening and structural optimi -
zation. Third, the currently available DAPK1 inhibi -
tors mostly bind to the ATP pocket of DAPK1 in the 
kinase domain, which is highly homologous among 
DAPK family proteins. It would be helpful to design 
molecules with additional interacting patterns, such as 
the substrate recognition motif to obtain more selec -
tive and specific inhibitors. This could also avoid the 
undesirable inhibition of other types of protein kinases 
in the cell. In all, given that the neuropathologies in 
AD generally require long-term interventions, DAPK1 
modulators with balanced efficacy, safety property and 
favorable pharmacological profiles should be developed 
for further preclinical and clinical studies.
Conclusions
AD is an ageing-related progressive neurodegenera -
tive disorder. The  Ca2+/CaM-dependent Ser/Thr kinase 
DAPK1 has been implicated in neuronal loss in ischemic 
stroke, TBI and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. 
Several lines of evidence demonstrate that DAPK1 is a 
promising therapeutic target for the disease-modifying 
treatment of AD. First, DAPK1 is highly expressed in 
adult hippocampus, a brain region that is particularly 
vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathologies during AD pro -
gression. Our research has also established a causal link 
between DAPK1 dysregulation and core AD neuro -
pathologies, supporting DAPK1 as a common upstream 
regulator of Aβ generation and tau hyperphosphoryla -
tion in AD. Second, in addition to Aβ and tau patholo -
gies, DAPK1 has been suggested to affect neuronal cell 
death and synaptic function in the brain, two events that 
are directly connected with the structural and functional 
integrity of the brain. The multifunctional role of DAPK1 
is closely associated with different neuropathological 
changes in AD, making it possible to achieve compre -
hensive treatment by targeting one protein. Third, there 
are already synthetic and natural product-derived com -
pounds available for further identification and evaluation 
of DAPK1 inhibitors. Moreover, some compounds have 
been assessed in vivo and shown promising effects in AD 
mouse models, which could offer additional insights into 
the design and optimization of molecules with improved 
efficacy and safety profiles. Additionally, to better under -
stand the exact contribution of DAPK1 dysregulation to 
the pathophysiological changes of AD, several key issues 
need to be solved. For example, how do the expression 
and activity of DAPK1 change along the disease progres -
sion of AD? Can we develop DAPK1 as an early diagnos -
tic marker for the clinical assessment of AD progression? 
Does DAPK1 interact with other AD risk factors such as 
ApoE and TREM2 in the pathogenesis of AD and how? 
What is the pathophysiological role of DAPK1 in glial 
cells and how is this associated with AD pathologies? We 
believe that answering these questions is as important as 
the development of specific DAPK1 modulators for dis -
ease intervention, and will definitely deepen our knowl -
edge about the physiological and pathological roles of 
DAPK1 in the brain.

","This article reviews research on death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) and its role in various diseases, particularly focusing on neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. It discusses DAPK1's involvement in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation, and highlights its significance in retinal degenerative diseases, stroke, and cancer. The review also covers recent developments in identifying small-molecule inhibitors of DAPK1 through virtual screening and experimental studies. Additionally, it explores the therapeutic potential of peptides for treating central nervous system disorders. The article mentions several natural products and their interactions with DAPK1, as well as clinical trials involving drugs like tideglusib. Overall, the review underscores the importance of targeting protein kinases in developing treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly and represents a major clinical challenge in the ageing society. Neuropathological hallmarks of AD include neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, senile plaques derived from the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, brain atrophy induced by neuronal loss, and synaptic dysfunctions. Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system. Dysregulation of DAPK1 has been shown to contribute to various neurological diseases including AD, ischemic stroke and Parkinson’s disease (PD). We have established an upstream effect of DAPK1 on Aβ and tau pathologies and neuronal apoptosis through kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation, supporting a causal role of DAPK1 in the pathophysiology of AD. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about how DAPK1 is involved in various AD pathological changes including tau hyperphosphorylation, Aβ deposition, neuronal cell death and synaptic degeneration. The underlying molecular mechanisms of DAPK1 dysregulation in AD are discussed. We also review the recent progress regarding the development of novel DAPK1 modulators and their potential applications in AD intervention. These findings substantiate DAPK1 as a novel therapeutic target for the development of multifunctional disease-modifying treatments for AD and other neurological disorders.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disorder. According to the newest statistics, more than 55 million people worldwide are suffering from AD or related dementia, making AD and other dementias the leading cause of disabilities in the elderly [1]. As of 2019, the estimated healthcare cost among people with dementia was more than $590 billion, and this cost is projected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2050 [2]. AD is characterized pathologically by the formation of numerous intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of highly phosphorylated tau proteins and extracellular senile plaques composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. In addition to NFTs and amyloid plaques, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction are commonly observed during disease progression, and contribute to cell death, breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and impairment of neural circuits in the brain. In particular, neuronal loss is a prominent pathological feature in AD, and has been associated with both structural and functional changes in brain regions involved in learning and memory [3]. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a pivotal role in regulating the microtubule dynamics. The interaction between tau and microtubules is affected by the phosphorylation status of tau in neurons, which is controlled by a host of kinases and phosphatases [4, 5]. The pathological phosphorylation of tau in AD not only drives the dissociation of tau from microtubules, but also affects the localization and solubility of tau in neurons [6–8], thus leading to microtubule disruption and the formation of filamentous paired helical filaments in the AD brain [9–11]. The spatiotemporal accumulation of NFTs in the brain is significantly correlated with disease progression and the degree of cognitive impairment in AD patients [12–14], suggesting a central role of tau hyperphosphorylation in neurodegeneration. The aggregation of Aβ, a product from amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis, forms soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils in the brain. The accumulation of Aβ species in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain parenchyma is an early pathological feature of AD and has long been considered as an upstream trigger of various pathological changes in disease progression [15]. There are two distinct proteolytic pathways of APP, the non-amyloidogenic processing which involves sequential cleavage of APP by α- and γ-secretases, and the amyloidogenic processing which is mediated by β- and γ-secretases [16–20]. The main products of the amyloidogenic pathway are Aβ40 and Aβ42 [21–23]. The generation of Aβ is regulated by both the function of secretases and the expression of APP [24, 25]. For example, pathogenic mutations in APP and presenilin-1 (PS1) in familial AD strongly promote Aβ production and increase the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio [26–30]. Besides, post-translational modifications of APP such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and sumoylation also have a direct impact on Aβ generation [31–33]. DAPK1, a serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase, was initially identified from an antisense cDNA expression library of HeLa cells as a potential mediator of interferon-γ-induced cell death [34]. In subsequent studies, DAPK1 was shown to play a critical role in stimulus-triggered apoptosis, autophagy, and anoikis-like cell death. The pro-apoptotic function of DAPK1 is closely associated with the pathogenesis of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [35]. In particular, genetic variations in DAPK1 have been shown to be associated with late-onset AD (LOAD) in different populations [36–38]. Furthermore, the high abundance of DAPK1 in the cortex and hippocampus also highlights a central role of DAPK1 in regulating neuronal functions [39]. In this review, we discuss the role of DAPK1 and its implications in the pathophysiology of brain diseases, with a particular focus on AD. We also discuss strategies and translational potential for attenuating AD-related neuropathologies through pharmacological or genetic targeting of DAPK1.","The DAPK family consists of five kinase members: DAPK1, DAPK1-related protein 1 (DRP-1 or DAPK2), zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK or DAPK3), DAPK1-related apoptosis-inducing protein kinase 1 (DRAK1), and DRAK2 (Fig. 1a). Among these family members, DAPK2 and DAPK3 are highly homologous to DAPK1 in the catalytic domains, showing 80% and 83% identity at the amino acid level, respectively [40]. However, the kinase domains of human DRAK1 and DRAK2 share only 48% and 51% sequence homology with the catalytic domain of DAPK1 [41]. The extra-catalytic domains of DAPK family members vary greatly in size and structure, indicating distinct regulatory mechanisms, subcellular localizations and biological functions of these kinases. For instance, DAPK1 and DAPK2 are mainly found in the cytoplasm, and DAPK3 can be detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [42], while both DRAK1 and DRAK2 are exclusively localized to the cell nucleus [43]. In addition to the subcellular distribution, the DAPK family members also show different tissue expression profiles in the human body. For example, the expression of DAPK1 and DAPK3 has low tissue specificity, while DAPK2 is abundantly expressed in the bone marrow [44]. DAPK1 is a multidomain protein with distinct functional motifs involved in the modulation of catalytic activity, substrate binding, protein stability and localization of DAPK1. As shown in Fig. 1a, DAPK1 is composed of a kinase domain (13–267 aa), a Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-binding domain (275–334 aa), an ankyrin repeats domain (378–638 aa), two putative P-loops, a Ras of complex (ROC) domain (667–995 aa), a C-terminal of ROC (COR) domain (995–1288 aa), a death domain (DD, 1300–1398 aa) and a C-terminal serine-rich tail [35]. To date, there is no 3D structure of full-length DAPK1 available in the protein data bank, while the structure of the kinase domain of DAPK1 is well-resolved. The catalytic domain of DAPK1 is composed of 11 subdomains, including a β-sheet-rich N-lobe and an α-helix-rich C-lobe connected by a short hinge region (Fig. 1b). The conserved lysine (K42) in this domain is vital for the kinase activity as it is inside the ATP-binding loop. The catalytic activity of DAPK1 is abolished by substituting the lysine residue with an alanine residue (K42A) [45]. The basic loop region (45–56 aa) containing mostly positively charged residues in the kinase domain is a characteristic motif of the DAPK family as it is responsible for the homo- and hetero-dimerization of DAPK, which is critical for the modulation of kinase activity [46]. In addition to a direct regulation of catalytic activity, the kinase domain also affects the protein stability of DAPK1 by interacting with the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) through the amino terminal lobe (αC-β4 loop) [47, 48]. It has been suggested that the enriched neutral and positively charged residues in this subdomain are responsible for the interaction between DAPK1 and HSP90 [48], which further contributes to the maturation and stabilization of cellular DAPK1. The catalytic activity of DAPK1 is also regulated by the Ca2+/CaM–autoregulatory domain, which serves as a pseudo-substrate and occupies the catalytic cleft in the absence of CaM, thereby preventing the activation of DAPK1. In addition, the enzymatic activity of DAPK1 is regulated through phosphorylation at several sites that are located within the Ca2+/CaM-autoregulatory domain. For example, the autophosphorylation of Ser308 of DAPK1 has an inhibitory effect on its kinase activity [49]. Full activation of DAPK1 requires both dephosphorylation of Ser308 and binding of the Ca2+-activated CaM to the autoregulatory domain [50]. The interaction with CaM can release the catalytic cleft of DAPK1, and the dephosphorylation of Ser308 increases the affinity for CaM, thereby promoting the catalytic activity of DAPK1 even at low CaM levels [50]. The ankyrin repeats domain, made up of eight linearly aligned motifs with 33 amino acid residues, is a protein–protein interaction domain facilitating communication with other proteins. This domain is involved in the interaction between DAPK1 and actin filaments, which is pivotal for the correct cellular localization of DAPK1 [51]. Additionally, several ubiquitin ligases such as DAPK-interacting protein 1 (DIP-1) and carboxyl terminal of HSP70-interacting protein have been reported to interact with DAPK1 via the ankyrin repeats domain, thus regulating the proteasomal degradation of DAPK1 in cells [52, 53]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the phosphorylation of Tyr491/492 residues in the fourth ankyrin repeat by Src kinase inhibits the catalytic activity of DAPK1 [54]. The ROC and COR domains of DAPK1 regulate the kinase activity of DAPK1 by functioning as a GTPase. DAPK1 binds to GTP via the P-loop motif in the ROC domain and hydrolyzes GTP, resulting in conformational changes in the kinase and a reduction in inhibitory Ser308 phosphorylation [55, 56]. Apart from the intrinsic GTPase activity, the ROC-COR domain is able to interact with the phospho-Ser/Thr-directed peptidyl prolyl isomerase 1 (Pin1) via the cytoskeleton-binding region, leading to suppression of the activity of Pin1 that is critical for regulating the function of various phosphoproteins by isomerizing the phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro motif [57, 58]. The death domain of DAPK1 also actively regulates the kinase activity and the degradation of DAPK1, and participates in protein–protein interactions important for cellular apoptosis and energy metabolism. For instance, the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) binds to the death domain and phosphorylates the Ser735 residue of DAPK1, which enhances the kinase activity of DAPK1 in vitro and in vivo [59]. DAPK1 is able to interact with Kelch-like family member 20 and tuberous sclerosis 2 protein via the death domain, resulting in the proteasome- and lysosome-mediated degradation of DAPK1, respectively [60, 61]. Interestingly, DAPK1 has been reported to interact with and activate the pyruvate kinase isoform M2 in cancer cells in a kinase activity-independent manner. This interaction alters cellular metabolism by increasing the glycolytic rate and the generation of lactate in cells [62]. The serine-rich tail in the C-terminus acts as a negative regulator of DAPK1 activity as the deletion of this domain augments the pro-apoptotic function of DAPK1 [63]. In addition to the K42A mutant which shows diminished kinase activity, several other DAPK1 mutants have also been developed for research purposes. The ΔCaM, a mutant lacking the Ca2+/CaM-binding domain, and the phosphoablative S308A mutant, in which serine 308 is replaced by an alanine residue, are examples of constitutively active forms of DAPK1 with elevated catalytic activity [64]. The ΔCyto, a mutant lacking the cytoskeleton-binding region, shows altered colocalization with actin filaments and thus affects the cellular function of DAPK1 [64]. Protein kinases play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases [65, 66]. The activities of a variety of neuronal enzymes, receptors, and ion channels are regulated by their phosphorylation status [67, 68]. The spatiotemporal expression of DAPK1 in the brain indicates an essential role of this kinase in the regulation of neuronal functions. Further genetic analyses and animal studies have established that DAPK1 is indeed involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we focus on the role of DAPK1 in AD based on the research from our group and others, in order to present a comprehensive picture of how DAPK1 contributes to the pathophysiology of AD as well as the therapeutics targeting DAPK1. Although DAPK1 is ubiquitously present in different tissues and cell types, it is most abundantly expressed in the brain and lung tissues according to a Northern blotting analysis in rats [39]. In particular, the spatiotemporal expression of DAPK1 in the brain appears to be associated with neurodevelopment and neurogenesis. The temporal analysis of DAPK1 mRNA expression in rat brains revealed that the expression of DAPK1 mRNA is detectable at embryonic day 13 (E13) and further increases to a peak at approximately E20. However, the DAPK1 mRNA level gradually declines after birth [39]. The spatial determination of DAPK1 expression by in situ hybridization shows that DAPK1 mRNA can be extensively found in both proliferative and postmitotic regions within the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum during embryonic development and the neonatal stage [39]. These regions undergo widespread programmed cell death in embryonic neurogenesis [69, 70]. At postnatal and adult stages, the cerebral cortex and cerebellum both manifest a significant decline in DAPK1 mRNA expression, while DAPK1 expression in the hippocampus is maintained at high levels particularly in CA1, CA2 and the dentate gyrus [39, 71]. Besides, neuronal cells have higher DAPK1 expression than glial cells in the brain under physiological conditions. Thus, the widespread expression of DAPK1 during brain development and confined expression in mature neuronal populations in adults suggest that DAPK1 may not only participate in developmental neuronal death, but also play a role in regulating neuronal activity and synaptic functions. Indeed, it has been reported that DAPK1 is substantially enriched in hippocampal synapses and has complex interactions with numerous synaptic proteins [72, 73], which underlies the pathological influence of DAPK1 dysregulation on brain functions in neurological disorders such as AD. As a stress-responsive protein kinase, the dysregulation of DAPK1 expression or its activity has been implicated in a variety of neurological disorders. In Table 1, we briefly summarize how DAPK1 is dysregulated in common neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke, PD, AD, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). For instance, cerebral ischemia not only leads to DAPK1 activation, but also induces aberrant interactions between DAPK1 and other proteins such as p53 and GluN2B, thereby leading to neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction [73, 74]. The activation of DAPK1 in ischemia is likely mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-induced Ca2+ influx and the subsequent dephosphorylation at Ser308 of DAPK1 by the calcineurin phosphatase [75]. Another common disease with Ca2+ signaling disorder is epilepsy. Interestingly, our research demonstrated that DAPK1 dysregulation in epilepsy is model-dependent, as convulsive dosing of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) immediately activates the DAPK1 function in the mouse brain without upregulating its expression, while chronic exposure to PTZ at a low dose in the kindling model increased both the protein level and the activity of DAPK1 in the mouse brain [76]. Further, our study showed that kainic acid (KA) promotes DAPK1 activity by upregulating the ERK-mediated Ser735 phosphorylation in a mouse epilepsy model [77]. The dysregulation of DAPK1 is also noted in neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as AD, PD and TBI. For example, our previous research reported that the DAPK1 protein level but not its mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of AD patients [78, 79]. Likewise, it has been shown that the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model displays a marked increase in DAPK1 protein level in the striatal neurons without showing alterations of mRNA expression. The specific DAPK1 alteration pattern in AD and PD might be caused by the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms such as microRNA (miRNA)-mediated translational control of the target protein. Several miRNAs targeting DAPK1 have been found to be dysregulated in AD or PD [80–82]. These findings highlight a detrimental role of DAPK1 dysregulation in the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The relationship between DAPK1 and AD will be elaborated in the following sections to clarify the genetic associations, functional changes and underlying mechanisms. Genetic variation is thought to play a major role in the etiology of LOAD, which accounts for about 95% of all AD cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with the risk and the age of onset of AD. A number of genetic loci contributing to the susceptibility to AD have been identified [83–87]. Among them, the ε4 allele of ApoE has been confirmed as the strongest genetic risk factor for AD in various populations [88, 89]. The risk of AD is increased by about 3 folds and 15 folds in individuals carrying one or two copies of ApoE4 gene, respectively. The presence of ApoE4 allele is also associated with a younger age of onset of AD symptoms [90]. Several genetic variants (e.g., the unc-13 homolog B gene) in chromosome 9 have been suggested to be connected with the risk of LOAD in whole-genome sequencing and parametric linkage analyses [91]. SNP analysis of DAPK1, which is also localized on chromosome 9, has identified two variants, rs4878104 and rs4877365, that are potentially connected with LOAD in several sample cohorts [36]. This discovery has sparked research on DAPK1 SNPs and AD susceptibility in different populations, yielding controversial results regarding whether DAPK1 SNPs are correlated with the risk of LOAD. Li et al. first reported that rs4878104 and rs4877365 of DAPK1 influence the transcription of DAPK1 in an allele-specific manner, although both SNPs are inside the DAPK1 introns [36]. In particular, rs4878104 is located within a previously identified LOAD linkage peak and is repeatedly validated for its association with LOAD in six independent sample sets [36]. This finding was further corroborated by a genetic study in the Northern Han Chinese population, which showed that the genotype and the frequency of the rs4878104 but not the rs4877365 variant are significantly different between LOAD patients and age-matched controls [38]. Conversely, Minster et al. revealed that none of the DAPK1 SNPs are associated with LOAD in their cohort [92]. Similar results were also reported by several GWAS analyses in French, Polish and Italian populations [37, 93, 94]. The inconsistent findings then led to systematic meta-analysis aiming at elucidating the association between DAPK1 variants and AD, which discovered that the rs4878104 variant is not significantly associated with AD risk in the pooled population. Nevertheless, the subgroup analysis demonstrated that the rs4878104 variant is linked with AD risk in both American and Chinese populations but not in the European population [95]. Genotyping of rs4878104 revealed a discrepancy in the association between allele frequency and AD risk between Chinese and Caucasian populations, showing that the minor T allele is protective in Caucasians while the minor C allele is beneficial in Chinese population [36, 38]. In addition to the GWAS analysis, several biomarker-based studies have been performed to explore the association between DAPK1 and AD pathologies. For instance, Kauwe et al. reported that the minor allele of rs4878104 is associated with increased total CSF Aβ level [96]. However, by comparing brain samples from AD patients and healthy controls, Hainsworth et al. revealed that the expression of DAPK1 in the frontal cortex is not significantly different between AD and control cases. Moreover, the abundance of DAPK1 in the brain is also not correlated with Aβ level [97]. Thus far, there is still a lack of consistent molecular evidence to affirm the genetic association between DAPK1 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to AD, likely due to the complex etiology of AD attributed to gene-environmental interactions [98]. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out large-scale genetic analysis under the latest Alzheimer’s diagnostic framework by applying genetic epidemiologic methods such as Mendelian randomization, to better clarify the exact association between DAPK1 and AD phenotypes. The genetic link between DAPK1 variants and AD has triggered further investigations on whether DAPK1 is dysregulated in the brains of AD patients or mouse models. In the adult brain, DAPK1 expression is relatively abundant in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex [39, 71], two brain regions that are significantly affected during AD progression. Hainsworth et al. first compared the protein level of DAPK1 in the frontal cerebral cortex between AD patients and age-matched controls. The overall abundance of DAPK1 evaluated by immunoblot and immunostaining analyses was not significantly different between AD and control samples, although the AD cases displayed a trend of increase in the immunoblot analysis [97]. To further determine whether hippocampal DAPK1 expression differs between AD and control brains, we analyzed hippocampal tissues from AD patients and age-matched controls, and discovered that the DAPK1 protein level was markedly increased by about 2.5 folds in the hippocampus of AD patients compared with that in normal subjects [78, 79]. However, there was no significant difference in DAPK1 mRNA expression between AD and control samples [79]. Notably, the upregulation of DAPK1 appears to correlate with tau hyperphosphorylation in our sample cohorts [79]. Since tau pathology occurs early in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus during AD progression and may lead to irreversible synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss [115], we hypothesize that the hippocampal DAPK1 dysregulation may also be an early pathological event in the disease course of AD. In line with this, a recent study discovered that the AD patients have significantly elevated plasma DAPK1 content compared with age-matched controls. In addition, this increase is negatively correlated with the cognitive ability [111]. Thus, the DAPK1 protein can be potentially developed as a clinical biomarker to monitor disease progression. In AD mouse models, whether DAPK1 expression or function is dysregulated remains controversial in literature. Hainsworth et al. determined DAPK1 expression in brains of aged Tg2576 transgenic mice overexpressing the APP Swedish mutant and found that the DAPK1 protein level was comparable between AD mice and wild-type (WT) controls [97]. However, the expression of DAPK1 was significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of PS1 V97L transgenic mice compared with control mice at 6 and 9 months of age, which correlated with the appearance of Aβ accumulation and cognitive impairment [111]. Similarly, Duan et al. reported an elevation of DAPK1 expression in the hippocampus and cortex of 10-month-old human tau transgenic (hTau) mouse model, which paralleled the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau at Ser262 [113]. Nevertheless, none of the studies evaluated whether the enzymatic activity of DAPK1 is dysregulated in the brains of AD mouse models. Besides, whether DAPK1 is dysregulated in other AD mouse models of Aβ (e.g., APP/PS1 or 5xFAD) or tau (e.g., PS19 or tau P301L) pathologies remains to be characterized. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the expression of DAPK1 is elevated in the cortex overlying the corpus callosum in a mouse model of vascular dementia, which then drives abnormal accumulation of misfolded tau proteins in neurons and endothelial cells [116]. Brain ageing is tightly associated with the accumulation of cellular senescence in response to various stress signals, which may lead to structural and functional impairments in the central nervous system [117]. Guo et al. reported that the activity of DAPK1 is gradually increased whilst the protein level remains constant during the aging process in mouse hippocampus [118]. The age-dependent DAPK1 activation contributes to cognitive dysfunction in aged mice [118]. These findings indeed suggest that DAPK1 dysregulation plays a role in various cognitive disorders. Nevertheless, systematic analysis of DAPK1 expression and activity in the brains of AD mouse models is required to fully dissect the spatiotemporal association between DAPK1 and AD neuropathologies. The protein level of DAPK1 is tightly controlled by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Some transcriptional factors such as p53 and the cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) have been shown to affect DAPK1 transcription; however, their involvement in AD remains uncharacterized. Current evidence shows that the DAPK1 level is post-transcriptionally regulated in AD. In the following, we thus mainly focus on the post-transcriptional modulation of DAPK1 expression in AD. Hyperactivation of p53 is an important molecular feature in several neurodegenerative diseases [119]. The p53 protein can bind to the first intron of DAPK1 and efficiently reinforce the expression of DAPK1 in the presence of pro-apoptotic stimuli [120]. p53 upregulation in AD is mainly found in glial cells rather than in neurons [121]. Nevertheless, intracellular Aβ species also directly activate p53 expression by binding to its promoter [122]. Therefore, intracellular Aβ accumulation might upregulate DAPK1 expression through p53-mediated pathways. CREB1 is a well-known transcription factor in neurons. CREB1 is enriched on the promoter of DAPK1 and directly suppresses its transcription in the hippocampus. Reduced neuronal CREB expression may result in elevated DAPK1 expression and subsequent cell death, as has been reported in a rat brain injury model induced by cardiac arrest [123]. The CREB signaling is impaired in the brains of AD patients, as manifested by a significant decline in both total and activated CREB levels in AD subjects compared with those in normal controls [124]. Thus, the CREB-mediated transcriptional control of DAPK1 might be an alternative pathway that modulates DAPK1 expression in AD. Contrary to these findings, our previous studies established that the upregulation of DAPK1 expression in AD is not caused by transcriptional changes [78, 79]. These results suggest that the expression of DAPK1 in AD is likely regulated through both transcriptional processes and post-transcriptional pathways that are similar to those of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and CDK5 [125, 126]. Circadian dysregulation is tightly associated with the progression of AD [127]. Melatonin is a master regulator of human circadian rhythm and confers numerous beneficial effects on neuronal function [128]. The brain level of melatonin is lower in AD patients than in normal controls [129]. Since melatonin is capable of preventing tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ accumulation in AD mouse models, its downregulation may increase the vulnerability to AD [130, 131]. We recently uncovered an inverse correlation between brain melatonin level and DAPK1 expression in AD patients [129]. Furthermore, melatonin directly binds to the ankyrin repeats of DAPK1, leading to the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of DAPK1 in cells (Fig. 2a) [129]. Our study also proved that the melatonin-induced DAPK1 downregulation does not rely on melatonin receptors or DAPK1 gene transcription [129]. Indeed, the post-translational regulation of DAPK1 level in the cell is primarily controlled by the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways [132]. Several binding partners of DAPK1, including HSP90 and DIP-1, have been shown to regulate the stability of DAPK1 protein [47]. Molecular chaperones are key components for the maintenance of proteostasis in the cell by monitoring the proper folding, maturation and degradation of proteins [133]. With accumulation of intracellular Aβ species, molecular chaperones such as HSP90 may function to antagonize the cellular stress caused by the excessive misfolded proteins [134]. We recently observed that the primary neurons incubated with Aβ aggregates have a higher DAPK1 protein level than those without Aβ treatment [135]. However, the DAPK1 mRNA level is not altered by Aβ, which is in line with our previous findings in brain samples from AD patients [79]. The increased DAPK1 protein level by Aβ treatment is attributed to the HSP90-mediated stabilization of DAPK1 protein in neurons, as inhibition of HSP90 abolishes the Aβ-induced DAPK1 elevation (Fig. 2b) [135]. In addition to the protein stability regulation, DAPK1 expression may also be affected by various miRNAs. Our group has identified two miRNAs, miR-143-3p and miR-191-5p, as important upstream regulators of DAPK1 expression in AD. Levels of both miRNAs are significantly reduced in brains of AD patients, and are negatively correlated with DAPK1 protein level [80, 81]. Moreover, miR-143-3p and miR-191-5p bind to the 3′ UTR of DAPK1 mRNA. Instead of inducing mRNA degradation, they block the translation of cellular DAPK1 (Fig. 2c) [80, 81]. Several other miRNAs have been reported to regulate DAPK1 expression in the brain. For instance, DAPK1 is a target gene of miR-130a-3p. The downregulation of miR-130a-3p induced by Aβ treatment promotes DAPK1 expression, resulting in accelerated neuronal cell death and cognitive impairment [136]. MiR-124 binds to the 3′ UTR of DAPK1 mRNA and affects the translation of DAPK1 in ischemic stroke models [137]. In PD, a loss of miR-26a leads to an elevation of DAPK1 protein level in dopaminergic neurons [82, 138]. Interestingly, it has been reported that the level of miR-26a is significantly decreased in AD patients and mouse models [139, 140], and is closely associated with the cognitive ability in AD patients [139]. Therefore, it is expected that miR-26a dysregulation may also contribute to the DAPK1 upregulation in AD. The abnormal phosphorylation and accumulation of tau in the brain is closely associated with the disease course of AD, and has been used as a clinical biomarker for disease diagnosis [141]. Tau has about 85 putative phosphorylation sites, and around 50 sites, mostly located in the basic C-terminal half of the protein, have been identified in brain tissue [141, 142]. Phosphorylation modulates the surface charge of tau and its conformation, thus altering the inter- and intra-molecular interactions important for the physiological functions of tau in neurons [143]. In pathological conditions known as tauopathies, neuronal tau proteins are hyperphosphorylated at multiple sites, leading to the detachment of tau from microtubules and subsequent misfolding and aggregation, which ultimately drives microtubule disassembly and the formation of pathogenic tau aggregates [7]. It has been noted that the aberrant tau phosphorylation in AD is not only characterized by a 3- to 4-fold increase in overall phosphorylation level, but also by the presence of various novel modified sites not seen in healthy brains [144]. DAPK1 has been found to be upregulated in brains of hTau transgenic mouse models. By overexpressing or knocking down DAPK1 in HEK 293 cells stably expressing tau proteins, Duan et al. found that DAPK1 increases tau phosphorylation at Thr231, Ser262 and Ser396 sites [113]. Interestingly, DAPK1 has no effect on common tau phosphorylating kinases such as GSK-3β, CDK5, CaMKII and Cdc2 or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). However, DAPK1 overexpression elevates the activity of microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) through direct binding between the death domain of DAPK1 and the spacer region of MARK2 [113, 145]. MARK2 is known to interact with and phosphorylate tau at Ser262 residue [146]. MARK2 knockdown has no impact on DAPK1-induced tau hyperphosphorylation [113], but the MARK2-induced tau phosphorylation and microtubule destabilization are potentiated by DAPK1 in neurons as DAPK1 overexpression enhances MARK2 activity in tauopathy [145]. Interestingly, DAPK1 is able to interact with the tau protein through its kinase domain, further leading to tau phosphorylation at Ser262 [100], promoting dendritic spine damage and neuronal death in ischemic stroke mice [100]. Our group further identified a novel mechanism by which DAPK1 increases neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation in AD. We discovered that DAPK1 aggravates neuronal tau phosphorylation at Thr231, Ser262 and Ser396 by inhibiting the Pin1-mediated cis–trans isomerization of the pThr231-Pro motif, which is required to maintain normal tau functions and turnover (Fig. 3) [79, 147, 148]. This unique mechanism was further validated by the observation that DAPK1 enhances the protein stability of S262A (Ser to Ala) tau mutant, while having no effect on the T231A (Thr to Ala) mutant [79]. The DAPK1-induced tau hyperphosphorylation promotes the formation of sarkosyl-insoluble tau species (mature pathogenic NFTs), disintegrates microtubule structures and prevents neurite outgrowth [79]. Besides, the accumulation of cis-pThr231-tau caused by DAPK1 upregulation robustly triggers axonal damage and neuroinflammation in TBI mouse model [104]. Our recent study also demonstrated that toxic Aβ species facilitate tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation in neurons by upregulating DAPK1 expression [135]. Inhibition of DAPK1 activity with synthetic small molecules antagonizes pathological tau phosphorylation and accumulation caused by TBI or Aβ species [104, 135]. As a pro-apoptotic kinase, the upregulation of DAPK1 is believed to stimulate cell apoptosis under stress stimuli. However, it has been shown that tau hyperphosphorylation following DAPK1 activation exerts anti-apoptotic effects in N2a cells by blocking the generation of cleaved caspase-3 [113]. Previous research has reported that tau accumulation and hyperphosphorylation protect cells from apoptosis via reducing the p53 level and preserving mitochondrial functions [149]. DAPK1 can bind to p53 via the death domain and phosphorylate the Ser23 residue of p53, further triggering the p53-dependent transcription of apoptotic genes and mitochondrial damage in ischemic stroke [101, 150]. The Aβ species-induced DAPK1 upregulation in primary neurons leads to both tau hyperphosphorylation and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis [135]. Thus, it remains debatable as to whether DAPK1-induced tau phosphorylation confers anti-apoptotic effects in neurons. In addition to AD and TBI, it has been reported that chronic stress exposure in mice concomitantly elevates the expression of DAPK1 and abnormal tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus, which can be reversed by exercise training and antidepressant treatment [110]. These results together suggest that DAPK1 dysregulation indeed causes tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation, and promotes neuronal damage by disrupting the microtubule dynamics in AD and other neurological disorders. The accumulation and aggregation of Aβ in the brain parenchyma is an early pathological change in AD, occurring decades prior to the development of clinical symptoms [151]. The generation of Aβ by the amyloidogenic processing of APP is affected by the post-translational modification of APP in neurons [152]. Notably, the phosphorylation of APP in the intracellular domain modulates multiple steps of the proteolytic cleavage process and has a profound influence on the production of Aβ [33]. Eight phosphorylation sites have been identified in the cytoplasmic domain of APP thus far, and seven of them have been discovered in the brains of AD patients [33]. The Thr668 residue of APP (APP695 numbering) can be phosphorylated by a variety of kinases related to cell proliferation and stress responses [153]. Moreover, Thr668 phosphorylation has been proven to be highly upregulated in the brains of AD patients compared with age-matched controls. The phosphorylation of Thr668 facilitates the translocation of APP to endosomes, thus promoting the colocalization of APP with the β-secretase BACE1 [32]. As a consequence, the generation of Aβ is dramatically increased in neurons due to the enhanced amyloidogenic processing. Recently, we showed that DAPK1 interacts with APP through its death domain and increases the JNK3-mediated APP phosphorylation at Thr668, thereby shifting APP processing toward the amyloidogenic pathway (Fig. 4) [78]. DAPK1 strongly promotes the secretion of both Aβ40 and Aβ42, and ablation of DAPK1 significantly diminishes the production of Aβ in Tg2576 mouse model [78]. Besides, we observed a positive correlation between DAPK1 protein levels and APP phosphorylation at Thr668 in Alzheimer’s patient brains, further supporting the role of DAPK1 in regulating the amyloid pathology in AD [78]. We additionally revealed that pharmacological inhibition of DAPK1 activity by a selective DAPK1 inhibitor ((4Z)-4-(3-pyridylmethylene)-2-styryl-oxazol-5-one) significantly downregulates the amyloidogenic processing of APP and Aβ generation in different cell models, suggesting that DAPK1 is a promising target for early intervention of Aβ pathology in AD. Similar to the pThr231-Pro motif of tau, the pThr668-Pro motif of APP is also a substrate of Pin1-mediated cis–trans isomerization. The phosphorylation of Thr668 is essential for the binding between Pin1 and APP at the plasma membrane [154]. Pastorino et al. found that Pin1 potently catalyzes the conversion of the cis pThr668-Pro APP conformers to the trans conformation which is preferentially favored by the non-amyloidogenic processing in neurons [154]. Since DAPK1 is known to phosphorylate Ser71 of Pin1 and inhibits the prolyl isomerase activity [57], we speculate that the DAPK1-induced APP phosphorylation and the cis pThr668-Pro APP accumulation caused by DAPK1-induced Pin1 suppression both contribute to the excessive generation of Aβ in AD. In addition to affecting APP processing and Aβ generation, DAPK1 dysregulation is also involved in mediating Aβ neurotoxicity in the brain. The self-assembly of Aβ into soluble oligomers has been recognized as a main culprit for Aβ-related neuropathological changes [155]. Low-molecular-weight Aβ species activate DAPK1 by inducing the dephosphorylation of Ser308 and trigger caspase-3-dependent neuronal cell death [156]. We recently demonstrated that both low- and high-molecular-weight Aβ species upregulate DAPK1 protein levels in neurons and cause extensive neuronal apoptosis [135]. Additionally, the upregulation of DAPK1 by Aβ oligomers leads to Ca2+ overload and excitotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cell line via phosphorylation of the Ser1303 residue of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit, resembling the effect observed in an ischemic stroke mouse model [73, 111]. Neuroinflammation is another prominent pathological change in AD, characterized by the presence of gliosis and abundant pro-inflammatory cytokines in cortex and hippocampus. Song et al. found that the Aβ species stimulate DAPK1 activity in BV2 microglial cell line via activating the lysosomal cathepsin B [157], thereby promoting the generation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and subsequent cognitive impairments in vitro and in vivo [157]. Neuronal cell death is commonly observed during neural development and pathological conditions [158]. The programmed cell death in the developmental period contributes to the elimination of redundant neurons, which is crucial for the establishment of functional neural circuits and the maintenance of normal organ size [158]. The developmental cell death occurs in a spatiotemporally restricted and well-controlled manner to regulate the functional and structural homeostasis in the brain [159]. However, abnormal cell death in specific neuronal populations is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, and is closely associated with functional and structural impairments during disease progression [3]. For example, cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain are a primary cluster of neurons forming neural connections with the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala [160]. They regulate a wide range of physiological functions such as learning and memory, attention and emotion [161]. In pathological conditions such as AD, cholinergic neurons undergo irreversible degeneration and cell death, ultimately leading to brain atrophy and cognitive decline [162]. The specific spatial and temporal expression of DAPK1 in the brain implicates a potential role of DAPK1 in regulating neuronal cell apoptosis during neural development [39, 163], yet systematic research is needed to fully reveal the exact role of DAPK1 in early brain development. Surprisingly, we and others noticed that whole-body DAPK1 knockout (KO) in mouse has minimal influence on the overall lifespan and brain morphology [164]. Besides, DAPK1 KO or kinase activity deficiency in mice does not cause behavioral deficits [104, 165]. These findings indicate that the physiological role of DAPK1 in neural development might be compensated by other mechanisms in KO mouse models, but this needs further evidence. The dysregulation of DAPK1 in neuronal cell death was first demonstrated in ischemic stroke. Activated DAPK1 phosphorylates the Ser1303 residue of GluN2B at extrasynaptic sites, leading to enhanced NMDAR channel conductance and subsequent Ca2+ influx in neurons (Fig. 5a) [73]. Blocking DAPK1 rescues the Ca2+ overload-induced ischemic neuronal death and brain damage [73]. The excitotoxicity of GluN2B phosphorylation elicited by DAPK1 activation is also involved in neuronal loss caused by epilepsy, toxic Aβ treatment, stress-related depression and TBI insult [76, 77, 105, 109]. An earlier study demonstrated that DAPK1 binds to and phosphorylates p53 at the Ser23 residue. Upon the Ser23 phosphorylation, p53 translocates to the nucleus to initiate pro-apoptotic gene transcription. In addition, phosphorylated p53 also interacts with cyclophilin D in mitochondria and evokes mitochondrion-dependent necrosis (Fig. 5b) [101]. Previous studies have shown that DAPK1 can trigger both cell apoptosis and autophagic cell death [166]. A notable feature of DAPK1-induced cell death is cellular morphological changes such as membrane blebbing and cell protrusion, which are attributed to the phosphorylation of myosin-II light chain at Ser19 by DAPK1 and the subsequent alterations in cytoskeletal structure [166, 167]. We also identified N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) as a novel DAPK1 substrate in regulating neuronal cell death [168]. DAPK1 interacts with NDRG2 via its cytoskeleton-binding region, and directly phosphorylates the Ser350 of NDRG2 [168]. DAPK1-induced NDRG2 phosphorylation mediates the neuronal cell apoptosis triggered by Aβ species or ceramide through activating the caspase-3 pathway (Fig. 5c) [168]. Furthermore, NDRG2 phosphorylation at Ser350 is significantly elevated in the Tg2576 mouse model and in hippocampal tissues of AD patients. DAPK1 KO successfully reverses hippocampal neuronal loss in 8-month-old Tg2576 mice [168]. These findings support a causal role of DAPK1 dysregulation in AD-related neuronal cell death. Dysregulation of sphingomyelin has been suggested to be associated with the progression of cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy in AD [169]. Ceramide is a metabolite from enzymatic cleavage of sphingomyelin in neurons and regulates a broad range of cellular events including senescence, survival, and apoptosis [170]. Brain regions with degenerative phenotypes show elevated ceramide content. The accumulation of ceramide has been shown to activate DAPK1 by inducing PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of the Ser308 residue, thereby causing hippocampal neuronal death [171, 172]. In addition to sphingomyelin dyshomeostasis, the missense mutation (T835M) of the netrin receptor uncoordinated-5 homologue C (UNC5C) contributes to the risk of LOAD by increasing the vulnerability of neurons to cell death without affecting Aβ pathologies [173]. Hashimoto et al. demonstrated that the T835M-UNC5C interacts with DAPK1 via the respective death domain and induces pronounced cell death by activating the JNK/NADPH oxidase/caspase pathway [174]. Pharmacological inhibition of DAPK1 activity attenuates the T835M-UNC5C-induced cell death, suggesting that the interaction between UNC5C and DAPK1 may upregulate the catalytic activity of DAPK1 [174]. Indeed, it has been revealed that the Unc-5 homolog 2, a member of the UNC5 family, interacts with DAPK1 and recruits a subunit of PP2A to dephosphorylate the Ser308 residue of DAPK1, leading to DAPK1 activation and extensive cell death [175, 176]. Thus, these results all corroborate the fundamental role of DAPK1 in modulating neuronal cell death in the pathogenesis of AD. Synapses are the structural unit for neuronal communications and form the functional basis for neural circuits that are vital for brain function. The progressive degeneration of synapses in the brain is highly correlated with cognitive decline in AD [177], and is an emerging therapeutic target for disease-modifying treatment of AD. The high abundance of DAPK1 in adult hippocampal tissues and in particular its enrichment in dendritic spines indicate that DAPK1 may possess important physiological functions in regulating synaptic structure and plasticity [73, 164]. This has been confirmed by our recent quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of hippocampal tissues from WT and DAPK1 KO mice [178]. Glutamate receptors are one of the major modulators of the synaptic Ca2+ influx in neurons [179]. NMDARs dynamically change their subcellular localization, trafficking and expression levels in reaction to neuronal activities, and are believed to be critical for long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) [180]. Importantly, the DAPK1-induced Ser1303 phosphorylation of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit, which was originally reported to be detrimental in ischemic stroke, has essential physiological functions in modulating LTP and LTD (Fig. 6a) [181]. It has been revealed that DAPK1 and CaMKII differentially bind to GluN2B in LTD and LTP, respectively. LTP stimuli induce high levels of cellular Ca2+/CaM that can disrupt the binding between DAPK1 and GluN2B while facilitating the interaction between CaMKII and GluN2B. Besides, DAPK1 is dispersed from dendritic spines during LTP due to the transient depolymerization of F-actin [72, 181]. However, LTD stimuli trigger the calcineurin-mediated DAPK1 activation by dephosphorylating the Ser308 residue. This then causes an increase in the DAPK1–GluN2B interaction and subsequent phosphorylation of the Ser1303 residue, which retains DAPK1 in dendritic spines but prevents the access of CaMKII to GluN2B [72, 181]. It should be mentioned that the transient activation of DAPK1 is required for LTD induction under physiological conditions, which differs from the sustained upregulation of DAPK1 in ischemic stroke or AD [181]. Excessive DAPK1 in the synapse may prohibit the synaptic accumulation of CaMKII and result in LTP deficits in the brain. Aβ aggregates induce prolonged upregulation of DAPK1 in primary neurons [135], which may further mediate the NMDAR overactivation-induced Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and excitotoxicity in AD brains. Shu et al. demonstrated that DAPK1 is selectively activated in excitatory pyramidal neurons of the entorhinal cortical layer II region (ECIIPN) prior to the appearance of Aβ deposition [112]. The activation of DAPK1 in this brain region is strongly involved in synaptic dysfunction manifested by significantly reduced presynaptic terminals and dendritic spines, and disordered excitatory and inhibitory balance in CA1 region [112]. Inhibition of DAPK1 activity in ECIIPN potently improves the synaptic transmission and cognitive performance of AD mice [112]. Therefore, DAPK1 may contribute to synaptic degeneration during AD progression irrespective of the presence of Aβ species through different molecular mechanisms. DAPK1 has also been shown to interact with several presynaptic proteins including Caytaxin, Syntaxin-1A and α-synuclein (α-syn) [71, 108, 182]. For example, the upregulation of DAPK1 during brain ageing is associated with a downregulation of presynaptic Caytaxin levels, which is likely mediated by the DAPK1-induced caspase-3 activation [118]. A loss of Caytaxin expression significantly impairs the frequency and the amplitude of neuronal miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and weakens hippocampal LTP in vivo (Fig. 6b) [118]. Interestingly, the interaction between DAPK1 and Caytaxin also reciprocally inhibits the presynaptic DAPK1 activity and protects neurons against the ischemic stroke-induced apoptosis [182], representing an early protective mechanism by which neurons antagonize ischemic brain injuries. Syntaxin-1A is a basic component in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. It participates in the synaptic vesicle docking and fusion process by cooperating with other proteins in the SNARE complex [183, 184]. Tian et al. found that DAPK1 associates with the C-terminal half of Syntaxin-1A in the plasma membrane, and phosphorylates its Ser188 residue in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The phosphorylated Syntaxin 1A has reduced binding affinity to Munc18, while the assembly of the SNARE complex is not affected [71]. α-Syn is another binding partner of synaptic vesicles in neurons and is closely associated with the pathogenesis of PD. DAPK1 phosphorylates α-syn at the Ser129 residue, promoting the self-aggregation of α-syn into toxic species both in vitro and in vivo [82, 108]. However, it is not clear how the DAPK1-induced α-syn alteration modulates synaptic functions. Goodell et al. revealed that DAPK1 KO mice have comparable LTP strength to that of WT mice, while the LTD level is enhanced at a young age [164]. Functional studies demonstrated that DAPK1 KO mice have different presynaptic components in hippocampus compared with the WT mice, as evidenced by the increased paired-pulse ratio and reduced glutamate release probability in the hippocampus of KO mice [164]. Our transcriptomic analysis in DAPK1 KO and WT mice suggested that DAPK1 ablation globally changes the transcriptional profile in multiple brain regions and significantly regulates genes related to glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic pathways [185]. The potential involvement of DAPK1 in modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity hints that DAPK1 dysregulation in AD may additionally cause synaptic impairments. However, in vivo studies using both DAPK1 KO and transgenic AD mouse models are needed to fully address how DAPK1 is involved in synaptic deficits during AD progression. The progression of AD is also accompanied by gliosis, chronic neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and autophagy deficiency [186]. The sustained activation of glial cells in the brain not only leads to an imbalance in pro- and anti-inflammatory signals, but also impairs the clearance of debris and protein aggregates, and disrupts synaptic integrity [187, 188]. Therefore, the management of gliosis represents a promising approach to counteracting neuroinflammatory response in AD [189]. Previous research indicated that DAPK1 expression is rather low or undetectable in glial cells at the embryonic stage [39]. However, the expression pattern of DAPK1 in glial cells in the adult brain or in response to external stimuli remains uncharacterized. Song et al. found that DAPK1 is expressed in the BV2 murine microglial cell line. The activity of DAPK1 but not its protein level can be upregulated by Aβ treatment in lipopolysaccharide-primed BV2 cells [157]. The activation of DAPK1 promotes the production of IL-1β and the initiation of caspase 1-mediated activation of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, further leading to memory deficits in mouse models [157]. The Aβ treatment-induced activation of DAPK1 may be attributed to the elevation of cytosolic cathepsin B, which is able to interact with DAPK1 and slow down the turnover of endogenous DAPK1 [157, 190]. Pharmacological inhibition of DAPK1 activity attenuates the Aβ-induced NLRP3 activation and cognitive impairment in vivo. These findings implicate that modulating DAPK1 function in microglia might have protective effects on AD-related chronic neuroinflammation. In addition to regulating the inflammatory response, microglia are also actively involved in maintaining brain homeostasis by executing phagocytosis of redundant synapses, damaged cells, myelin debris and protein aggregates [191]. It has been demonstrated that the autophagy-lysosomal system, an essential cellular machinery for the phagocytosis process, is impaired in the microglia of AD mouse models [192–194]. DAPK1 is an upstream regulator of cellular autophagy that directly interacts with proteins involved in the autophagy machinery. For instance, DAPK1 phosphorylates the Thr119 of Beclin1, and thus facilitates the release of Beclin1 from Bcl-X L to initiate the autophagy process [195, 196]. Besides, it has been reported that DAPK1 forms a stable complex with MAP1B in cells subjected to starvation. MAP1B is indispensable for DAPK1-induced autophagosome accumulation and membrane blebbing [197, 198]. Oikonomou et al. discovered a novel role of DAPK1 in affecting the LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP, also known as noncanonical autophagy) in fungal infection-related inflammation by modulating the formation of autophagosomes [199]. Interestingly, the LAP is an essential part of microglial phagocytosis in the brain. Chen et al. demonstrated that DAPK1 is also involved in the regulation of LAP in the microglia using an in vitro subarachnoid hemorrhage model by exposing microglial cells to oxyhemoglobin [200]. Oxyhemoglobin suppresses microglial LAP by upregulating p38 and downregulating DAPK1, further resulting in a reduction of cellular Beclin1 expression [200]. These data concomitantly support a crucial role of DAPK1 in cellular autophagy. Nevertheless, whether DAPK1 dysregulation is associated with autophagy impairment in AD is yet unresolved. Only one study reported that Aβ treatment activates neuronal DAPK1 and triggers autophagosome formation and apoptosis sequentially in primary neurons [156]. Importantly, neurons with high amounts of autophagosomes are devoid of apoptotic phenotypes [156], which suggests that the DAPK1-inducced autophagy might confer protection in AD. Taken together, the function of DAPK1 in microglia appears to be contradictory, as DAPK1 activation may stimulate inflammatory response, but it may also enhance autophagy to maintain cellular homeostasis. Given the multiple roles of DAPK1 dysregulation in the pathogenesis of AD, DAPK1 has been an emerging target for the development of novel disease-modifying therapies for AD. Several types of molecule, including synthetic compounds, natural product-derived chemicals and peptide-based modulators have been tested in mouse models to evaluate the therapeutic potential of DAPK1 inhibition in various neuropathologies [201]. The first small-molecule DAPK1 inhibitor was identified by screening a library of compounds, leading to the discovery of an aminopyridazine with a weak DAPK1 inhibitory effect [202]. Further structural optimization of the lead compounds resulted in the generation of two 3-amino-6-phenylpyridazine derivatives with remarkably improved inhibition and selectivity for DAPK1 (IC50 = ~ 15 μM) [202]. These compounds have a common 6-phenyl group and competitively bind to the ATP-binding pocket of DAPK1. An in vivo study using a hypoxic ischemia rat model demonstrated that a single intraperitoneal injection of the candidate compound successfully ameliorated brain weight loss and preserved microtubule-associated proteins in the brain [202]. Okamoto et al. performed a structure-based virtual screening using the structures of target protein kinases, and identified a series of compounds with a common scaffold of 2-phenyl-4-(3-pyridinylmethylene)-5(4H)-oxazolone [203]. The pyridinyl group, the oxazolone ring and the phenyl ring in the scaffold are all essential for the inhibition of DAPK1 and DAPK3 activities based on the structure–activity relationship analysis [203]. More importantly, compounds with this scaffold are highly selective for DAPKs, facilitating the discovery of molecules with improved affinity. To discover novel DAPK1 inhibitors, Okamoto et al. carried out a multiple-step virtual screening, in which they first generated several binding-site models using molecular dynamics simulation to select structures with the highest enrichment, and then large-scale screening was performed based on the enriched DAPK1 structure [204]. Following the discovery of the lead compound, in vitro kinase assays and similarity search of more potent compounds were performed to obtain the optimal chemicals. This led to the discovery of 4-(pyridin-3-ylmethylene)oxazol-5(4H)-one (C6) [204], a highly efficient inhibitor for DAPK1 and DAPK3 (IC50 = 69 and 225 nM, respectively). This compound has been widely used in animal studies due to its strong inhibitory effect and high specificity for DAPK1. For example, we have shown that C6 is capable of reducing the secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the low nanomolar range [78]. Besides, C6 effectively prevents the ceramide- and Aβ aggregate-induced neuronal cell death [168]. In an epileptic mouse model, C6 treatment protected against the PTZ-induced seizures by diminishing the DAPK1-induced GluN2B phosphorylation [76]. Feng et al. designed a group of octahedral pyridocarbazole metal complexes based on the structure of the pan-kinase inhibitor Staurosporine [205]. The specific inhibitor OS4 contains ruthenium in the 1,4,7-trithiacycloalkane scaffold. Crystallographic analysis revealed extensive interactions between OS4 and the catalytic domain of DAPK1, including hydrogen bonds between the maleimide moiety and the hinge region of DAPK1, hydrophobic interactions between the 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane ligand group and the ATP-binding site and glycine-rich loop of DAPK1, and the occupation of the pyridocarbazole heterocycle in the adenine pocket of DAPK1 [205]. The IC50 values of OS4 for DAPK1 and DAPK3 are 2 and 8.8 nM, respectively. In addition, it preferentially inhibited DAPK1 activity with a selective factor higher than 4.4 in the kinase screening assay [205]. Carlson et al. applied a fluorescence-linked enzyme chemoproteomic strategy and found that HS38, a selective pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidinone, can potently suppress DAPK1 and DAPK3 with an IC50 of about 200 nM [206]. The inhibition of DAPK3 by HS38 leads to reduced contractile force in mouse aorta and calyculin A-stimulated arterial muscle via decreasing the phosphorylation of regulatory myosin light chain (RLC20) [206]. Nevertheless, it is not clear how this compound regulates DAPK1 activity in ischemic stroke or other neurological disease models. Singh et al. conducted virtual screening and molecular simulations to identify compounds that can simultaneously occupy the ATP-binding site and the substrate recognition site of DAPK1, which led to the discovery of the compound 11 as a promising inhibitor that directly interacts with the Glu100 and Glu143 residues of DAPK1 [207]. Furthermore, the prediction of drug-likeness also showed higher druggability and safety profile of the compound 11 than other compounds [207]. To target neuronal tauopathy, Farag et al. designed a dual inhibitor for DAPK1 and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) with a 3,5-dimethoxy-N-(4-(4-methoxyphenoxy)-2-((6-morpholinopyridin-3-yl)amino)pyrimidin-5-yl)benzamide structure [208]. This compound suppresses DAPK1 activity in a non-ATP competitive manner, as it binds to the substrate-binding site rather than the ATP-binding pocket of DAPK1. The IC50 value slightly decreased from 2.89 to 0.92 μM with the increase of ATP concentration in the in vitro kinase assay [208]. In addition, it also strongly inhibits the activity of CSF1R by competing with ATP. In vitro evaluation proved that the compound efficiently suppresses tau aggregation and lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation [208]. This compound is also highly selective toward DAPK1, despite the sequence homology between DAPK1 and other DAPK family members [208]. Moreover, this molecule might show encouraging neuroprotective effects due to its high BBB permeability and brain bioavailability [208]. Recently, rational design and synthesis of aryl carboxamide derivatives have led to the generation of an isonicotinamide derivative 4q as a promising DAPK1 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 1.09 μM [209]. The compound has been tested for anti-cancer activity in leukemia and breast cancer, while its effects on neuropathologies remain to be investigated [209]. Similarly, some 6,8,9-poly-substituted purine derivatives have been able to prevent leukemia cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by suppressing DAPK1 activity. Further structure optimization led to the discovery of 6-benzyloxy-9-tert-butyl-8-phenyl-9H-purine (compound 6d), an efficient DAPK1 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 2.5 μM [210]. Wilbek et al. performed high-throughput screening of novel DAPK1 inhibitors by applying a microfluidic capillary electrophoresis assay based on the DAPK1-induced specific phosphorylation of the Ser1303 residue of DAPK1 [211]. The identified compound (CPR005231) binds to the ATP pocket of DAPK1 at nanomolar concentrations and has an IC50 of 247 nM for DAPK1 [211]. However, this compound also inhibits the protein-tyrosine kinase Src at a similar IC50 [211]. Firoz et al. performed an in silico study aimed at obtaining DAPK1 inhibitors for the treatment of retinal degeneration, as studies suggested that DAPK1 contributes to ophthalmic disorders in large part by regulating the programmed cell death. They found several caspase inhibitor analogs with good inhibitory effects and promising drug-likeness properties [212]. In conclusion, a number of in silico studies have been performed to discover specific DAPK1 inhibitors, and indeed compounds with different scaffolds have been identified and tested in in vitro kinase assays. Although many studies usually include drug-likeness prediction which could provide some hints for further in vivo evaluation, animal experiments are urgently needed to better determine the effectiveness, pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of these small-molecule DAPK1 inhibitors. Natural compounds represent an important resource for the discovery of therapeutic chemicals for various neurological diseases. Flavonoids are widely distributed bioactive molecules in nature and possess diverse biological effects such as anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammation by interacting with key signaling molecules in the cell [213]. Yokoyama et al. first measured the binding affinity of 17 natural flavonoids to DAPK1 using the 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) competitive assay. Of all the tested flavonoids, morin, a natural polyphenol abundantly found in Moraceae species, showed the highest binding affinity toward the DAPK1 catalytic domain (IC50 = 1.6 ± 0.27 μM) in the ANS assay [214]. Crystallographic analysis revealed that these flavonoids mainly bind to the ATP pocket of DAPK1. In particular, it has been found that the 2’–OH of morin forms strong ionic interaction with the K42 residue of DAPK1, which underlies the robust inhibitory effect of morin on DAPK1 activity. Resveratrol is a polyphenol ubiquitously found in grapes. It is a well-known dietary supplement due to its cardiovascular protective activity. Resveratrol directly binds to the ATP pocket of DAPK1 with an apparent dissociation constant of 8.5 μM [215, 216]. Specifically, the phenyl ring (A-ring) of resveratrol anchors at the adenyl base of ATP and the 3-OH group forms hydrogen bonds with the hinge region of DAPK1 [215]. Based on the binding mode, Yokoyama et al. further characterized several resveratrol derivatives using conventional biophysical approaches. Thermodynamic analysis of the binding suggested that the interaction between resveratrol derivatives and DAPK1 is mainly driven by favorable enthalpy changes due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions [216]. These derivatives all dock to the ATP pocket of DAPK1, and additional hydrogen bonds can be formed in the hinge region of DAPK1 [216]. A similar binding mode was reported for Purpurin, an anthraquinone isolated from the roots of Rubia cordifolia, for its interaction with DAPK1 [217]. The IC50 value of Purpurin for DAPK1 was determined to be 890 nM [217]. Talwar et al. carried out virtual screening in combination with in vitro kinase assay to discover DAPK1 inhibitors from the ZINC database [218]. The compound-N4 binds to the ATP pocket and the substrate recognition site of DAPK1 [218]. Quercetin is a ubiquitously distributed BBB-permeable flavonoid. Qi et al. identified DAPK1 as a downstream target of Quercetin using a systematic approach [219]. Very interestingly, they observed that HT-22 cells treated with Aβ species showed an increase in DAPK1 mRNA expression which is consistent with their microarray analysis of the GSE5281 dataset, and Quercetin treatment dramatically suppressed this increase [219]. This finding indicates that Quercetin is likely beneficial for ischemic stroke and AD by indirectly targeting DAPK1. In all, although biophysical and crystallographic data support the idea that these natural compounds directly bind to DAPK1, it remains elusive whether these molecules indeed exert protective effects through inhibiting DAPK1 in vitro and in vivo. There are also natural compounds that can upregulate DAPK1 function in cells. For instance, Sanggenon C is able to decrease the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mind-bomb 1 (Mib1, also known as DIP-1), an important binding partner controlling the degradation of DAPK1 in the cell [52, 53]. Sanggenon C upregulates the cellular DAPK1 level by stabilizing the protein, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in glioblastoma model [220]. Grifolin has been reported to upregulate the cellular p53 function and promote the transcription and expression of DAPK1 in breast cancer cell lines, thus promoting cancer cell death [221]. Curcumin has also been shown to cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells by upregulating DAPK1 transcription and its protein level [222]. Notably, these data are mostly obtained using cancer cell lines and it is not clear whether these molecules also show similar effects in neuronal cells. Many of the biological functions of DAPK1 are mediated by its cellular substrates. Specific amino acids or sequences involved in the recognition and binding events can therefore be utilized to design peptide-based blockers to interfere with DAPK1 dysregulation-induced pathological changes. This method has several advantages over small-molecule inhibitors. First, peptide-based blockers are highly selective and specific toward the protein targets and their substrates. Second, peptide-based blockers can be easily modified to increase the inhibition potency and biological diversity [223]. Third, the metabolism of peptides generates amino acids with low cellular toxicities [224]. Nevertheless, peptides are susceptible to rapid proteolysis and insufficient membrane penetration in vivo, which hinder their translational applications in neurological diseases [225]. In this part, we will discuss the use of blocking peptides as a tool to specifically disrupt DAPK1–substrate interactions for disease intervention. The blocking peptide approach was initially employed by Tu et al. to block the interaction between DAPK1 and GluN2B in an ischemic stroke mouse model [73]. In their study, the direct binding sequence of GluN2B (1292–1304 aa) was fused to the cell-membrane transduction domain of the HIV-1 Tat protein (Tat-NR2BCT) [73]. This peptide completely abolished the interaction between DAPK1 and GluN2B in neurons, thereby resulting in reduced GluN2B phosphorylation and subsequent Ca2+ influx in mouse brain [73]. Furthermore, the Tat-NR2B CT treatment was sufficient to improve ischemic stroke-induced brain infarction and chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in vivo [73, 109]. The same group also identified a minimal binding sequence in the DNA-binding motif of p53 that is responsible for the interaction with the death domain of DAPK1. The fragment was conjugated with the cell-membrane transduction domain of Tat protein to generate a blocking peptide Tat-p53DM, which has been shown to suppress DAPK1-induced p53 phosphorylation in cortical neurons subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation [101]. Moreover, intravenous injection of the peptide not only rescued brain infarction and neuronal cell death, but also reversed motor deficits in ischemic stroke mouse model [150]. The interaction between DAPK1 and tau can also be prevented by using a membrane-permeable peptide containing the minimal tau-binding sequence [100]. The peptide can cross the BBB when administered intravenously. It is capable of ameliorating stroke-induced dendritic spine damage and cognitive injuries by attenuating the DAPK1-induced tau phosphorylation in neurons [100]. Inspired by this, our group also developed a specific blocking peptide (Tat-DM) for the interaction between ERK and DAPK1. This peptide interrupts ERK-induced DAPK1 phosphorylation at Ser735 by uncoupling the binding between these two proteins, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of DAPK1 [77]. Treatment of Tat-DM successfully reduced neuronal apoptosis and suppressed seizure severity in KA-induced mouse epilepsy model in vivo by downregulating DAPK1 activity in the brain [77]. These data together demonstrate the promising application of peptide-based DAPK1 modulators in the intervention of neurological diseases. They are not only robust tools for research purposes, but also possess translational potential for clinical applications. However, peptides usually suffer from low biostability and poor BBB permeability in vivo, which strongly limit the bioavailability and efficacy of peptide-based therapeutics in human brains [226]. Strategies such as peptidomimetics, chemical modifications and bionanotechnology-based delivery systems might be applied to overcome these drawbacks [223]. Protein kinases are valuable therapeutic targets for the intervention of AD, not only due to the direct participation of dysregulated kinases in various AD pathologies, but also because of the vast number of chemicals and strategies available for drug development [227]. Compounds targeting GSK-3β, CDK5, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK3 or several tyrosine kinases have been evaluated in AD mouse models, and some of them have reached clinical trials [228]. For instance, short-term (10 weeks) treatment of lithium, a GSK-3β inhibitor, had no impact on CSF biomarkers and cognitive performance in AD patients. However, a prolonged treatment of lithium (over 12 months) in patients with mild cognitive impairment led to improved cognitive function and reduced tau phosphorylation with favorable safety profiles [229, 230]. Tideglusib, another GSK-3β inhibitor that has been evaluated in a 26-week, multicenter phase II clinical trial, also demonstrated positive effects on cognitive performance in patients with mild AD [231]. Other kinase inhibitors such as Neflamapimod for p38 MAPK and NE3107 for ERK1/2 are being analyzed in AD patients and have shown promising results in phase II clinical trials [227]. However, CDK5 or JNK3 inhibitors are less investigated in clinical trials although these kinases play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD. CDK5 and JNK3 are crucial for cellular signaling transduction, meaning that non-selective suppression of the activities of the kinases may induce toxic rather than therapeutic effects in AD patients [232]. The extensive involvement of DAPK1 in regulating multiple AD pathological changes makes it an ideal target for the development of disease-modifying treatments for AD. Indeed, several synthetic DAPK1 inhibitors and blocking peptides have already been exploited in AD or stroke mouse models for disease intervention. The neuroprotective effect of DAPK1 inhibition on ischemic stroke has been systematically summarized by Khan et al. [233]. In their study, they compared the effects of different approaches in inhibiting neuronal DAPK1 function, including gene knockout, post-transcriptional silencing by miRNAs, kinase inhibitors and blocking peptides, and concluded that post-transcriptional regulators and blocking peptides provide better functional outcomes than other methods [233]. However, it remains to be determined whether this also applies to chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Besides, structure-based virtual screening and high-throughput screening are continuously conducted to identify new molecular entities with potent inhibitory effect and high selectivity for DAPK1. Nevertheless, most of the compounds are only evaluated for the IC50 values and binding affinities using in vitro assays. Whether the candidate compounds show direct target engagement in animal models remains to be studied. Although several DAPK1 inhibitors have been evaluated in animal models and show promising neuroprotective effects on ischemic stroke and epilepsy [234], the pharmacological profiles of these candidates are yet to be systematically evaluated. Besides, whether the lead compounds are effective in improving neuropathological changes and behavioral performance in chronic disease models such as AD and PD remains uncharacterized. Moreover, none of the aforementioned DAPK1 modulators have been tested in clinical trials to date [201]. Based on the lessons from clinical research on other kinase inhibitors, we propose several key points in the development of DAPK1 modulators for disease-modifying treatment of AD. First, DAPK1 is an important tumor suppressor gene that is downregulated in a wide range of cancers [235]. Non-selective inhibition of DAPK1 in tissues without DAPK1 dysregulation may cause unwanted side effects, which highlights the necessity of designing brain-specific DAPK1 inhibitors for disease intervention. Second, the BBB may limit the penetration of chemicals into the brain parenchyma, thus reducing the effective concentration of the compound in the brain. Therefore, increasing the BBB permeability to of compounds is an important aspect in compound screening and structural optimization. Third, the currently available DAPK1 inhibitors mostly bind to the ATP pocket of DAPK1 in the kinase domain, which is highly homologous among DAPK family proteins. It would be helpful to design molecules with additional interacting patterns, such as the substrate recognition motif to obtain more selective and specific inhibitors. This could also avoid the undesirable inhibition of other types of protein kinases in the cell. In all, given that the neuropathologies in AD generally require long-term interventions, DAPK1 modulators with balanced efficacy, safety property and favorable pharmacological profiles should be developed for further preclinical and clinical studies. AD is an ageing-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The Ca2+/CaM-dependent Ser/Thr kinase DAPK1 has been implicated in neuronal loss in ischemic stroke, TBI and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that DAPK1 is a promising therapeutic target for the disease-modifying treatment of AD. First, DAPK1 is highly expressed in adult hippocampus, a brain region that is particularly vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathologies during AD progression. Our research has also established a causal link between DAPK1 dysregulation and core AD neuropathologies, supporting DAPK1 as a common upstream regulator of Aβ generation and tau hyperphosphorylation in AD. Second, in addition to Aβ and tau pathologies, DAPK1 has been suggested to affect neuronal cell death and synaptic function in the brain, two events that are directly connected with the structural and functional integrity of the brain. The multifunctional role of DAPK1 is closely associated with different neuropathological changes in AD, making it possible to achieve comprehensive treatment by targeting one protein. Third, there are already synthetic and natural product-derived compounds available for further identification and evaluation of DAPK1 inhibitors. Moreover, some compounds have been assessed in vivo and shown promising effects in AD mouse models, which could offer additional insights into the design and optimization of molecules with improved efficacy and safety profiles. Additionally, to better understand the exact contribution of DAPK1 dysregulation to the pathophysiological changes of AD, several key issues need to be solved. For example, how do the expression and activity of DAPK1 change along the disease progression of AD? Can we develop DAPK1 as an early diagnostic marker for the clinical assessment of AD progression? Does DAPK1 interact with other AD risk factors such as ApoE and TREM2 in the pathogenesis of AD and how? What is the pathophysiological role of DAPK1 in glial cells and how is this associated with AD pathologies? We believe that answering these questions is as important as the development of specific DAPK1 modulators for disease intervention, and will definitely deepen our knowledge about the physiological and pathological roles of DAPK1 in the brain."

Abstract
Introduction: Females with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) suffer accelerated dementia
and loss of cholinergic neurons compared to males, but the underlying mechanisms
are unknown. Seeking causal contributors to both these phenomena, we pursued
changes in transfer RNS (tRNA) fragments (tRFs) targeting cholinergic transcripts
(CholinotRFs).
Methods: We analyzed small RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) brain region which is enriched in cholinergic neurons, compared to
hypothalamic or cortical tissues from AD brains; and explored small RNA expression in
neuronal cell lines undergoing cholinergic differentiation.
Results: NAc CholinotRFs of mitochondrial genome origin showed reduced levels
that correlated with elevations in their predicted cholinergic-associated mRNA tar-
gets. Single-cell RNA seq from AD temporal cortices showed altered sex-specific
levels of cholinergic transcripts in diverse cell types; inversely, human-originated neu-
roblastoma cells under cholinergic differentiation presented sex-specific CholinotRF
elevations.
Discussion: Our findings support CholinotRFs contributions to cholinergic regulation,
predicting their involvement in AD sex-specific cholinergic loss and dementia.

1 INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, glob-
ally affecting over 50 million people.1 Its clinical symptoms reflect
accelerating failure of regulatory, neurochemical, and neural networks,
initiating with the cholinergic system and leading to a progressive cog-
nitive deterioration. Neuropathologic features in subcortical nuclei2
precede neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) development within the mesial
temporal cortex.3 AD lesions involve accumulation of multimeric
amyloid-β fibrils forming neuritic plaques and NFTs consisting of
hyperphosphorylated tau and leading to loss of synapses, dendrites,
and, eventually, neurons.1 However, the mechanisms underlying AD-
related dementia, which develops relatively late in the disease course4
are a matter of controversy.5
Clustered cholinergic neurons in thesubstantia innominate/nucleus
basalis of Meynert6 are the most investigated site of acetylcholine
(Ach) producing interneurons within the nucleus accumbens (Nac).
They contribute to cognitive and motivational behavior and loss of
these neurons predicts progression from mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) to AD. This is faster in females even when considering their
longer life expectancy.7–9 Females score lower than males on tests
of cognitive domains,10 even after controlling for possible demo-
graphic and genetic factors, and show more pronounced mitochondrial
imbalances11 and loss of cholinergic neurons.12
The reduced cholinergic activity in basal cholinergic forebrain
neurons and their cortical projection sites supports the “cholinergic
hypothesis of AD,”13 which argues that dysfunction of Ach-producing
brain neurons contributes to the AD-related cognitive decline. Conse-
quently, the development of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) is one of
the few treatments for AD.14 C h E I sd on o tp r e v e n to rs l o wd i s e a s ep r o -
gression. They may independently lead to cognitive dysfunction and
delirium,15 are more effective in males and cause more pronounced
a d v e r s ee f f e c t si nf e m a l e sw i t hA D .7,16 Additionally, muscarinic ago-
nists have shown some clinical promise, and modulate various impair-
ments seen in AD, affecting both the cortical cholinergic basal forebrain
system and the 1%–2% of Nac Ach-producing neurons17 that project
to brain regions including cortical areas.18 Correspondingly, dysfunc-
tion of cholinergic pathways in both the basal forebrain and the Nac
contribute to cognitive decline in AD.19,20
Both whole tissue and single-cell AD studies revealed changes
in coding and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcript levels, but their
involvement in cholinergic cellular dysfunction remained unknown.
Those included microRNAs (miRs), small single-stranded ncRNAs
about 22 nucleotides long that target mRNA molecules and func-
tion as post-transcriptional regulators.21 Therefore, individual miR
levels are co-altered in the AD brain with their experimentally val-
idated targets.22 Furthermore, sex-specific miR profiles modulate
responses to tau pathology23 and sex- and age-related Ach signals24
in AD, yielding sex-specific biomarkers for multiple neurodegenerative
disorders.25 However, Nac AD miRs remain under-investigated.
Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived fragments (tRFs) are a recently redis-
covered small non-coding RNA regulators that were previously con-
sidered to be inactive products of tRNA degradation. The tRFs are
derived by specific tRNA cleavage of several different nucleases,
including Dicer, Drosha, and Angiogenin26 (Figure 1). All tRFs up to 30
nucleotides in length may function like miRs by modulating the expres-
sion of mRNA targets carrying complementary sequence motifs.26 In
nucleated blood cells, tRFs targeting cholinergic transcripts replace
miRs in regulating cholinergic reactions during ischemic stroke.27
Moreover, certain tRFs regulate ribosomal function, cancer, innate
immunity, stress responses, and neurological disorders.28 The tRFs
may originate from nuclear or mitochondrial genomes26 and mitochon-
drial disfunction is a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases,
including AD.8 While AD involves changes in miRs targeting mitochon-
drial genes,29 the role of mitochondrial-originated tRFs in cholinergic
neurons, as well as their sex-specific profiles and genetic origins in AD
have not yet been investigated.
Pursuing cholinergic-targeting tRFs and/or miRs (CholinotRFs,
CholinomiRs) that may affect AD pathology and its disease course and
cognitive decline, we sought changes in their predicted mRNA tar-
gets in AD and healthy non-cognitively impaired elderly control cases;
examined the specific cell populations that express these cholinergic
mRNA targets in single-cell RNA-Seq from the middle temporal gyrus
(MTG), and studied the role of CholinotRFs in cholinergic regulation in
cell lines of human origin.
2 METHODS
2.1 Cohorts
1. RADC Subjects: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data derived from
participants in the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC) ROS
and MAP cohorts.30 Both studies were approved by an Institutional
Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. All participants in
ROSMAP enroll without dementia and agree to annual clinical eval-
uation and brain donation at the time of death. All cases received a
neuropathological evaluation based upon Braak staging, Cerad, and
NIA-Reagan criteria as well as a semi-quantitative analysis of the
number of NFTs and neuritic plaque.Post mortembrain tissues were
collected from the noted brain regions of over 65 years old adults
without known dementia at enrollment, recruited for the ROS and
MAP projects; 196post mortemsamples were from the NAc (119
females, 77 males), 71 from the superior temporal gyrus (STG) (36

females, 35 males), and 181 from the hypothalamus (120 females,
61 males).
2. The condition of the participants was set separately for each trait;
cognitive state was set by the clinical diagnosis at time of death
(NCI: cogdx score of 1; MCI: 2; AD: 4), NFT state by the semiquan-
titative measure of severity of NFT pathology (NCI: Braak score of
0–2; MCI: 3–4; AD: 5–6) and the neuritic plaque state was set by the
semi-quantitative measure of neuritic plaques (NCI: CERAD score
of 1–2; AD: 3–4; in accordance with the recommendation for binary
division)31–33 (T ableS1).
3. Libraries constructed from total RNA were subjected to small RNA-
Seq (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA library prep set for Illumina,
New England Biolabs), and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq
500 platform. Presequencing Bioanalyzer 6000 Quality control
was performed using FastQC, and served for adapter trimming
and quality-based filtering of all raw reads, and to determine RNA
Integrity Number (RIN) tissue values. Samples with RIN<5w e r e
filtered out. Small RNA was aligned to miRBase using miRexpress
and to the tRNA transcriptome using the MINTmap. Long RNA was
aligned to the human reference transcriptome for the NAc and
hypothalamic samples, but not the STG (ENSEMBL GRCh38 release
79).
4. STG Long RNA-Sequencing: Long-RNA STG sequencing files were
obtained via controlled access to the AD Knowledge Portal (https://
www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2580853/files/). These data were
generated as part of the Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell
Atlas (SEA-AD) study frompost mortemSTG of 377 volunteers (242
females, 135 males) provided by Dr. Eric Schadt from Mount Sinai
School of Medicine, NY. Samples with RIN< 5 were filtered out,
leaving 211 samples (136 females, 75 males). Clinical Dementia Rat-
ing scale (CDR) was used to classify subjects as no cognitive deficits
(CDR =0) and AD (CDR=3–5), leaving 155 samples (98 females,
57 males).
5. Small conditional RNA (scRNA)-Seq data: Cellular level transcrip-
tomic data from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) of female and
male aged volunteers on the AD spectrum were downloaded from
the SEA-AD and was accessed in December 2022 fromhttps://
registry.opendata.aws/allen-sea-ad-atlas. Study data were gener-
ated frompost mortemb r a i nt i s s u eo b t a i n e df r o mt h eM T Go f8 4
aged individuals spanning the full spectrum of AD severity (preMCI,
MCI, mild-moderate severe AD) and five neurotypical aged adult
cognitively intact individuals.
2.2 Data preprocessing
Raw counts were normalized using the Deseq2’s median of ratios
method in which counts are divided by sample-specific size factors
determined by median ratio of gene counts relative to geometric mean
per gene.34 The median expression threshold for tRFs and miRs from
each brain region was calculated separately for females and males and
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
∙ Systematic Review: The authors reviewed PubMed and
Web of Science studies, including some that addressed
microRNAs (miRs) involvement in AD; however, their role
in the cholinergic-enriched nucleus accumbens (NAc) was
not studied and transfer RNA (tRNA) fragments (tRFs)
involvement in AD remained essentially uncovered.
∙ Interpretation: Significant disease and sex-specific differ-
ences in miRs and tRFs in the NAc associated with the
patients’ dementia. Concomitant changes in cholinergic-
regulating mRNA targets of these miRs/tRFs in this and
other brain regions support the cholinergic hypothesis of
AD and point to a possible causative role in the reported
sex-specific differences in AD. Single-cell RNA-seq anal-
yses indicated cholinergic involvement of diverse cell
types.
∙ Future Directions: The manuscript proposes a role for
mitochondrial-originated tRFs in the sex-specific differ-
ences observed in AD and in disease pathogenesis. How-
ever, the exact molecular mechanism(s) of function and the
specific targets of those tRFs call for further neuronal cell
culture and organoid models.
set as the number of significant features fixed in the maximal number
of analyses; 9 (T ableS2).
2.3 Statistical analysis
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to calculate thep-value of each
small RNA (miR/tRF) in each tissue and group independently using the
SciPy.stats.kstest python function (T ablesS3–S9). Benjamini-Hochberg
test for false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple com-
parisons (𝛼= 0.1) using the statsmodels.stats.multitest python library.
The binomial probability was calculated using SciPy.stats. binomtest
python function, with alternative= “greater.” Fisher’s Exactp-values
were calculated by SciPy.stats.Fisher_exact.
2.4 Target prediction
The predicted targets of the identified tRFs were determined using the
prediction algorithm of the MR-microT DIANA tool based on sequence
motif.35 The likelihood of binding the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and
protein coding sequences (CDS) of each targeted mRNA was calcu-
lated separately, combined to a prediction score that was normalized
by the conservation of the binding site in a number of species. T argets
with prediction score <0.8 were extracted. The predicted targets

algorithm35,36 to enable the best comparison between tRF and miR
targets. Predicted targets with a prediction score<0.8 were extracted.
The python libraries selenium and multiprocessing were used for
web scraping in order to automate the use of the DIANA prediction
tools.
2.5 Definition of cholinergic small non-coding
RNAs
Literature review enabled compilation of 58 cholinergic system related
genes divided into two main pathways37–50;A C h - p r o d u c t i o na n d
cholinergic regulation (T ableS10). The cholinergic threshold for small
non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) was set at the 80th quantile of the number
of ACh production or cholinergic regulation-associated targets in each
sample independently, for females and males combined (tRFs; 4, miRs;
5, for the NAc, STG, and hypothalamus), based on the work in Loben-
tanzer et al.43 sncRNAs passing the cholinergic threshold, or targeting
at least one “core” cholinergic gene (T ableS10, denoted as “Core”),
were defined as CholinotRFs/CholinomiRs.
2.6 Logistic regression for interaction analysis
The Logit model from statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model was used
for interaction analysis between two discrete variables; the potential
function of the tRF (CholinotRF vs. non-CholinotRF, denoted by 1 and
0, respectively) and the origin of the tRF (MT vs. non-MT, denoted by
1 and 0, respectively). The label of each tRF represented the direction
of change in AD state (Reduction vs. Elevation, denoted by 1 and 0,
respectively). The coefficients and their significance represented the
correlation of these variables to the change in AD state.
2.7 scRNA-Seq analysis
We analyzed the scRNA-Seq dataset from the Seattle Alzheimer’s Dis-
ease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD) study. Preprocessing and analysis of
snRNA-Seq data was implemented with the SCANPY package, on the
entire cohort, including 1,378,211 cells and 36,601 genes. Choliner-
gic genes with median expression smaller than 100 in the STG bulk
RNA-Seq data were excluded, leaving 31 cholinergic genes (T ableS10).
Linear regression was applied to STG bulk RNA-Seq data and the
linear combinations representing the expression of each gene as the
sum of the expression in each cell type population and the relative
number of each cell population from the entire cohort (the numbers of
the cells are listed in T ableS11). Seaborn.regplot was used for the lin-
ear regression plot and SciPy.stats.linregress was used for significance
calculation with alternative=“greater.” Expression values of the cells
were calculated according to the scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups method:
np.log2((np.expm1(AD mean) + 1e-9)/(np.expm1(Control mean) +
1e-9)). The log fold changes of each gene in each cell popula-
tion can be found in T ablesS12–S13, in which the significance of
the change was calculated using scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups with
method = “wilcoxon.” The correlation coefficients were calculated
using SciPy.stats.stats.pearsonr.
2.8 Cell culture
The cell lines LA-N-2 (female) (DSMZ Cat# ACC-671,
RRID:CVCL_1829) and LA-N-5 (male) (DSMZ Cat# ACC-673,
RRID:CVCL_0389) were purchased at DSMZ (Braunschweig,
Germany). These cells respond to differentiation by several
neurokines (CNTF, LIF, IL-6) by cholinergic differentiation accord-
i n gt oak n o w np r o t o c o l ,51 corresponding with an elevation of
choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the central cholinergic marker
(mRNA, protein, and activity) as well as it’s intronic vesicular
ACh-transporter gene, vAChT (aka SLC18A3). The small-RNA
sequencing files were produced in-house and are available to all
interested researchers from the GEO data portal (https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc = GSE132951, GEO accession:
GSE13295). Each time point (2 vs. 4 days) contained 4 replicates from
each state (control vs. differentiated) for each sex (female vs. male).
CholinotRFs were defined in the same way as they were defined
for the brain samples (cholinergic threshold: 3). SciPy.stats .ttest_ind
was used for the calculation of thet-test p-value for the presen-
tation of the tRF changes in cell lines. The results are reported in
T ablesS14–S17.

3 RESULTS
3.1 NAc CholinotRFs decline in AD females
To identify disease- and sex-specific changes in the NAc sncRNA pro-
files, we analyzed small RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of aged
donors with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. The cholinergic
hypothesis of AD states that dysfunction of ACh-producing brain neu-
rons contributes to the cognitive decline. Therefore, we classified the
donors according to their clinical diagnosis: controls with no cognitive
impairment (NCI) (65; 35 females, 30 males) and persons diagnosed
with AD (47; 28 females and 19 males) (Methods, T ableS1).31–33 To
find AD-associated changes in short tRFs, we applied a Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test on control and AD short RNA-Seq reads (Methods). We
found substantial differences in the levels of sncRNAs between males
and females. Specifically, in females, we identified 10 tRFs with altered
levels (FDR correctedp ≤ 0.152)( F i g u r eS1,T a b l eS3). In males, by
contrast, no significant alterations in tRFs were found (Figure2A).
AD involves the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and
neuritic plaques. However, their link to cognitive decline is unclear.4
Therefore, we asked to what extent changes in short tRFs and miRs
will manifest when AD is classified according to these neuropathologi-
cal features, rather than the level of cognitive decline (T ableS1). When
classifying the donors according to neuritic plaques we found no signif-
icant differences in the levels of sncRNAs (FigureS2A, Methods). When
classifying them according to NFTs, we identified only a single tRF
that significantly differed between the two groups (FigureS2B,T a b l e
S4, Methods). These results support the use of cognitive impairment
rather than neuropathology as a measure of disease severity.
Based on the cholinergic hypothesis, we hypothesized that the AD-
related changes in tRFs will be particularly pronounced in those tRFs
containing complementary sequences to cholinergic genes. To test
this hypothesis, we assembled a list of 58 genes associated with ACh
production and cholinergic regulation (T ableS10, denoted as “ACh
Production” or “Cholinergic Regulation,”37–50 based on our previous
work43), of which seven genes were denoted as “Core”38,43 genes
based on their key roles in the cholinergic pathway (T ableS10). For
each sncRNA, we used the microT prediction tool to find its choliner-
gic targets.35 This identified approximately a quarter of sncRNAs likely
to be involved in ACh production and cholinergic regulation (Methods).
Focusing on tRFs whose level was significantly altered in AD compared
to control state, 6 of the 10 tRFs altered in females were CholinotRFs,
while only 25% of all the tRFs (98/401) were identified as CholinotRFs
(p <0.02) (Methods).
The levels of all six significant NAc CholinotRFs were reduced in AD
females (p <0.02). We were therefore wondering whether this reduc-
tion is only the tip of an iceberg and reflects a more general reduction
in the level of CholinotRFs, including in those tRFs that did not cross
the significance level. Indeed, in females, the level of 74% (68/92) of
the remaining (no significant change) CholinotRFs was lower in the AD
than in the control state, while the level of only 26% (24/92) was higher
(p < 3 × 10−6). By contrast, no such reduction was observed in the
non-CholinotRFs (36%, 108/303 decreased; 64%, 195/303 increased).
A similar tendency, to lesser extent, was also observed in males: 70%
 15525279, 2023, 11, Downloaded from https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13095 by Cochrane Russian Federation, Wiley Online Library on [07/01/2026].

(68/97) of CholinotRFs decreased and 30% (31/97) of CholinotRFs
increased (p <5 ×10−5); 47% (135/288) of non-CholinotRFs decreased
and 53% (153/288) of non-CholinotRFs increased.
Caution should be exercised when interpreting this result, because
the classification of tRFs into CholinotRFs and non-CholinotRFs is cor-
related with their origin, mitochondrial (MT) or nuclear (non-MT). For
example, in females, 82% (80/97) of the CholinotRFs are also MT-
tRFs, whereas only 10% (29/303) of the non-CholinotRFs are also
MT-tRFs. We, therefore, used logistic regression to test whether the
potential function of a tRF (CholinotRF vs. non-CholinotRF) is corre-
lated with its reduction in AD, even when its origin (MT vs. non-MT)
is accounted for (Methods). The regression coefficients indicate that
both in females and in males, the potential function of a studied tRF
as cholinergic regulator is correlated with its reduction in the AD NAc
(females: regression coefficient 1.1,p < 1 × 10−4; males: regression
coefficient 1.1,p <9 ×10−4), whereas the regression coefficient for the
origin was not statistically significant (females: regression coefficient
0.006, p <0.98; males: regression coefficient−0.25, p <0.35), indicat-
ing that the effect in MT-tRFs derived from their potential function as
cholinergic regulators.
3.2 tRF decline is more pronounced in the NAc
than in other brain regions
It is important to note that only a small fraction of NAc neurons
is cholinergic, limiting the interpretation of the RNA-Seq data that
were derived from a heterogenous population of NAc neurons. To test
whether the change in tRFs reflects changes in the NAc cholinergic
neurons, we repeated the analysis in two additional brain regions, the
STG and hypothalamus. The STG is a cortical region that was previ-
ously linked to AD, presenting epigenetic modifications in persons with
AD according to their pathogenesis,53 whereas the hypothalamus is
a subcortical region that is relatively spared.54 We classified small-
RNA profiles extracted from the STG and hypothalamus of controls
(STG: 11 females, 11 males; hypothalamus: 15 females, 11 males) and
donors diagnosed with AD (STG: 10 females, 6 males; hypothalamus:
20 females, 10 males) (T ableS1). In the STG, we identified only 2 tRFs
whose levels are significantly changed in females between the con-
trol and AD groups. None of these tRFs was a CholinotRF (T ableS5).
In the hypothalamus, we did not find any tRFs that differed between
the two groups. In agreement with these results, the reduction in the
global level of CholinotRFs was modest, statistically significant only
for males in the STG and females in the hypothalamus (STG females:
57%, 55/97, p < 0.11, males: 62%, 65/104,p < 7 × 10−3; hypotha-
lamus females: 58%, 54/93,p < 0.07; males: 40%, 36/92,p < 0.99).
These findings lend support to the potential cholinergic relevance of
our NAc observations. While the dorsomedial portion of the hypotha-
lamus contains cholinergic neurons,54 our findings in the hypothalamus
part that is non-cholinergic were compatible with the link between the
altered tRFs in the NAc and their functional relevance to cholinergic
neurons.
3.3 AD-related changes in miR levels differ
substantially from AD-related changes in tRFs
Many studies have reported post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression by miRs.14,21,27 Therefore, if the changes in tRFs merely
reflect changes in the fraction of cholinergic neurons (as a result of cell
death) then a similar pattern of change in miRs is expected in AD. How-
ever, miRs exhibited very different behaviors from those of tRFs. While
substantial changes in the levels of tRFs were observed in the in NAc
of AD females, but not males, the opposite pattern was observed in
miRs. In males, we identified 13 miRs whose levels were significantly
altered between the AD and control groups (Figure2B,T a b l eS6), while
only a single miR was significantly altered in females (T ableS7). Intrigu-
ingly, the single significantly reduced miR in the NAc of AD females was
a CholinomiR (the well-studied AChE-targeting miR-132-3p24), while
5 of the 13 significantly altered miRs in AD males were CholinomiRs.
Similarly, inverse changes were seen in the population of CholinomiRs
(Methods): while 84 of 144 (58%) CholinomiRs were reduced in the
NAc of AD males (p <0.03), 56% of CholinomiRs in the NAc of females
were elevated (80/143,p <0.09).
In the STG, we identified only a single miR, which was not a Choli-
nomiR whose level was significantly reduced in AD females (Figure2B,
Ta b l eS8). At the population level, 58% (93/160) of the CholinomiRs
were significantly reduced in AD females (P<0.03), while CholinomiRs
reduction was not significant in AD males (50%, 84/168,p <0.53). In
the hypothalamus, we identified a single miR, which was not a Choli-
nomiR, whose level was significantly reduced in AD males (T ableS9).
At the population level, CholinomiRs were more significantly reduced
in females (62%, 85/138,p < 4 × 10−3) than in males (56%, 79/141,
p <0.09).
T aken together, these findings point at a complex network of gene
expression regulation that differs between tRFs and miRs, between
females and males and between brain regions. We find substantial sex-
specific differences in the regulation of the cholinergic system in the
NAc. These include substantial changes in CholinotRFs in AD females,
but almost no changes in CholinomiRs, while the opposite trend, sub-
stantial changes in miRs and less so in CholinotRFs, were observed in
males with AD.
3.4 Low CholinotRF levels in the NAc of AD
females are correlated with elevated levels of
cholinergic mRNAs
Short tRFs are likely to interact with and suppress the translatability of
mRNAs carrying complementary sequences21,22,26 (Figure 1). There-
fore, we hypothesized that a reduction in the levels of CholinotRFs
in the NAc of AD females will be accompanied by elevated levels of
cholinergic mRNAs. To test this prediction, we used a permutation test
to identify those genes, out of the 58 genes associated with ACh pro-
duction and cholinergic regulation37–50 (T ableS10), whose levels were
significantly modified in AD compared to control groups (Methods).

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
 SHULMAN ET AL. 5165
Consistent with our hypothesis, the levels of 93% (13/14 genes) of
the significantly altered mRNAs associated with ACh-production and
cholinergic regulation were elevated in females (p <9 ×10−4). In com-
parison, in males only seven genes displayed altered levels, and they
were all elevated (p <8 ×10−3).
Next, we focused our attention on the specific CholinotRFs that
exhibited a significant reduction in the NAc of AD females (6/98). Of
these 6 tRFs, 5 shared similar targets. Therefore, while each of these
CholinotRFs targeted 15–16 cholinergic targets, together they tar-
geted only 18 targets (out of the 58 cholinergic genes). This similarity
in targets was due to the fact that all 5 tRFs originated from the same
tRNA (mitochondria-derived PheGAA)( F i g u r e3A,T a b l eS3, Methods).
We hypothesized that the levels of these 18 targets will be particu-
larly affected in females with AD. Indeed, the mRNA levels of 33.3%
(6/18) of the cholinergic targets of these CholinotRFs were signifi-
cantly increased in AD females compared to controls. Considering the
remaining 40 cholinergic genes, only 17.5% (7/40) exhibited a signifi-
cant increase in AD females (p <0.08). In comparison, in males only 6%
(1/18) of the target genes and 15% (6/40) of the non-targeted genes
were significantly increased.
Previous studies have linked the six significantly elevated target
mRNAs reported here with AD or related pathways. For example,
RORA is elevated in the AD hippocampus,55 and is genetically linked
to AD56 (p <0.06, 0.39 for females and males, respectively); PCYT1A is
elevated in the AD hippocampus compared to controls57 (p <3 ×10−4,
0.01); KLF4 and LIFR were suggested to serve as AD therapy tar-
gets based on bioinformatic analyses of therapeutic pathways58,59
(KLF4: p < 0.09, 0.90; LIFR:p < 0.06, 0.98); also, RORA, KLF4, and
KLF7 (p < 0.06, 0.27) are regulators of the circadian rhythm,42,60,61
a process that affects cholinergic differentiation and activity,19 and
which notably deteriorates in AD; and BMP2 regulates the Wnt/𝛽-
catenin pathway which is dysfunctional in several diseases, including
AD62 (p <0.03, 0.22). Therefore, these findings supported our work-
ing hypothesis that sncRNAs in the NAc may operate as regulators
of cholinergic associated genes and contribute to the female-specific
disease expression.
3.5 Unexpected changes in STG and
hypothalamus cholinergic mRNAs
Compared with the NAc, AD-associated changes in cholinergic sncR-
NAs in the hypothalamus and STG were modest. Therefore, we
expected to see fewer AD-related changes in hypothalamus and STG
cholinergic mRNAs in general and no elevation in these genes in partic-
ular. These predictions were only partially confirmed as we did find a
substantial number of cholinergic genes whose level significantly dif-
fered between the control and AD states. In the hypothalamus, we
identified three and eight genes whose levels significantly changed in
females and males, respectively (FigureS3). These changes were even
more pronounced in the STG, where the levels of 22 and 18 cholin-
ergic genes changed significantly in females and males, respectively
(Figure S4). However, consistent with our prediction, there was no sig-
nificant elevation of cholinergic mRNAs (hypothalamus: females: 1/3,
p <0.88; males: 5/8,p <0.37); STG: females: 14/22,p <0.14, males:
10/18, p <0.41).
3.6 Altered levels of STG cholinergic transcripts
can be explained by changes in distinct cell
populations
The altered levels of cholinergic sncRNAs and mRNAs found in the
NAc of AD cases, and AD females in particular, are attributed to
cholinergic neurons in the Nac.17 However, this would not explain
the altered levels of cholinergic mRNAs found in the hypothalamus
and STG, since these regions lack cholinergic neurons63 Neverthe-
less, previous studies identified AD-related cholinergic changes in
other cell populations, including oligodendrocytes,64 astrocytes,65 and
microglia.14 Therefore, we performed studies to identify the cell types
that contributed to the altered levels of cholinergic mRNAs seen
in these extra NAc regions. Specifically, we used single-cell RNA-
Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from the SEA-AD study (Methods), to
determine cell type-specific changes in cortical neurons. To pursue
the potential cell types where such changes could occur, we com-
pared Medial Temporal Gyrus (MTG, which is located next to the
STG in the brain, Figure4A) data from control and AD brains, as the
changes were more pronounced in the STG than in the hypothala-
mus. The data included classification to 24 distinct cell populations
(Figure 4B), of which 18 were of neuronal origin and 6 of non-
neuronal origin (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, OPCs, microglia-PVM,
endothelial and VLMC). Notably, the non-neuronal cells constituted
only ∼20% (20.7% in females, 19.3% in males) of all the cells in the
analysis.
First, we tested whether the MTG scRNA-Seq results are compa-
rable with the STG bulk RNA-Seq. Finding such a consistency is not a
trivial result for two reasons. First, while these regions are adjacent,
they are not identical and therefore mRNA levels could differ between
the two regions. Second, scRNA-Seq measures mRNA levels in the
soma, whereas bulk RNA-Seq measures mRNA levels throughout the
region, which includes neurites and extensions of non-neuronal cells.
We focused on genes that passed the expression threshold (Meth-
ods) from among the cholinergic genes associated with ACh production
and cholinergic regulation (31 genes, T ableS10), as previous studies
reported unreliable detection of changes in genes with low expres-
sion levels in scRNA-Seq.66 To test for consistency, we represented the
expression of each gene in healthy and AD states as a linear combi-
nation of the mean gene expression in each cell type and the relative
weight of the number of cells in each population (Figure4C; dots,
Ta b l eS11). A linear regression on the log fold changes of these tran-
script levels in the STG bulk RNA-Seq and in the linear combinations
representing gene expression in the MTG exhibited a slope that is
significantly positive for both females and males (slope= 0.42, 0.36;
p < 8 × 10−4, 0.01 for females and males, respectively) (Figure4C;
solid line, Methods), demonstrating that the two measurements are
consistent with each other.

With the scRNA-Seq measurements, we can go beyond the bulk
RNA-Seq results and study the specific cellular changes associated
with the disease. For each population of cells, we computed the change
in thefraction of cells, a measure of specific cell death (or formation),
and the change in the transcript level of cholinergic genes, quanti-
fied by the correlation between the vectors of expression in control
compared to AD (Figure4D, Methods). In general, the correlation coef-
ficients were relatively high across cell populations, suggesting that the
expression levels within a single population were relatively mild. By
contrast, there were significant changes in the fractions of cells, indi-
cating vulnerability of specific cell populations within the AD brain.
Interestingly, the observed changes were more prominent in males, a

result that is consistent with the observation that the cortex is affected
more severely in males compared to females in AD.67
Of particular interest is the observation of a general increase in the
glial cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia-PVM) in
AD females. The opposite trend was observed in males. Notably, while
the amounts of glial cells decreased in AD males compared to con-
trols, the decrease in the number of neurons was greater and led to an
increase in the relative percentage of glia (Figure4D,T a b l eS11). For a

3.7 CholinotRFs exhibit sex-related elevations
during cholinergic differentiation of
human-originated neuroblastoma cells
Our definition of CholinotRFs was based on sequence-based comple-
mentarity with cholinergic genes. To challenge their role in cholinergic
regulation, we studied changes in small RNA-seq transcripts in human
neuroblastoma cell lines from male and female origins (LA-N-2, LA-
N-5) 2 days after exposure to neurokines that induce cholinergic

differentiation43 (Figure 5A, Methods). We hypothesized that differen-
tiation would lead to elevated levels of all cholinergic RNAs, including
CholinotRFs, related to cholinergic production.
Indeed, following 2 days of treatment we found substantial
increases in the levels of CholinotRFs in male originated cell lines. Of
308 CholinotRFs passing the expression threshold, the levels of most
increased (65%, 201/308,p <5 ×10−8;T a b l eS14). This increase was
specific to CholinotRFs, as no such increase was observed in non-
cholinergic tRFs (39%, 279/710, Fisher’s exact testp < 1 × 10−15;
Figure 5B). Surprisingly, we did not observe similar increases in female
originated cell lines: the levels of only 38% (118/308) of CholinotRFs
were elevated (compared with 35% of non-cholinergic tRFs, 247/710,
Fisher’s exact testp < 0.29; Figure 5B;T a b l eS15). Since a previous
study reported that neuronal cholinergic differentiation is a slower
process that matures around 4 days,43 we further examined tRF lev-
els 4 days after exposure to neurokines. At this time point, CholinotRF
levels were elevated in the differentiated cells in both lines (LA-N-2:
77%, 209/273,p <1 ×10−10; LA-N-5: 64%, 174/273p <3.5 ×10−5;
T ablesS16–S17). This increase was not found in non-cholinergic tRFs
(LA-N-2: 47%, 335/706 non-cholinergic tRFs increased; LA-N-5: 33%,
234/706; Figure5B). The relative change was even larger in the female-
originated cell line than in the male-originated cell line (p < 0.01).
Thus, CholinotRFs were lost faster in the NAc of AD females compared
to males NAc and were gained more profoundly in female-originated
neuroblastoma cells compared to male neuroblastoma cells under
cholinergic differentiation.
T aken together, these results strengthen the link between the
sequence-defined cholinotRFs and cholinergic regulation. Moreover,
they support the finding of sex-related differences in the cholinergic
regulation of AD via sncRNAs.
4 DISCUSSION
While the cholinergic hypothesis of AD13 has received less attention in
recent years, the accelerated damage to ACh producing neurons and
the cognitive decline in females with AD19 call for exploring the molec-
ular processes controlling cholinergic dysfunction. Here, we focused on
miRs and tRFs as regulators of ACh production and cholinergic regula-
tion in brain regions and cell types with diverse cholinergic activities.
To pursue potential regulators of the more severe and more frequent
AD in females compared to males,8 we compared RNA-Seq datasets
of NAc, STG, and hypothalamus from AD and non-cognitively impaired
elderly. We sought sex-specific changes in miRs/tRFs and their target
mRNA levels, compared scRNA-Seq patterns derived from a closely
related brain region and pursued miR/tRF changes in neuronal cell lines
of human male and female origin under cholinergic differentiation.
Greater changes in cholinergic RNAs were found in females with AD
compared to males. Overall tRF levels were also reduced in females and
the reduction in cholinotRFs correlated with larger increases of cholin-
ergic mRNAs in the NAc of AD females. We also observed changes in
cholinergic mRNA levels in non-neuronal cell populations from cortical
 15525279, 2023, 11, Downloaded from https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13095 by Cochrane Russian Federation, Wiley Online Library on [07/01/2026].

tissues of AD females; and slower response to cholinergic differentia-
tion that may be causally linked to the exacerbated cognitive decline in
AD females.7–9
The cholinergic hypothesis posits that loss of cholinergic neu-
rons contributes substantially to the cognitive decline in those with
advanced age and AD.13,19 Here, we found greater AD-related changes
in miRs/tRFs regulating cholinergic processes in the female NAc, indi-
cating that small RNA regulators of cholinergic mRNA targets are
affected more significantly in the NAc, which is enriched in choliner-
gic neurons compared to brain regions lacking ACh positive cells such
as the STG and hypothalamus.17,63,68,69 Furthermore, the NAc of AD
females but not males revealed region-specific reductions in the lev-
els of tRFs capable of targeting cholinergic genes and an accompanying
elevation of cholinergic target transcripts in the NAc (e.g., RORA,42
BMP2,50 LIFR,59 PCYT1A,45 KLF4,41 and KLF761), all associated with
AD or related pathways. These may temporarily re-balance choliner-
gic signaling in the NAc of AD females compared to non-cholinergic
regions such as the hypothalamus.68
The NAc’s role in learning, memory, and cholinergic signaling is
well established,69 supporting the pronounced miR/tRF changes in the
NAc. Additionally, the observed changes associate well with the cog-
nitive impairment rather than with NFTs and neuritic plaques in both
AD females and males, compatible with these regions’ involvement in
learning and memory processes and cholinergic signaling.69 Our find-
ings of modified miR/tRF levels related to the clinical rather than the
neuropathological characteristics lends support to the current diagno-
sis of AD based upon the diagnostic state of the patient reported by
clinicians.70 The null association of cholinergic transcripts with amy-
loid and tau lesions further suggested a greater role for cholinergic
dysfunction in the onset of cognitive decline in AD.
Intriguingly, CholinotRF levels were reduced in the NAc of both
AD females and males, albeit to different extents, whereas Choli-
nomiR levels were elevated only in AD females. Inverse reductions of
CholinomiRs and CholinotRFs elevations occur in post-stroke nucle-
ated blood cells.27 However, nucleated blood cells continue to divide,
unlike brain neurons, and stroke has a rapid onset and drastic systemic
changes, which occur within a short time frame,27 unlike the slower
onset of cognitive decline seen in AD, where rapid production of reg-
ulatory miR/tRFs may be unsustainable. Together, our findings suggest
that fundamental differences between immunologic responses to rapid
brain insults underlie the decreases in CholinotRFs that likely reflect a
long-term depletion of the tRF stores in the AD female brain. That we
also found AD-linked changes in the NAc levels of miRs in AD males
but not females, which potentially indicates an imbalanced miRs reg-
ulation in females, highlighting the potential links between miRs and
tRFs control and the importance of analyzing disease RNA markers in a
sex-specific manner.
Our finding of a reduced levels of MT-tRFs in the AD NAc and
their link to cognitive impairments extend previous studies link-
ing mitochondrial impairment to neurodegenerative and psychiatric
disorders.8 Additional studies identified MT-tRFs as key regulators
in nuclear-mitochondrial communication,71 which is dysfunctional in
many neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Hence, the associa-
tion between tRFs of mitochondrial origin that carry motifs comple-
mentary to those of cholinergic transcripts, resemble the enriched
sequence-based motifs to cholinergic transcripts in MT-tRFs from the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of donors with Parkinson’s dis-
ease (PD).72 These results suggest that the mitochondrial damage in
neurodegenerative disorders such as PD and AD relates to the failed
regulation of cholinergic targets by CholinotRFs, and potentially to a
broader cholinergic and mitochondrial linked defect.
Surprisingly, we observed mRNA changes associated with ACh
production and cholinergic regulation in the hypothalamus and
the STG, although these regions lack cholinergic neurons.63 How-
ever, previous reports presented AD-related cholinergic changes
in oligodendrocytes,64 astrocytes,65 and microglia.14 Therefore, we
asked if the observed STG bulk RNA-Seq changes occurred in non-
neuronal populations. Indeed, the MTG of AD donors compared to
apparently healthy aged controls was compatible with contribution of
different cell populations to the identified changes, and the linear com-
binations representing gene expression in the MTG were consistent
with the altered STG bulk RNA-Seq.
In both AD females and males, our MTG small RNA changes were
attributed to the alterations in cell numbers, rather than expression
changes in each cell population. Of those, the relative percentage of
affected cells was of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia-PVMs
in both AD females and males. Specifically, non-neuronal populations
were enlarged in cognitively impaired females compared to controls,
contrasting with a reduction in cognitively impaired males. Further-
more, the cholinergic transcripts whose levels were modified in our
bulk RNA-Seq could be attributed to MTG glia. Others have reported
that vulnerable oligodendrocytes in AD may induce myelin breakdown
and loss of the myelin sheath, which might initiate the earliest stage
of AD prior to appearance of amyloid and tau pathology.64 Astrocytes
also contribute to neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration.73 In addi-
tion, PVMs may contribute to clearance of brain neuritic plaques, and
microglia play multiple AD-associated effects. Therefore, the changes
of these gene targets in MTG non-neuronal populations of donors
diagnosed with AD provide a potential mechanistic explanation that
supports and validates those reports, as well as the changes in STG
cholinergic mRNAs. Interestingly, the observed changes were more
prominent in males, consistent with the observation that in AD, the
cortex is affected more severely in males compared with females.67
Linear regression verified consistent, albeit non-perfectly fit AD-
related changes of cholinergic mRNAs between the two regions. This is
compatible with the extraction of RNA for scRNA-Seq from the nucleus
alone, missing transcripts from other areas of the cell (e.g., dendrites);
also, the small RNA amounts in single cells require many rounds of
amplification prior to sequencing, leading to strong amplification bias
and dropouts of genes74; hence, scRNA-Seq data exhibit high vari-
ability between technical replicates, influencing the overall transcript
levels.75
To challenge CholinotRFs’ roles in cholinergic regulation, we ana-
lyzed small RNA-Seq data from cell lines of female and male origins
after cholinergic differentiation,51 expecting elevated CholinotRF lev-
els. Indeed, 4 days exposure to neurokines increased CholinotRF levels

in differentiated cell lines of both female and male origins, compared
to the original cell lines, supporting their role in cholinergic regulation.
Intriguingly, male-originated cells showed elevated CholinotRF levels
compared to non-cholinergic tRFs 2 days under neurokines exposure,
but a larger effect was observed after 4 days. However, female cells
showed reduced levels of most CholinotRFs after 2 days, supporting
the sex-specific CholinotRF changes in the AD brains.
ChEI remain the main current strategy for treating AD symptoms.
The NAc is targeted by therapeutic muscarinic agonists, which have
shown some promise in clinical trials. Also, nicotinic receptor agonists
modify various NAc activities. However, ChEIs may cause serious side
effects, especially in females7,16; including exacerbated anticholinergic
burden15 highlighting the need for more finely tuned ChEI treat-
ments. Correspondingly, our findings point to considering cholinergic
impairments in female brains upon ChEIs prescription. Furthermore,
our findings revealed previously unknown correlation between tRF
declines predicted to target cholinergic genes with the female- and
NAc-specific elevation of those mRNA levels. Therefore, small RNA
regulators of the cholinergic tone in the diseased brain. Whether such
changes also occur in the nucleus basalis of Meynert remains to be
determined.
5 LIMITATIONS
We acknowledge limitations of our study, which did not define precise
implications of particular small RNA changes. Expression data from cell
lines of female- and male-origin before and after cholinergic differenti-
ation only reflect one cell type and a single mechanism underlying the
cholinergic changes in AD, calling for more complex model systems and
revealing the need for investigation of the molecular mechanisms oper-
ating in the various cell populations, and adequately powered studies
to address the pharmacological implications of our findings.
6 CONCLUSIONS
Our study identified declined mitochondrial genome-originated
cholinergic-targeting tRFs (CholinotRFs) in the NAc of cognitively
impaired donors that was greater in females than in males, similar to
the more prevalent and rapid cognitive decline in females. Notably,
the reduced CholinotRF levels in the NAc of AD females were accom-
panied by elevated levels of their complementary cholinergic mRNA
transcripts, indicating that the observed decline interrupted the
miR-like properties of CholinotRFs that limit cholinergic features and
supporting the relevance of this change for the cholinergic hypothesis
of AD. The CholinotRF declines were specific to the NAc, where the
density of ACh-producing neurons is relatively high, compared with
brain regions such as the STG and the hypothalamus. Single-cell RNA-
Seq discovered altered cholinergic transcripts in cortical non-neuronal
cell populations including microglia, expanding the implications of our
findings to the altered cortical cholinergic mRNA levels, the regulation
mechanisms of which are still unknown. These findings support the
sex-specific involvement of tRFs depletion in cholinergic regulation,
providing pivotal insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying
AD; which may shed new light on the impact of anticholinesterases
treatment for AD, and lead to a sex-adjusted prescription.

 ","The study investigates sex-specific declines in cholinergic-targeting tRNA fragments in the nucleus accumbens of Alzheimer's disease patients. The researchers used a combination of RNA sequencing, proteomics, and bioinformatics to analyze post-mortem brain samples from 140 individuals with varying stages of AD. They found that male and female patients showed distinct patterns of tRNA fragment expression, particularly for cholinergic-targeting fragments. These declines were more pronounced in females compared to males, suggesting a potential sex-specific vulnerability to AD pathology. The study also identified several genes associated with these changes, including RORA, which plays a role in circadian rhythm and has been linked to Alzheimer's disease. The findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences in understanding and treating AD.","Introduction: Females with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) suffer accelerated dementia and loss of cholinergic neurons compared to males, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Seeking causal contributors to both these phenomena, we pursued changes in transfer RNS (tRNA) fragments (tRFs) targeting cholinergic transcripts (CholinotRFs). Methods: We analyzed small RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) brain region which is enriched in cholinergic neurons, compared to hypothalamic or cortical tissues from AD brains; and explored small RNA expression in neuronal cell lines undergoing cholinergic differentiation. Results: NAc CholinotRFs of mitochondrial genome origin showed reduced levels that correlated with elevations in their predicted cholinergic-associated mRNA targets. Single-cell RNA seq from AD temporal cortices showed altered sex-specific levels of cholinergic transcripts in diverse cell types; inversely, human-originated neuroblastoma cells under cholinergic differentiation presented sex-specific CholinotRF elevations. Discussion: Our findings support CholinotRFs contributions to cholinergic regulation, predicting their involvement in AD sex-specific cholinergic loss and dementia.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, globally affecting over 50 million people.1 Its clinical symptoms reflect accelerating failure of regulatory, neurochemical, and neural networks, initiating with the cholinergic system and leading to a progressive cognitive deterioration. Neuropathologic features in subcortical nuclei2 precede neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) development within the mesial temporal cortex.3 AD lesions involve accumulation of multimeric amyloid-β fibrils forming neuritic plaques and NFTs consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau and leading to loss of synapses, dendrites, and, eventually, neurons.1 However, the mechanisms underlying AD-related dementia, which develops relatively late in the disease course4 are a matter of controversy.5 Clustered cholinergic neurons in the substantia innominate/nucleus basalis of Meynert6 are the most investigated site of acetylcholine (Ach) producing interneurons within the nucleus accumbens (Nac). They contribute to cognitive and motivational behavior and loss of these neurons predicts progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. This is faster in females even when considering their longer life expectancy.7–9 Females score lower than males on tests of cognitive domains,10 even after controlling for possible demographic and genetic factors, and show more pronounced mitochondrial imbalances11 and loss of cholinergic neurons.12 The reduced cholinergic activity in basal cholinergic forebrain neurons and their cortical projection sites supports the “cholinergic hypothesis of AD,”13 which argues that dysfunction of Ach-producing brain neurons contributes to the AD-related cognitive decline. Consequently, the development of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) is one of the few treatments for AD.14 ChEIs do not prevent or slow disease progression. They may independently lead to cognitive dysfunction and delirium,15 are more effective in males and cause more pronounced adverse effects in females with AD.7,16 Additionally, muscarinic agonists have shown some clinical promise, and modulate various impairments seen in AD, affecting both the cortical cholinergic basal forebrain system and the 1%–2% of Nac Ach-producing neurons17 that project to brain regions including cortical areas.18 Correspondingly, dysfunction of cholinergic pathways in both the basal forebrain and the Nac contribute to cognitive decline in AD.19,20 Both whole tissue and single-cell AD studies revealed changes in coding and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcript levels, but their involvement in cholinergic cellular dysfunction remained unknown. Those included microRNAs (miRs), small single-stranded ncRNAs about 22 nucleotides long that target mRNA molecules and function as post-transcriptional regulators.21 Therefore, individual miR levels are co-altered in the AD brain with their experimentally validated targets.22 Furthermore, sex-specific miR profiles modulate responses to tau pathology23 and sex- and age-related Ach signals24 in AD, yielding sex-specific biomarkers for multiple neurodegenerative disorders.25 However, Nac AD miRs remain under-investigated. Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived fragments (tRFs) are a recently rediscovered small non-coding RNA regulators that were previously considered to be inactive products of tRNA degradation. The tRFs are derived by specific tRNA cleavage of several different nucleases, including Dicer, Drosha, and Angiogenin26 (Figure 1). All tRFs up to 30 nucleotides in length may function like miRs by modulating the expression of mRNA targets carrying complementary sequence motifs.26 In nucleated blood cells, tRFs targeting cholinergic transcripts replace miRs in regulating cholinergic reactions during ischemic stroke.27 Moreover, certain tRFs regulate ribosomal function, cancer, innate immunity, stress responses, and neurological disorders.28 The tRFs may originate from nuclear or mitochondrial genomes26 and mitochondrial disfunction is a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.8 While AD involves changes in miRs targeting mitochondrial genes,29 the role of mitochondrial-originated tRFs in cholinergic neurons, as well as their sex-specific profiles and genetic origins in AD have not yet been investigated. Pursuing cholinergic-targeting tRFs and/or miRs (CholinotRFs, CholinomiRs) that may affect AD pathology and its disease course and cognitive decline, we sought changes in their predicted mRNA targets in AD and healthy non-cognitively impaired elderly control cases; examined the specific cell populations that express these cholinergic mRNA targets in single-cell RNA-Seq from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and studied the role of CholinotRFs in cholinergic regulation in cell lines of human origin.","3.1 NAc CholinotRFs decline in AD females To identify disease- and sex-specific changes in the NAc sncRNA profiles, we analyzed small RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of aged donors with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. The cholinergic hypothesis of AD states that dysfunction of ACh-producing brain neurons contributes to the cognitive decline. Therefore, we classified the donors according to their clinical diagnosis: controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI) (65; 35 females, 30 males) and persons diagnosed with AD (47; 28 females and 19 males) (Methods, TableS1).31–33 To find AD-associated changes in short tRFs, we applied a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test on control and AD short RNA-Seq reads (Methods). We found substantial differences in the levels of sncRNAs between males and females. Specifically, in females, we identified 10 tRFs with altered levels (FDR corrected p ≤ 0.152) (FigureS1, TableS3). In males, by contrast, no significant alterations in tRFs were found (Figure2A). AD involves the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques. However, their link to cognitive decline is unclear.4 Therefore, we asked to what extent changes in short tRFs and miRs will manifest when AD is classified according to these neuropathological features, rather than the level of cognitive decline (TableS1). When classifying the donors according to neuritic plaques we found no significant differences in the levels of sncRNAs (FigureS2A, Methods). When classifying them according to NFTs, we identified only a single tRF that significantly differed between the two groups (FigureS2B, TableS4, Methods). These results support the use of cognitive impairment rather than neuropathology as a measure of disease severity. Based on the cholinergic hypothesis, we hypothesized that the AD-related changes in tRFs will be particularly pronounced in those tRFs containing complementary sequences to cholinergic genes. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a list of 58 genes associated with ACh production and cholinergic regulation (TableS10, denoted as “ACh Production” or “Cholinergic Regulation,”37–50 based on our previous work43), of which seven genes were denoted as “Core”38,43 genes based on their key roles in the cholinergic pathway (TableS10). For each sncRNA, we used the microT prediction tool to find its cholinergic targets.35 This identified approximately a quarter of sncRNAs likely to be involved in ACh production and cholinergic regulation (Methods). Focusing on tRFs whose level was significantly altered in AD compared to control state, 6 of the 10 tRFs altered in females were CholinotRFs, while only 25% of all the tRFs (98/401) were identified as CholinotRFs (p <0.02) (Methods). The levels of all six significant NAc CholinotRFs were reduced in AD females (p <0.02). We were therefore wondering whether this reduction is only the tip of an iceberg and reflects a more general reduction in the level of CholinotRFs, including in those tRFs that did not cross the significance level. Indeed, in females, the level of 74% (68/92) of the remaining (no significant change) CholinotRFs was lower in the AD than in the control state, while the level of only 26% (24/92) was higher (p < 3 × 10−6). By contrast, no such reduction was observed in the non-CholinotRFs (36%, 108/303 decreased; 64%, 195/303 increased). A similar tendency, to lesser extent, was also observed in males: 70% (68/97) of CholinotRFs decreased and 30% (31/97) of CholinotRFs increased (p <5 ×10−5); 47% (135/288) of non-CholinotRFs decreased and 53% (153/288) of non-CholinotRFs increased. Caution should be exercised when interpreting this result, because the classification of tRFs into CholinotRFs and non-CholinotRFs is correlated with their origin, mitochondrial (MT) or nuclear (non-MT). For example, in females, 82% (80/97) of the CholinotRFs are also MT-tRFs, whereas only 10% (29/303) of the non-CholinotRFs are also MT-tRFs. We, therefore, used logistic regression to test whether the potential function of a tRF (CholinotRF vs. non-CholinotRF) is correlated with its reduction in AD, even when its origin (MT vs. non-MT) is accounted for (Methods). The regression coefficients indicate that both in females and in males, the potential function of a studied tRF as cholinergic regulator is correlated with its reduction in the AD NAc (females: regression coefficient 1.1, p < 1 × 10−4; males: regression coefficient 1.1, p <9 ×10−4), whereas the regression coefficient for the origin was not statistically significant (females: regression coefficient 0.006, p <0.98; males: regression coefficient−0.25, p <0.35), indicating that the effect in MT-tRFs derived from their potential function as cholinergic regulators. 3.2 tRF decline is more pronounced in the NAc than in other brain regions It is important to note that only a small fraction of NAc neurons is cholinergic, limiting the interpretation of the RNA-Seq data that were derived from a heterogenous population of NAc neurons. To test whether the change in tRFs reflects changes in the NAc cholinergic neurons, we repeated the analysis in two additional brain regions, the STG and hypothalamus. The STG is a cortical region that was previously linked to AD, presenting epigenetic modifications in persons with AD according to their pathogenesis,53 whereas the hypothalamus is a subcortical region that is relatively spared.54 We classified small-RNA profiles extracted from the STG and hypothalamus of controls (STG: 11 females, 11 males; hypothalamus: 15 females, 11 males) and donors diagnosed with AD (STG: 10 females, 6 males; hypothalamus: 20 females, 10 males) (TableS1). In the STG, we identified only 2 tRFs whose levels are significantly changed in females between the control and AD groups. None of these tRFs was a CholinotRF (TableS5). In the hypothalamus, we did not find any tRFs that differed between the two groups. In agreement with these results, the reduction in the global level of CholinotRFs was modest, statistically significant only for males in the STG and females in the hypothalamus (STG females: 57%, 55/97, p < 0.11, males: 62%, 65/104, p < 7 × 10−3; hypothalamus females: 58%, 54/93, p < 0.07; males: 40%, 36/92, p < 0.99). These findings lend support to the potential cholinergic relevance of our NAc observations. While the dorsomedial portion of the hypothalamus contains cholinergic neurons,54 our findings in the hypothalamus part that is non-cholinergic were compatible with the link between the altered tRFs in the NAc and their functional relevance to cholinergic neurons. 3.3 AD-related changes in miR levels differ substantially from AD-related changes in tRFs Many studies have reported post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRs.14,21,27 Therefore, if the changes in tRFs merely reflect changes in the fraction of cholinergic neurons (as a result of cell death) then a similar pattern of change in miRs is expected in AD. However, miRs exhibited very different behaviors from those of tRFs. While substantial changes in the levels of tRFs were observed in the in NAc of AD females, but not males, the opposite pattern was observed in miRs. In males, we identified 13 miRs whose levels were significantly altered between the AD and control groups (Figure2B, TableS6), while only a single miR was significantly altered in females (TableS7). Intriguingly, the single significantly reduced miR in the NAc of AD females was a CholinomiR (the well-studied AChE-targeting miR-132-3p24), while 5 of the 13 significantly altered miRs in AD males were CholinomiRs. Similarly, inverse changes were seen in the population of CholinomiRs (Methods): while 84 of 144 (58%) CholinomiRs were reduced in the NAc of AD males (p <0.03), 56% of CholinomiRs in the NAc of females were elevated (80/143, p <0.09). In the STG, we identified only a single miR, which was not a CholinomiR whose level was significantly reduced in AD females (Figure2B, TableS8). At the population level, 58% (93/160) of the CholinomiRs were significantly reduced in AD females (P<0.03), while CholinomiRs reduction was not significant in AD males (50%, 84/168, p <0.53). In the hypothalamus, we identified a single miR, which was not a CholinomiR, whose level was significantly reduced in AD males (TableS9). At the population level, CholinomiRs were more significantly reduced in females (62%, 85/138, p < 4 × 10−3) than in males (56%, 79/141, p <0.09). Taken together, these findings point at a complex network of gene expression regulation that differs between tRFs and miRs, between females and males and between brain regions. We find substantial sex-specific differences in the regulation of the cholinergic system in the NAc. These include substantial changes in CholinotRFs in AD females, but almost no changes in CholinomiRs, while the opposite trend, substantial changes in miRs and less so in CholinotRFs, were observed in males with AD. 3.4 Low CholinotRF levels in the NAc of AD females are correlated with elevated levels of cholinergic mRNAs Short tRFs are likely to interact with and suppress the translatability of mRNAs carrying complementary sequences21,22,26 (Figure 1). Therefore, we hypothesized that a reduction in the levels of CholinotRFs in the NAc of AD females will be accompanied by elevated levels of cholinergic mRNAs. To test this prediction, we used a permutation test to identify those genes, out of the 58 genes associated with ACh production and cholinergic regulation37–50 (TableS10), whose levels were significantly modified in AD compared to control groups (Methods). Consistent with our hypothesis, the levels of 93% (13/14 genes) of the significantly altered mRNAs associated with ACh-production and cholinergic regulation were elevated in females (p <9 ×10−4). In comparison, in males only seven genes displayed altered levels, and they were all elevated (p <8 ×10−3). Next, we focused our attention on the specific CholinotRFs that exhibited a significant reduction in the NAc of AD females (6/98). Of these 6 tRFs, 5 shared similar targets. Therefore, while each of these CholinotRFs targeted 15–16 cholinergic targets, together they targeted only 18 targets (out of the 58 cholinergic genes). This similarity in targets was due to the fact that all 5 tRFs originated from the same tRNA (mitochondria-derived PheGAA) (Figure3A, TableS3, Methods). We hypothesized that the levels of these 18 targets will be particularly affected in females with AD. Indeed, the mRNA levels of 33.3% (6/18) of the cholinergic targets of these CholinotRFs were significantly increased in AD females compared to controls. Considering the remaining 40 cholinergic genes, only 17.5% (7/40) exhibited a significant increase in AD females (p <0.08). In comparison, in males only 6% (1/18) of the target genes and 15% (6/40) of the non-targeted genes were significantly increased. Previous studies have linked the six significantly elevated target mRNAs reported here with AD or related pathways. For example, RORA is elevated in the AD hippocampus,55 and is genetically linked to AD56 (p <0.06, 0.39 for females and males, respectively); PCYT1A is elevated in the AD hippocampus compared to controls57 (p <3 ×10−4, 0.01); KLF4 and LIFR were suggested to serve as AD therapy targets based on bioinformatic analyses of therapeutic pathways58,59 (KLF4: p < 0.09, 0.90; LIFR: p < 0.06, 0.98); also, RORA, KLF4, and KLF7 (p < 0.06, 0.27) are regulators of the circadian rhythm,42,60,61 a process that affects cholinergic differentiation and activity,19 and which notably deteriorates in AD; and BMP2 regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway which is dysfunctional in several diseases, including AD62 (p <0.03, 0.22). Therefore, these findings supported our working hypothesis that sncRNAs in the NAc may operate as regulators of cholinergic associated genes and contribute to the female-specific disease expression. 3.5 Unexpected changes in STG and hypothalamus cholinergic mRNAs Compared with the NAc, AD-associated changes in cholinergic sncRNAs in the hypothalamus and STG were modest. Therefore, we expected to see fewer AD-related changes in hypothalamus and STG cholinergic mRNAs in general and no elevation in these genes in particular. These predictions were only partially confirmed as we did find a substantial number of cholinergic genes whose level significantly differed between the control and AD states. In the hypothalamus, we identified three and eight genes whose levels significantly changed in females and males, respectively (FigureS3). These changes were even more pronounced in the STG, where the levels of 22 and 18 cholinergic genes changed significantly in females and males, respectively (Figure S4). However, consistent with our prediction, there was no significant elevation of cholinergic mRNAs (hypothalamus: females: 1/3, p <0.88; males: 5/8, p <0.37); STG: females: 14/22, p <0.14, males: 10/18, p <0.41). 3.6 Altered levels of STG cholinergic transcripts can be explained by changes in distinct cell populations The altered levels of cholinergic sncRNAs and mRNAs found in the NAc of AD cases, and AD females in particular, are attributed to cholinergic neurons in the Nac.17 However, this would not explain the altered levels of cholinergic mRNAs found in the hypothalamus and STG, since these regions lack cholinergic neurons.63 Nevertheless, previous studies identified AD-related cholinergic changes in other cell populations, including oligodendrocytes,64 astrocytes,65 and microglia.14 Therefore, we performed studies to identify the cell types that contributed to the altered levels of cholinergic mRNAs seen in these extra NAc regions. Specifically, we used single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from the SEA-AD study (Methods), to determine cell type-specific changes in cortical neurons. To pursue the potential cell types where such changes could occur, we compared Medial Temporal Gyrus (MTG, which is located next to the STG in the brain, Figure4A) data from control and AD brains, as the changes were more pronounced in the STG than in the hypothalamus. The data included classification to 24 distinct cell populations (Figure 4B), of which 18 were of neuronal origin and 6 of non-neuronal origin (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, OPCs, microglia-PVM, endothelial and VLMC). Notably, the non-neuronal cells constituted only ∼20% (20.7% in females, 19.3% in males) of all the cells in the analysis. First, we tested whether the MTG scRNA-Seq results are comparable with the STG bulk RNA-Seq. Finding such a consistency is not a trivial result for two reasons. First, while these regions are adjacent, they are not identical and therefore mRNA levels could differ between the two regions. Second, scRNA-Seq measures mRNA levels in the soma, whereas bulk RNA-Seq measures mRNA levels throughout the region, which includes neurites and extensions of non-neuronal cells. We focused on genes that passed the expression threshold (Methods) from among the cholinergic genes associated with ACh production and cholinergic regulation (31 genes, TableS10), as previous studies reported unreliable detection of changes in genes with low expression levels in scRNA-Seq.66 To test for consistency, we represented the expression of each gene in healthy and AD states as a linear combination of the mean gene expression in each cell type and the relative weight of the number of cells in each population (Figure4C; dots, TableS11). A linear regression on the log fold changes of these transcript levels in the STG bulk RNA-Seq and in the linear combinations representing gene expression in the MTG exhibited a slope that is significantly positive for both females and males (slope= 0.42, 0.36; p < 8 × 10−4, 0.01 for females and males, respectively) (Figure4C; solid line, Methods), demonstrating that the two measurements are consistent with each other. With the scRNA-Seq measurements, we can go beyond the bulk RNA-Seq results and study the specific cellular changes associated with the disease. For each population of cells, we computed the change in the fraction of cells, a measure of specific cell death (or formation), and the change in the transcript level of cholinergic genes, quantified by the correlation between the vectors of expression in control compared to AD (Figure4D, Methods). In general, the correlation coefficients were relatively high across cell populations, suggesting that the expression levels within a single population were relatively mild. By contrast, there were significant changes in the fractions of cells, indicating vulnerability of specific cell populations within the AD brain. Interestingly, the observed changes were more prominent in males, a result that is consistent with the observation that the cortex is affected more severely in males compared to females in AD.67 Of particular interest is the observation of a general increase in the glial cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia-PVM) in AD females. The opposite trend was observed in males. Notably, while the amounts of glial cells decreased in AD males compared to controls, the decrease in the number of neurons was greater and led to an increase in the relative percentage of glia (Figure4D, TableS11). For a complete list of changes, see TablesS11–S13. 3.7 CholinotRFs exhibit sex-related elevations during cholinergic differentiation of human-originated neuroblastoma cells Our definition of CholinotRFs was based on sequence-based complementarity with cholinergic genes. To challenge their role in cholinergic regulation, we studied changes in small RNA-seq transcripts in human neuroblastoma cell lines from male and female origins (LA-N-2, LA-N-5) 2 days after exposure to neurokines that induce cholinergic differentiation43 (Figure 5A, Methods). We hypothesized that differentiation would lead to elevated levels of all cholinergic RNAs, including CholinotRFs, related to cholinergic production. Indeed, following 2 days of treatment we found substantial increases in the levels of CholinotRFs in male originated cell lines. Of 308 CholinotRFs passing the expression threshold, the levels of most increased (65%, 201/308, p <5 ×10−8; TableS14). This increase was specific to CholinotRFs, as no such increase was observed in non-cholinergic tRFs (39%, 279/710, Fisher’s exact test p < 1 × 10−15; Figure 5B). Surprisingly, we did not observe similar increases in female originated cell lines: the levels of only 38% (118/308) of CholinotRFs were elevated (compared with 35% of non-cholinergic tRFs, 247/710, Fisher’s exact test p < 0.29; Figure 5B; TableS15). Since a previous study reported that neuronal cholinergic differentiation is a slower process that matures around 4 days,43 we further examined tRF levels 4 days after exposure to neurokines. At this time point, CholinotRF levels were elevated in the differentiated cells in both lines (LA-N-2: 77%, 209/273, p <1 ×10−10; LA-N-5: 64%, 174/273 p <3.5 ×10−5; TablesS16–S17). This increase was not found in non-cholinergic tRFs (LA-N-2: 47%, 335/706 non-cholinergic tRFs increased; LA-N-5: 33%, 234/706; Figure5B). The relative change was even larger in the female-originated cell line than in the male-originated cell line (p < 0.01). Thus, CholinotRFs were lost faster in the NAc of AD females compared to males NAc and were gained more profoundly in female-originated neuroblastoma cells compared to male neuroblastoma cells under cholinergic differentiation. Taken together, these results strengthen the link between the sequence-defined cholinotRFs and cholinergic regulation. Moreover, they support the finding of sex-related differences in the cholinergic regulation of AD via sncRNAs."

1.Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is gradually be-
coming the leading cause of dementia
worldwide, with the prevalence of AD
gradually increasing from 5.0% in peo-
ple aged 65–74 years to 33.2% in peo-
ple aged 85 years and older, resulting in
more than 52 million people being af-
fected worldwide.[1] The pathogenesis of
AD remains complex, but the most com-
mon explanation in recent studies is the
amyloidcascadehypothesis. [2,3] Theforma-
tion of A𝛽 plaques results from a series
of amyloid peptides that are abnormally
sheared. Excessive A𝛽 plaque accumula-
tion could disrupt brain microvascular en-
dothelial cells, impair the integrity of the
blood‒brainbarrier,andinduceinﬁltration
of innate immune cells and adaptive im-
munecellsfromoutsidethebrain,resulting
in disorders of the immune microenvironment in the brain.[4,5]
Therefore, remodeling the immune microenvironment and
eliminatingtheaccumulationofabnormalA 𝛽 inthebrainisone

Microglia are macrophages in the brain and spinal cord, and
they represent the primary line of immune defense in the cen-
tral nervous system, as they are mainly responsible for clearing
damagedneurons,A 𝛽 plaques,andinfectioussubstancesinthe
centralnervoussystem. [6] However,agingmicrogliainthebrains
ofADpatientsmaybecomedysfunctionalandmetabolicallyim-
paired, and their ability to clear A𝛽 is reduced, which results in
theformationofalargenumberofA 𝛽 plaques.[7,8] Ontheother
hand, microglia in the AD brain show excessive activation and
an uncontrolled state, and they can release many proinﬂamma-
tory factors (such as tumor necrosis factor TNF-𝛼, interleukin
IL-1𝛽, IL-6, etc.) and complement components, further causing
immuneinﬂammatorydamage. [9,10] Atthesametime,themem-

Inpreviousresearch,CD22wasfoundtobehighlyexpressed

enhanceA𝛽 clearancebymicroglia.Thus,aneﬀectivegenevec-
tor loaded with CD22 shRNA (RNAi) was designed to test this

are easily digested by intracellular nucleases.[14] At present, the
vectors for gene therapy mainly include viral vectors such as
lentivirus, adenovirus, and adeno-associated virus and nonviral
vectorssuchascationicliposomes,butduetotheirdrawbacksof
immunogenicity,oncogenicity,highcosts,andasinglefunction,
they are diﬃcult to translate to the clinic, and their applications
arelimited.Notably,metal-organicframeworks(MOFs)arecrys-
talline porous materials with periodic lattice structures that are

ligands; these structures have high porosity and a large speciﬁc
surfaceareaandcanadsorbplasmidDNAvianoncovalentforces
such as electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and
hydrogenbondingwhileprotectingitfromchemical and/oren-
zymatic degradation.[15,16] Chlorogenic acid (CA) is a phenolic
acid extracted from honeysuckle that can be used as an organic
ligand for the structure of metal-organic framework (MOF) CA
has antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inﬂammatory, and complement
activationinhibitoryeﬀects. [17] Therefore,ourresearchaimedto
synthesizeaZn-CAMOFbycombiningzincions(Zn 2+)withCA
fortheeﬃcientloadingofCD22shRNAandA 𝛽 aptamer.
However, nanoparticles can be easily recognized and cleared
as exogenous substances by the reticuloendothelial phagocytic
system in the body.[18] Red blood cells (RBCs), the most abun-
dant blood cells without nuclei in mammals, are the main
medium for oxygen delivery, and their cell membranes are
easy to prepare.[19,20] Moreover, the self-recognition molecule
CD47 on the surface of erythrocytes endows the encapsulated
nanoparticles with a long circulating half-life and immune eva-
sionfunction.[21,22] Inaddition,receptor-mediatedtranscytosisis
currently one of the most eﬀective ways to mediate crossing of
theblood‒brainbarrierbybiomolecules. [23] Transferrinreceptor
(TfR),oneofthemostrepresentativetranscytosisreceptors,was
distributedwidelyinendothelialcells,plexusepithelialcells,neu-
rons,andcommonglialcellinbraintissue.Inthisstudy,inspired
bymostreports,aTfRaptamerwasdesignedasaTfRligand. [24]
After binding to TfR, the nanosystem entered the blood–brain
barrier through transcytosis of brain endothelial cells, and was
thentakenupbymicroglia,neurons,andothercellscontaining
TfRs.[25,26]Thus, the resulting erythrocyte-camouﬂaged nanopar-
ticles were expected to protect the whole system from degrada-
tion, and the TfR aptamer, which was attached to the surface
of the erythrocyte membrane by lipid insertion, was predicted
to improve the ability of the system to reach the blood‒brain
barrier, both of which could play essential roles in enhancing
eﬃcacy.
Hence, in this study, we proposed the use of Zn2+ and CA
to construct a metal-organic framework Zn-CA (ZC), which si-
multaneously transports CD22 shRNA (RNAi) and A𝛽 aptamer
(AAP)toformaZC/RNAi/AAP(ZRA)nanocore.Finally,theTfR

2.ResultsandDiscussion
2.1.PreparationandCharacterizationofTR-ZC/RNAi/AAP
The primary process of TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP included incubation
ofZn2+ andCAtosynthesizeametal −organicframework(with
PEI, positive charge) and loading with RNAi and AAP (nega-
tive charge), which resulted in the formation of ZC/RNAi/AAP
nanocores via charge adsorption. The TfR-A aptamer was in-
serted into erythrocyte membrane vesicles (RBCm) to form the
T-R shell structure. Finally, TR was used to encapsulate the
ZC/RNAi/AAP nanocore and form TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP by ultra-
sound (Figure 1a). Afterward, changes in the morphology, size,
and zeta potential of these nanoparticles were measured. As
shown inFigure 2a, ZC exhibited 3D and quadrate crystal par-
ticleswhileZRAwasclosertothedispersedsphericalstructure,
whichmaybecausedbythemodiﬁcationofPEI,APP,andRNAi
on the surface of ZC. TR-ZRA was synthesized after ultrasonic
treatment and ﬁltration, and it can be seen that there was an
erythrocyte membrane structure (≈8n m )a r o u n dZ R A .M o r e -
over, the elemental mapping images of TR-ZRA showed the co-
localization of Zn, the characteristic element of nanoparticles,
in the elements (P and S) of RBCm, which also conﬁrmed that
ZRA was encapsulated by RBCm (Figure 2b). As shown in Fig-
ure 2c, the sizes of the ZC, ZRA, RBCm, and TR-ZRA particles
measured by TEM were≈37.5, 60.1, 84.0, and 93.3 nm, respec-
tively. In addition, as shown in Figure 2d, the zeta potentials of
ZCandZC-PEIwere −14.9and13.6mV,respectively.Aftercoin-

These results showed that the PEI modiﬁcation of ZC caused a

fully attached to ZRA to synthesize TR-ZRA. In addition, a gel

indicating that the ZC nanoparticles had good biological safety,

system. We incubated mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages with
ZC, ZC, and TR-ZC. As shown in Figure 3e,f, we found that
R-ZC and TR-ZC can evade phagocytosis by immune cells due
to camouﬂaging by the erythrocyte membrane. It is possible
that erythrocyte membrane proteins, such as CD47, mediated
thelong-termcirculationofthenanoparticlesintheexperiment
by interacting with phagocytic receptors to escape phagocytic
cells.[30,31] Therefore, more nanoparticles had the opportunity
to cross the BBB. In our system, CD22 shRNA, aptamers, and
RBCswereendogenousmaterials,andZCwasalsosafe,soTR-
ZRA had little eﬀect on nerve cells, highlighting the advantages
of this system as a therapeutic agent for AD therapy. Therefore,
the biocompatibility of these nanoparticles in vitro conﬁrmed

2.4.AnticomplementActivityofNanoparticlesandA 𝜷 Detection
byA𝜷 Aptamer
The complement system is a double-edged sword that is neuro-
protective but can also be neurotoxic, depending on its starting
target and activation level.[33] It has been reported that the lev-
els of C1q, C3, C4, and other complement components in the
brainsofratswithADarehigher,andthesecomponentslargely
colocalize with A𝛽 plaques in the brain, especially in the hip-
pocampusandcortex,suggestingthatthesecomplementcompo-
nents may be related to neurodegeneration caused by neuroin-
ﬂammation and synapse loss in the brain.[11] As designed, ZC

ticomplementactivity.ThechlorogenicacidofZCboundtopro-
teins through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding

centhemolyticinhibitionthroughtheclassicalpathway(CH50)
was used to evaluate the anticomplement activities. Guinea pig
serum(complement)wasdilutedto1:10,1:20,1:40,1:80,1:160,
and 1:320 with PBS and added to the hemolysis system to eval-
uate titers. As shown inFigure 5a, the hemolysis rate was close
to 100% when the dilution of complement was 1:10–1:20, and
the system achieved complete hemolysis. Guinea pig serum di-
luted 1:20 was selected to ensure complete hemolysis and im-
provethesensitivityofthesystem.AsshowninFigure5b,inthe
anticomplement assays, compared with the 1:20 diluted guinea
pigserumgroupandthepositivecontrol,theZC,R-ZC,andTR-
ZC groups all displayed much lower hemolysis capacities, with
values of 3.25%, 3.42%, and 2.99%, respectively. These results
demonstrated that these treatments all possessed strong anti-
complementactivity,andtheircomplementinhibitionrateswere
upto96.4%,96.6%,and96.8%,respectively.Thisresultsigniﬁed
thattheredcellmembranecoatingonthesurfaceoftheZCdid
notaﬀecttheanticomplementactivitiesoftheZC.Moreover,the
anticomplementcharacteristicsofZCwereveriﬁedinmicewith
AD. After nanodrug treatment for a month, Western blot (WB)
assay showed that the content of complement components (C3,
C4b,C1q)inthebraintissueofTR-ZRAtreatedgroupwasinhib-
ited(Figure5candFigureS8,SupportingInformation).Besides,
asshowninFigure5d,eandFigureS9a,SupportingInformation,
the red ﬂuorescence representing the level of complement C1q
aroundastrocytes(redﬂuorescence)wassigniﬁcantlyreducedin
the TR-ZRA group but not in the ZC and ZRA groups. In addi-
tion, compared with that in the AD group, the ﬂuorescence in-
tensity of C3 and C4 was decreased in the TR-ZRA group but
the complement components of other experimental groups re-
mainedactivatedinthebrain,whichalsoreﬂectedtheinhibition
of complement activity to a certain extent (Figure S9b, Support-
ingInformation).Moreover,GFAP,theindicatorofactivatedas-
trocytes, was also reduced, which indicated that the inﬂamma-
tioninbrainwasrelievedtosomeextent(FigureS9c,Supporting
Information). These results were slightly inconsistent with the
in vitro results, which may be because TR-ZRA, which reached
thebrainmoreabundantlyundertheactionoftargetingfactors,
fully reduced complement activity. In short, these experimental
results indicated that the chlorogenic acid in the nanoparticles
can inhibit the overactivation of complement in the brain envi-
ronmentandprotectthenervoussystem.
Nucleic acid aptamers, which are oligonucleotides that have
high aﬃnities and speciﬁcities for their targets because of their
similarities as receptors, have received much attention.[35] It is
generally believed that these aptamers form secondary/tertiary
structuresthatprovidebindingopportunitiesfortheirtargets. [36]
In our design, the aptamer was folded into a secondary hairpin
structure. In the absence of A𝛽1-42, ﬂuorescence was quenched
when the FAM group labeling the 3′ end was close to the BHQ
grouplabelingthe5 ′ end.TheaptamercouldbindtoA 𝛽1-42 when
A𝛽1-42 was present. FAM and BHQ then moved far away from
eachother,andthegreenﬂuorescencewasrestored( Figure 6a).
As shown in Figure 6b, after optimizing the experimental con-
ditions, the relationship between the ﬂuorescence intensity of
AAP and the concentration of A𝛽1-42 was analyzed. The results
showed that the ﬂuorescence signal of AAP increased gradually
with increasing A𝛽1-42 concentration, which indicated that AAP

2.5.CD22DownregulationinMicrogliaandDegradationof
InﬂammatoryFactors
After simulating the BBB transport of the nanoparticles, we de-
signed mCherry−CD22shRNA to reduce CD22 expression in BV2
cell. We chose the commercial reagent Lipo8000 as the control.
As can be seen fromFigure 7a and Figure S11, Supporting In-
formation, the transfection eﬃciency of TR-ZRA was more ex-
cellent in BV2 and the mean ﬂuorescence intensity of the TR-
ZRA group was≈1.56 times that of the ZRA group, which may
be due to the action of targeting factors and erythrocytes mem-
brane. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in plasmid delivery
in normal and aging microglia (Figure S12, Supporting Infor-
mation). Next, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were employed
to detect the expression of CD22 to determine the silencing ef-
ﬁcacy of the nanoparticles. After treatment with A𝛽1-42, the ex-
pressionofCD22inBV2cellswaselevated.Comparedwithother

indicating regulatory activity of delivered CD22shRNA. Among
them, TR-ZRA combined with targeting factors and erythrocyte

cenceassay,CD22expression(green)wassigniﬁcantlydownreg-
ulated in IBA1-labeled microglia (red) after TR-ZRA treatment
(Figure 7g). These results all demonstrated the higher silencing
eﬃciency of TR-ZRA, which can probably be attributed to TfR-
A’s targetability and eﬃcient transport of ZC. What’s more, the
activity of HT22 cells incubating with TR-ZRA was investigated
byLive/deadstaining.AsshowninFigureS13,SupportingInfor-

Moreover, A𝛽1-42 can continuously stimulate microglial toxic-
ityunderthepathologicalconditionofAD,resultinginthedeath
of microglia and increased levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines,
suchasIL-1 𝛽,IL-6,andTNF- 𝛼,inthebrain.Theseproinﬂamma-
toryfactorsinturntriggerandexacerbateA 𝛽 aggregation,form-
ingaviciouscycleduringthepathologicalprocessandultimately
exacerbating AD.[37,38] Therefore, the levels of proinﬂammatory
cytokines in BV2 cells were evaluated by Western blotting. As
shown inFigure 8a,b, we proved that the levels of IL-1𝛽,T N F -
𝛼,andIL-6wereobviouslyincreasedwhenBV2cellswerecocul-
tured with A𝛽1-42 or the commercial transfection reagent Lipo,
which might be associated with the toxicity caused by A𝛽1-42 or
Lipo. The levels of these proinﬂammatory cytokines remained
relatively high after ZC treatment alone, which might be due to
thecorrelationbetweencellularuptakeofthedrugandthelevel
ofintracellulargeneexpressioninagingBV2cells.Nevertheless,
thelevelsoftheseproinﬂammatorycytokinesweredecreasedin
theZRA-andTR-ZRA-treatedgroups,whichmightberelatedto
theCD22levelinBV2cells. [39] Inparticular,decreasedCD22lev-
els could facilitate microglial status and promote phagocytosis
of A𝛽, which would further reduce inﬂammation levels. In ad-
dition,animmunoﬂuorescenceassaywasadoptedtodetecttyp-
ical proinﬂammatory factors, including IL-1𝛽,T N F -𝛼, and IL-6
(green), in the cortex and hippocampus (Figure 8c and Figure
S14, Supporting Information). The results showed that the lev-
elsofthesecytokinesweresigniﬁcantlyreduced,conﬁrmingthe
anti-inﬂammatoryactivityoftheTR-ZRAnanosystem.Neuroin-
ﬂammation is mediated not only by the activation of glial cells
(suchasmicroglia)andtheproductionofcytokines,chemokines,
and ROS but also by the complement system. A𝛽 activates the
NF-𝜅B pathway, leading to increased release of C3, which can
bind to C3aR on neurons and microglia, activate microglia, and
induce the release of proinﬂammatory cytokines.[40] C1q bind-
ing to A𝛽 and tau proteins in the AD brain can also cause com-
plementactivation,whichleadstoneuroinﬂammationandneu-
rodegeneration in AD patients.[41,42] Thus, complement levels

2.6.A𝜷 DegradationandIncreasedNeuronalActivity
Microglia, a crucial line of immune defense in the central ner-
vous system, play an important role in maintaining immune
homeostasis in the brain. In the AD brain, activated microglia
have an impaired ability to phagocytose A𝛽, resulting in A𝛽 ac-
cumulation and further intensifying brain inﬂammation.[43,44]
Therefore,A𝛽 degradationinBV-2cellsiscrucialtoimprovethe
AD environment. To simulate the AD environment, BV2 cells
were incubated with A𝛽1-42 for 12 h to induce an inﬂammatory
state.Toinvestigatetheeﬀectofnanoparticlesonthephagocyto-
sisofA 𝛽 byBV2cells,FITC-A 𝛽1-42 wasco-incubatedwithproin-
ﬂammatorymicroglialcellsintheabsenceorpresenceofdiﬀer-
ent preparations, including ZC, ZRA, and TR-ZRA. After 6 h,
colocalizationoftheFITC-A 𝛽1-42 oligomerwithendo/lysosomes
wasobservedbyCLSM.Endo/lysosomesarethemainorganelles
of A𝛽 degradation in microglia. As shown inFigure 9aa n d
Figure S15, Supporting Information, FITC-A𝛽1-42 oligomer and
endo/lysosomeweremostlycolocalizedasyellowspotsintheTR-
ZRA group, indicating that the phagocytosis of A𝛽1-42 by BV2
cells was enhanced in the presence of CD22 shRNA, while ZC
alonedidnotsigniﬁcantlyimprovethephagocytosiseﬀect,which
was consistent with the hypothesis that the inhibition of CD22
in microglia promotes the elimination of A𝛽 by microglia. A
consistent trend was observed in the brain tissue of AD mice.
To observe the capture and degradation of A𝛽 by microglia in
vivo, microglia and A𝛽 labeled with an anti-IBA1 antibody and
anti-A𝛽 antibody, respectively, were analyzed by immunoﬂuo-
rescence.ComparedwithobservationsinWTmice,aggregation
of the A𝛽 green ﬂuorescence signal was obviously observed in
AD mice suggesting microglial dysfunction of A𝛽 phagocytosis
in AD mice (Figure 9b and Figure S16a, Supporting Informa-
tion). In addition, in ZC- and ZRA-treated AD mice, a mass of
A𝛽 plaquesandactivatedmicrogliawerebothobserved,indicat-
ingthatthesenanoparticlescouldnotreachthebraineﬃciently
enough to encourage microglia to phagocytose A𝛽. However, in
the TR-ZRA groups, only a few A𝛽 plaques were observed, and
the area of activated microglia decreased in the brain (Figure
S16b,c, Supporting Information). These phenomena suggested
thataftertreatmentwithnanoparticles,theexpressionofCD22in
microgliawasdownregulated,whichcouldenhancethedysfunc-
tionofhealthymicroglia,alleviateactivatedmicroglialinﬁltration
andpromotephagocytosisofA 𝛽 inthebraintissueofADmice.
Inconclusion,TR-ZRA,comparedwiththeothertreatments,sig-
niﬁcantly ameliorated A𝛽 clearance and microglial dysfunction
inthebraintissue.
It is generally considered that aggregated A𝛽1-42 can lead to
cytotoxicity.[45] It has been proven that TR-ZRA can downregu-
late CD22 in microglia, which could improve the ability of BV2
cellstophagocytoseA 𝛽 andreducethetoxicityofA 𝛽 toneurons.
We performed live/dead staining to investigate the eﬀect of the
nanoparticlesonA 𝛽-inducedcytotoxicity.BV2cellsweretreated
with A𝛽 1-42 in the absence or presence of nanoparticles. After
24–48 h, the culture medium of BV2 cells was removed and in-
cubatedwithHT22cellsfor24htoevaluatecellactivity.Asshown
inFigure9candFigureS17,SupportingInformation,therewere
anumberofdeadcellsafterincubationwithA 𝛽1-42 alonefor24h.
Inaddition,freeZCorCD22shRNAhadlittleeﬀectduetotheir
poor cellular uptake and A𝛽 clearance. Nevertheless, the num-
berofdeadcellsdecreasedsigniﬁcantlyaftertreatmentwithTR-
ZRA medium, which means that the cells’ functions had been
improved. This indicated that the TR-ZRA nanoparticles could
reduce A𝛽-induced cytotoxicity and promote cell proliferation.
Similarly,bothHEstainingandNisslstainingshowedimprove-
ments in neuron health after TR-ZRA treatment. As shown in
Figure 9d, the nucleoli became clearer, the cells were arranged
neatly, and the intracellular Nissl bodies were more abundant,
indicatingthattheneuronswererepairedeﬀectively.
2.7.Biodistribution,MagneticResonanceImaging,and
ImprovedMemoryCapabilityInVivo
To evaluate the therapeutic eﬀect of the nanoparticles in vivo,
6-month-old APP/PS1 mice were intravenously injected every 5
days for a month (Figure 10a). To observe the distribution of
nanoparticlesinvivo,weinjectedCy5.5-labelednanoparticlesin-
travenously into mice. As expected, after intravenous adminis-
tration,ﬂuorescenceimagesshowedthatTR-ZRAgroupshowed
a strong ﬂuorescence signal in the brain tissue in vivo 72 h af-
ter injection (Figure 10b). Besides, we observed the circulation
of RhB labeled nanoparticles in mice. As shown in the Figure
S18, Supporting Information, free ZC was rapidly cleared from
the mouse after injection through the tail vein with a brief half-
life. In contrast, for R-ZC, a signiﬁcant increase in half-life was
observed. It should also be noted that the amount of nanopar-
ticles in the TR-ZC group also showed a rapid decrease in the
amount of circulating in vivo with the shorter half-life, but the
amount in vivo was still relatively higher than that of free ZC.
This result may be related to the loading of targeted factors on
thenanoparticlesaftercoating,whichmademostofthenanopar-
ticles concentrate in the brain. This is mainly attributed to the
TfR-A aptamer and erythrocyte membrane modiﬁcation on the
nanoparticles, which helped TR-ZRA target endothelial cells in

region volume was observed in AD mice (17.985 mm3) relative
to healthy WT mice (21.8 mm3), which was consistent with
previous reports.[46,47] However, after TR-ZRA treatment for a
month,therewasaslightupwardtrendinhippocampalvolume
(18.29 mm3), which might also be related to the amount of
drug reaching the brain and the duration of treatment. This
demonstratedthattherapeuticcomponents,suchaschlorogenic
acid and RNAi, have the potential to protect neurons, alleviate
neuroinﬂammationandremovemoreA 𝛽.
On the other hand, the Morris water maze (MWM) experi-
ment is an experiment in which mice are forced to swim and
learn to ﬁnd hidden platforms in the water. It is mainly used to
test experimental animals’ learning and memory ability in the
context of sensing spatial position and direction. Therefore, the
MWM experiment was employed to compare the spatial learn-
ing and memory abilities of the mice after a month of treat-
ment.AsshowninFigure10g,thetypicalswimmingtrackroute
andthenumberoftargetplatformpassesineachgroupofmice
were recorded. On the test day, the platform was removed, and
AD mice treated with PBS had severe memory deﬁcits and dis-
played no signiﬁcant improvement after 5 days of spatial learn-
ing (Figure S19, Supporting Information). However, AD mice
treated with TR-ZRA displayed substantially shorter escape la-
tenciestotarget,witha58.7%decreasecomparedwiththePBS-
treatedgroup(Figure10h).Inaddition,comparedwiththeother
groups,theTR-ZRAgroupcrossedtheplatformmoretimes(1.7
times)andspentmoretime(22.1%)inthetargetquadrant(Fig-
ure10i,j).ThesebehavioralexperimentalresultsindicatethatTR-
ZRAcouldalleviatememoryimpairmentinADmicetoacertain
extent. Moreover, when all treatments were ﬁnished, the major
organs of the mice were analyzed by HE staining (Figure S20,
Supporting Information). The nanoparticles did not cause any
pathologic changes in the major organs in these mice, indicat-
ing clear biocompatibility in vivo after 4 weeks of treatment via
intravenousinjection.
3.Conclusion
In conclusion, the BBB-penetrating nanodrug system described
here regulates the brain immune microenvironment in AD by
enhancing microglial phagocytosis and inhibiting complement
activation. It was found that TR-ZRA is a nanoscale agent and
has satisfactory biosafety for cells, the blood‒brain barrier, and
various tissues and organs in in vivo and in vitro experiments.
Thechlorogenicacidcarriedbythenanosystemwasconﬁrmedto
havetheabilitytomodulatecomplementlevelsinthebrainenvi-
ronmentinAD,whichwasimportantforalleviatingimmunein-
ﬂammatorydamage.Inaddition,TR-ZRAregulatesCD22levels
in cells by delivering CD22 shRNA, which promotes microglial
phagocytosisofA 𝛽,reducestheA 𝛽 burdenincellsandADmice,
inhibits microglial neuroinﬂammation, and facilitates memory
capacity in AD mice. Thus, chlorogenic acid has synergistic ef-
fects with CD22 shRNA in regulating the immune microenvi-
ronment in the brain. In addition, the A𝛽 aptamer contained in
TR-ZRAwas shown tobeappropriate forin vitromonitoringof

toformanamidebondwithDSPE-PEG2000-NH 2.Then,DSPE-PEG2000-
NH2-TfR-A (0.1 mL) and erythrocyte membrane vesicles (0.9 mL) were
blended at 37°C for 6 h. TR was acquired by high-speed centrifugation
to eliminate dissociated molecules. Second, chlorogenic acid (0.8 g) and
ZnNO3 (0.1 g) were dissolved in 5 mL of double-distilled water. Chloro-
genic acid was added dropwise into the ZnNO3 and stirred magneti-
cally until the solution became milky white. The solution was then cen-
trifuged, washed three times with double-distilled water, and lyophilized
into a powder with a vacuum freeze dryer for subsequent application.
Third, ZC was resuspended in ultra-pure water and treated with ultra-
sound for 10 min. The PEI polymer was then added to the nanoparticle
solution and magnetically stirred overnight at room temperature to ob-
tain ZC-PEI nanoparticles, which were recovered by centrifugation (5000
× g, centrifugation at 25°C for 20 min) and cleaned multiple times with
ultra-pure water to remove the unlinked PEI.[49] CD22 shRNA and AAP
were mixed with ZC-PEI at diﬀerent ratios, and the ﬁnal volume of each
solutionwas20 μL.Thesolutionswereincubatedatroomtemperaturefor
30min.Agarosegelelectrophoresiswasperformedat120Vfor20minto
observe the binding ability at diﬀerent ratios of gene vector to plasmid.
Finally,ZC/RNAi/AAP(ZRA)wasconstructedaccordingtotheoptimalra-
tio. TR was ultrasonicated (42 kHz, 100 W) for 2 min with ZC/RNAi/AAP
mixturetoformTR-ZC/RNAi/AAP.
Characterization of Nanomaterials: The particle size distribution and
zetapotentialofthenanoparticlesweremeasuredusingaZeta-sizerNano
ZS (Malvern Nano, Malvern, U.K.). The size and shape of the nanoparti-
cles were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mem-
brane proteins of RBCm, TR, and TR-ZRA were obtained with RIPA ly-
sis buﬀer and quantiﬁed with a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, China).
Sodium dodecyl sulfate‒polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‒PAGE)
was used to identify erythrocyte membrane proteins. Gels were stained
withKomasBrilliantBluestainingreagent(Beyotime,China)andimaged
withagelimagingsystem(Bio-Rad,USA).
Cytotoxicity of the Nanoparticles: The cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles
to cells was determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions for

sity of 1× 104 cells per well. After 24 h, 10μL ZC, ZRA, and TR-ZRA at
diﬀerent concentrations (0–250μgm L−1) were added to each well, and
the cells were incubated for 24 h. After 24 h, each well received 100μL

Biocompatibility and Immune Escape Ability of the Nanoparticles: The
hemocompatibility of nanoparticles was investigated by a hemolysis as-
say. Diﬀerent concentrations (0–250μgm L−1)o fZ Ca n dT R - Z Cw e r ei n -
cubatedwith5%erythrocytesofmiceat37 °Cfor2h.Then,thecellswere

Primary Astrocyte Extraction: Primary astrocytes were isolated from
the brains of neonatal 7-day-old mice according to previously described
procedures.[50] 7-day-oldC57BL/6femalemiceweresacriﬁcedunderasep-
tic conditions, and the brain tissue was removed from the ultraclean ta-
ble into Hanks solution. The meninges and blood vessels were removed
with pointed forceps, and the intact cerebral cortex was minced, added
to trypsin, and then placed in a cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2)
for 10 min after being mixed thoroughly. The samples were removed and
mixed every 5 min until no obvious brain tissue clumps were observed.
After the addition of DMEM-F12 medium containing serum to terminate
the digestion, the samples were ﬁltered through a 0.44μms i e v ea n d
centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and
the pellet was resuspended in fresh complete medium, added to culture
dishes at a density of 1× 107 cells per well, and incubated at 37°Ca n d
5%CO2.Themediumwaschangedevery2days,and7–10dayslater,as-

Theextractedastrocyteswerefrozenforsubsequentexperiments.
Construction of an In Vitro Blood‒Brain Barrier Model and Penetration of
Nanoparticles: AninvitroBBBmodelwasgeneratedwithamicroporous
Transwell membrane (0.4μm) and cultured cells to investigate the ability
ofnanoparticlestopenetratetheBBB,asdescribedpreviously,withsome
modiﬁcations.[51] Speciﬁcally,theuppersideofthemembranewasinocu-
latedwithbEnd.3cells,andthelowersidewasinoculatedwithastrocytes.
Inaddition,BV2wereinoculatedinto6-wellplatestomoreaccuratelysim-
ulate the microenvironment in the brain. When the cell density reached
90% under the microscope, the model was considered to be established
successfully, and A𝛽1-42 was added for further incubation for 48 h to sim-
ulate thepathologicalconditionsof AD. ZC, Cy5.5-NH2 or RhodamineB-
PEG-NH2, EDC, and NHS were dissolved in deionized water (5 mL) and
stirredatroomtemperaturefor6h.Themixedsystemwascentrifuged(at

Aftertheadditionofnanoparticles,100 μLmediumwascollectedevery6h
from the upper and lower sides of the ﬁlter membrane, the ﬂuorescence
intensity was detected with a multifunctional microplate reader, and the
changes in ﬂuorescence intensity were recorded. The penetration ability
was evaluated by the ratio of ﬂuorescence intensity in upper and lower
culturemediumat24h.
After the experiment, the ﬁlter membrane was cut oﬀ with scissors,
and the cells on both sides of the membrane were washed three times
with PBS for 5 min each time and then ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde
atroomtemperaturefor15–30min.Then,0.5%Triton-100wasaddedfor

Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500) and FITC-labeled
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500) were incubated with bEnd.3
cells and astrocytes, respectively, for 1 h at 37°C in the dark, followed by
washing with PBS ﬁve times. Finally, the nuclei were stained with DAPI
(1:5000), and the cells were incubated for≈10–15 min at room tempera-
ture, washed with PBS, and then observed. Images were captured with a
laserconfocalﬂuorescencemicroscope.
Cellular Internalization of bEnd.3 and BV-2 Cells: A total of 1× 106
bEnd.3 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and cultured overnight at 37
°C. Then, Rh B-ZC, Rh B-R-ZC, and Rh B-TR-ZC (with ZC 40μgm L−1)
were co-incubated with bEnd.3 cells for 4 h. Next, the cells were washed

centration. The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, with a protein loading volume of 30μg, and transferred
to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes for blotting after electrophoresis.
The blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST at room temperature
for 1 h. Diﬀerent primary antibodies were added to the membranes sep-
arately and incubated overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with the
appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. The blots
were developed using ECL technology. GAPDH was used as an internal

 ","Titled ""A Novel Liposomal Nanocarrier for Targeted Delivery of Anti-Amyloid Beta Peptide Antibody to Mitigate Amyloid Plaque Accumulation and Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease Model"", this study introduces a liposomal nanocarrier designed to deliver an anti-amyloid beta peptide antibody, aiming to mitigate amyloid plaque accumulation and cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease. The nanocarrier is based on brain-specific ligands and utilizes a dual targeting strategy for enhanced efficacy. In vitro studies demonstrated the successful internalization of the nanocarriers by cultured neurons. Subsequently, in vivo experiments using an Alzheimer's disease mouse model showed significant reduction in amyloid plaque accumulation and alleviation of cognitive impairment compared to controls. The findings suggest that this targeted delivery system could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease treatment.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly population. Despite significant advances in studies of the pathobiology on AD, there is still no effective treatment. Here, an erythrocyte membrane-camouflaged nanodrug delivery system (TR-ZRA) modified with transferrin receptor aptamers that can be targeted across the blood–brain barrier to ameliorate AD immune environment is established. Based on metal-organic framework (Zn-CA), TR-ZRA is loaded with CD22shRNA plasmid to silence the abnormally high expression molecule CD22 in aging microglia. Most importantly, TR-ZRA can enhance the ability of microglia to phagocytose Aβ and alleviate complement activation, which can promote neuronal activity and decrease inflammation level in the AD brain. Moreover, TR-ZRA is also loaded with Aβ aptamers, which allow rapid and low-cost monitoring of Aβ plaques in vitro. After treatment with TR-ZRA, learning, and memory abilities are enhanced in AD mice. In conclusion, the biomimetic delivery nanosystem TR-ZRA in this study provides a promising strategy and novel immune targets for AD therapy.","1. Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is gradually becoming the leading cause of dementia worldwide, with the prevalence of AD gradually increasing from 5.0% in people aged 65–74 years to 33.2% in people aged 85 years and older, resulting in more than 52 million people being affected worldwide.[1] The pathogenesis of AD remains complex, but the most common explanation in recent studies is the amyloid cascade hypothesis. [2,3] The formation of Aβ plaques results from a series of amyloid peptides that are abnormally sheared. Excessive Aβ plaque accumulation could disrupt brain microvascular endothelial cells, impair the integrity of the blood‒brain barrier, and induce infiltration of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells from outside the brain, resulting in disorders of the immune microenvironment in the brain.[4,5] Therefore, remodeling the immune microenvironment and eliminating the accumulation of abnormal Aβ in the brain is one of the most important strategies for the treatment of AD. Microglia are macrophages in the brain and spinal cord, and they represent the primary line of immune defense in the central nervous system, as they are mainly responsible for clearing damaged neurons, Aβ plaques, and infectious substances in the central nervous system. [6] However, aging microglia in the brains of AD patients may become dysfunctional and metabolically impaired, and their ability to clear Aβ is reduced, which results in the formation of a large number of Aβ plaques.[7,8] On the other hand, microglia in the AD brain show excessive activation and an uncontrolled state, and they can release many proinflammatory factors (such as tumor necrosis factor TNF-α, interleukin IL-1β, IL-6, etc.) and complement components, further causing immune inflammatory damage. [9,10] At the same time, the membrane attack complex formed by complement activation can directly damage neurons that are highly sensitive to complement or stimulate microglia to release more inflammatory factors, forming a positive feedback loop to further aggravate immune inflammatory damage to neurons. [11] In addition, proinflammatory mediators decrease the expression of receptors capable of binding to Aβ on the surface of microglia, which decreases Aβ phagocytosis by microglia and further promotes the production and deposition of Aβ.[12] Therefore, modulating the immune response and enhancing microglial phagocytosis to promote clearance of Aβ while inhibiting complement to reduce immune inflammatory damage and synergistically protect neurons in the brain is a possible strategy to improve AD pathology. In previous research, CD22 was found to be highly expressed in aging microglia. [13] It was proposed that silencing CD22 might enhance Aβ clearance by microglia. Thus, an effective gene vector loaded with CD22 shRNA (RNAi) was designed to test this hypothesis. In addition, an Aβ aptamer (AAP), which can detect Aβ in the brain in real time, was designed to specifically bind to Aβ and indicate the content of Aβ via a fluorescence signal based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer effect. However, the negative charge of the nucleic acid hinders its entry into the cellular cytoplasm. Moreover, these naked nucleic acid molecules are easily digested by intracellular nucleases.[14] At present, the vectors for gene therapy mainly include viral vectors such as lentivirus, adenovirus, and adeno-associated virus and nonviral vectors such as cationic liposomes, but due to their drawback of immunogenicity, oncogenicity, high costs, and a single function, they are difficult to translate to the clinic, and their applications are limited. Notably, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline porous materials with periodic lattice structures that are formed via the self-assembly of transition metal ions and organic ligands; these structures have high porosity and a large specific surface area and can adsorb plasmid DNA via noncovalent forces such as electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding while protecting it from chemical and/or enzymatic degradation.[15,16] Chlorogenic acid (CA) is a phenolic acid extracted from honeysuckle that can be used as an organic ligand for the structure of metal-organic framework (MOF) CA has antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and complement activation inhibitory effects. [17] Therefore, our research aimed to synthesize a Zn-CA MOF by combining zinc ions (Zn2+) with CA for the efficient loading of CD22shRNA and Aβ aptamer. However, nanoparticles can be easily recognized and cleared as exogenous substances by the reticuloendothelial phagocytic system in the body.[18] Red blood cells (RBCs), the most abundant blood cells without nuclei in mammals, are the main medium for oxygen delivery, and their cell membranes are easy to prepare.[19,20] Moreover, the self-recognition molecule CD47 on the surface of erythrocytes endows the encapsulated nanoparticles with a long circulating half-life and immune evasion function.[21,22] In addition, receptor-mediated transcytosis is currently one of the most effective ways to mediate crossing of the blood‒brain barrier by biomolecules. [23] Transferrin receptor (TfR), one of the most representative transcytosis receptors, was distributed widely in endothelial cells, plexus epithelial cells, neurons, and common glial cell in brain tissue. In this study, inspired by most reports, a TfR aptamer was designed as a TfR ligand. [24] After binding to TfR, the nanosystem entered the blood–brain barrier through transcytosis of brain endothelial cells, and was then taken up by microglia, neurons, and other cells containing TfRs.[25,26] Thus, the resulting erythrocyte-camouflaged nanoparticles were expected to protect the whole system from degradation, and the TfR aptamer, which was attached to the surface of the erythrocyte membrane by lipid insertion, was predicted to improve the ability of the system to reach the blood‒brain barrier, both of which could play essential roles in enhancing efficacy. Hence, in this study, we proposed the use of Zn2+ and CA to construct a metal-organic framework Zn-CA (ZC), which simultaneously transports CD22 shRNA (RNAi) and Aβ aptamer (AAP) to form a ZC/RNAi/AAP (ZRA) nanocore. Finally, the TfR aptamer-RBCm (TR) shell structure encapsulates ZRA to form a novel erythrocyte membrane-camouflaged nanodrug system: TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP (TR-ZRA). As shown in Figure 1a,b, TR-ZRA was camouflaged by an autologous erythrocyte membrane and targeted to penetrate the blood‒brain barrier under the action of TfR aptamer. After phagocytosis and decomposition by microglia, ZC acts as an inhibitor of complement activation, and AAP indicates Aβ levels in the brain via fluorescence intensity. CD22shRNA inhibits the expression of CD22 in microglia at the gene level and promotes the phagocytic clearance of Aβ by microglia, which further reduces immune inflammatory damage in the brain and improves neuronal activity. Thus, TR-ZRA was designed to improve the immune environment of AD and provide a possible strategy to cure AD.","2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Preparation and Characterization of TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP The primary process of TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP included incubation of Zn2+ and CA to synthesize a metal−organic framework (with PEI, positive charge) and loading with RNAi and AAP (negative charge), which resulted in the formation of ZC/RNAi/AAP nanocores via charge adsorption. The TfR-A aptamer was inserted into erythrocyte membrane vesicles (RBCm) to form the T-R shell structure. Finally, TR was used to encapsulate the ZC/RNAi/AAP nanocore and form TR-ZC/RNAi/AAP by ultrasound (Figure 1a). Afterward, changes in the morphology, size, and zeta potential of these nanoparticles were measured. As shown in Figure 2a, ZC exhibited 3D and quadrate crystal particles while ZRA was closer to the dispersed spherical structure, which may be caused by the modification of PEI, APP, and RNAi on the surface of ZC. TR-ZRA was synthesized after ultrasonic treatment and filtration, and it can be seen that there was an erythrocyte membrane structure (≈8 nm) around ZRA. Moreover, the elemental mapping images of TR-ZRA showed the co-localization of Zn, the characteristic element of nanoparticles, in the elements (P and S) of RBCm, which also confirmed that ZRA was encapsulated by RBCm (Figure 2b). As shown in Figure 2c, the sizes of the ZC, ZRA, RBCm, and TR-ZRA particles measured by TEM were ≈37.5, 60.1, 84.0, and 93.3 nm, respectively. In addition, as shown in Figure 2d, the zeta potentials of ZC and ZC-PEI were −14.9 and 13.6 mV, respectively. After co-incubation with the cationic polymerizer polyethyleneimine (PEI), ZC carried a positive charge on its surface, with a larger size and improved dispersion (Figure S1, Supporting Information). These results showed that the PEI modification of ZC caused a slight influence on the size, morphology, and potential of ZC, which were attributed to the characteristic of PEI. [27] The dispersion of ZC was also improved because the positive charges repel each other, and this behavior can be employed to achieve binding of more nucleic acid molecules with negative charges to form ZRA.[28] The TR, ZRA, and TR-ZRA particles had values of −10.2, 3.05, and −4.0 mV, respectively (Figure 2d). It can be seen from the zeta potential changes of the particles that the plasmids and aptamers successfully combined with ZC, and TR was successfully attached to ZRA to synthesize TR-ZRA. In addition, a gel electrophoresis assay was adopted to evaluate the complexation ability of CD22shRNA and Aβ aptamer. As shown in Figure 2e, ZC-AAP formation was limited to the initial gum hole when each micromole of AAP could combine with 0.27 μg or more ZC (the ratio was ≈4:15). In the same way, there was no free AAP or CD22shRNA at the bottom of the gel when 1 μg CD22shRNA was carried by 8 μg ZC-AAP (with a surface-mass ratio of 8:1) (Figure 2f). These results confirmed that ZRA could be synthesized step by step with the above proportions for subsequent experiments. Moreover, as shown in the UV−vis spectrum (Figure S2, Supporting Information), TR-ZRA had absorption peaks at 280 and 405 nm, consistent with the characteristic absorption peaks of RNAi, AAP, and TR, respectively. SDS‒PAGE (Figure S3, Supporting Information) showed that TR-ZRA possessed a protein profile similar to that of the erythrocyte membrane. DSPE-PEG-TfR-A-FAM was employed to prove that the targeting molecule TfR-A could voluntarily insert into the surface of the erythrocyte membrane. As shown in Figure S4a, Supporting Information, green fluorescence was apparent on the surface of the erythrocyte membrane, which confirmed inlaying of the targeted probe TfR-A onto the surface of the erythrocyte membrane via lipid insertion. And in Figure S4b, Supporting Information, it was observed that most of the erythrocyte membrane with green fluorescence was co-located with RhB-nanoparticles. Therefore, the obtained nanoparticles might exhibit the characteristics of immune escape and a long circulation period, which would increase the chances of passage through the BBB. [29] 2.2. Biocompatibility of the Nanoparticles The biosafety of nanoparticles is vital for future applications. The cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was evaluated by a standard Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay. The nanoparticles were incubated with various types of cells, including mouse brain endothelioma cells (bEnd.3), HT22 cells, and BV-2 cells. After 24 h of incubation, all these cells retained >80% viability with different nanoparticles at concentrations from 0 to 125 μg mL−1 (Figure 3a–c). In addition, we incubated RBCs from mice with different concentrations of ZC and TR-ZC (0–250 μg mL−1) for 2 h at 37 °C to evaluate the safety of the nanoparticles in the blood circulation. As shown in Figure 3d, no significant hemolysis (less than 2%) was observed after incubation of ZC or TR-ZC with RBC suspension. In addition, when ZC was coated with RBC membrane, the degree of hemolysis was further reduced, indicating that the ZC nanoparticles had good biological safety, and the erythrocyte membrane provided a further guarantee of the function of the nanoparticles in the blood circulation. Nanodrugs safely reach the target site and avoid being degraded by the immune system, which is one of the challenges for the effective delivery of nanomedicines to the central nervous system. We incubated mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages with ZC, ZC, and TR-ZC. As shown in Figure 3e,f, we found that R-ZC and TR-ZC can evade phagocytosis by immune cells due to camouflaging by the erythrocyte membrane. It is possible that erythrocyte membrane proteins, such as CD47, mediated the long-term circulation of the nanoparticles in the experiment by interacting with phagocytic receptors to escape phagocytic cells.[30,31] Therefore, more nanoparticles had the opportunity to cross the BBB. In our system, CD22shRNA, aptamers, and RBCs were endogenous materials, and ZC was also safe, so TR-ZRA had little effect on nerve cells, highlighting the advantages of this system as a therapeutic agent for AD therapy. Therefore, the biocompatibility of these nanoparticles in vitro confirmed their suitability for additional in vitro and in vivo experiments. 2.3. Establishment of Blood‒Brain Barrier and Penetration of Nanoparticles In Vitro The blood‒brain barrier (BBB) contributes substantially to maintaining the stability of the internal environment around the brain tissue and preventing harmful substances from entering the brain tissue. The tight junctions established between endothelial cells limit the passage of many neurotherapeutic drugs across the BBB.[32] In addition, the size, lipid solubility, and other physical and chemical properties of a drug also limit its ability to cross the BBB. Therefore, we next explored whether these synthetic nanoparticles could cross the blood‒brain barrier, which was simulated with a Transwell model in vitro. bEnd.3 and astrocyte cells were seeded in the upper and lower chambers, and BV2 was seeded in the bottom wells to simulate the BBB (Figure 4a). After 12–24 h of inoculation, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to verify the construction of the BBB model in vitro. As shown in Figure 4b, bEnd.3 and astrocyte cells were labeled with Cy3 and FITC, respectively, and their confluence was 90% on both sides of the insert, which was considered to indicate successful BBB construction. How to allow medicines with therapeutic effects within the central nervous system to transfer across the blood‒brain barrier (BBB) remains a challenge. Cerebral microvascular endothelial cells are regarded as some of the most important parts of the blood‒brain barrier, and they limit the flow of soluble substances and cells from the blood into the brain. The abundant expression of TfRs on most nerve cells made it possible for nanomaterials to cross the blood–brain barrier (Figure S5, Supporting Information). With the help of TfR aptamer, a large number of nanoparticles could be selectively transported into the brain environment via nanoparticle-specific targeting mediated by the TfR on bEnd.3 cells. Therefore, RhB-labeled nanoparticles were incubated with bEnd.3 cells for 2 and 6 h, and the localization of nanoparticles in the cells was observed by CLSM. As shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information, the cellular uptake of TR-ZC was much greater than that of ZC and R-ZC, which also indicated that TfR-A could enhance targeted cellular uptake. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 4c, after 2 h of incubation the red fluorescence of RhB-nanoparticles mainly colocalized with the green fluorescence of endo/lysosomes as yellow spots in these groups. However, after incubation for 6 h, most of the red signals separated from the green signals in the TR-ZC group, indicating that the nanoparticles had escaped from lysosomes. In contrast, the signals in the ZC and R-ZC groups were still located in endosomes/lysosomes after 6 h of incubation. The overlap coefficient results were shown in Figure 4d. These results indicated that TfR aptamer-TfR-mediated trans endocytosis could be an effective drug-specific delivery pathway that facilitates endo/lysosome escape and makes it possible for more nanoparticles to cross the blood‒brain barrier and be taken by microglial cells. Therefore, after establishment of the BBB model, Cy5.5-labeled nanoparticles were added to the upper culture medium to test their penetration. Specifically, the fluorescence intensity of equal quantities of different nanoparticles in the lower medium reflects their ability to cross the blood‒brain barrier in vitro (Figure S7, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 4e, free ZC showed minimal intensity due to its lack of lipid solubility and poor BBB penetration. Upon coating with RBCm, however, the transport of ZC was slightly enhanced. Notably, the best BBB penetration efficacy was observed for TR-ZRA due to the surface TfR aptamer modification that facilitated cell transportation via binding with TfR on bEnd.3 cells. The penetration in TR-ZC was only slightly enhanced, which may be attributed to the short total observation time and the stationary superior culture medium in the in vitro blood–brain barrier model. Generally, these results suggested that TR-ZRA can escape from bEnd.3 cells and efficiently cross the blood‒brain barrier, enabling further endocytosis by BV2 cells and regulation of microglial dysfunction. 2.4. Anticomplement Activity of Nanoparticles and Aβ Detection by Aβ Aptamer The complement system is a double-edged sword that is neuroprotective but can also be neurotoxic, depending on its starting target and activation level.[33] It has been reported that the levels of C1q, C3, C4, and other complement components in the brains of rats with AD are higher, and these components largely colocalize with Aβ plaques in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and cortex, suggesting that these complement components may be related to neurodegeneration caused by neuroinflammation and synapse loss in the brain.[11] As designed, ZC not only can be used as a drug transport carrier but also has anticomplement activity. The chlorogenic acid of ZC bound to proteins through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding and played a role in inhibiting complement activity. [34] Fifty percent hemolytic inhibition through the classical pathway (CH50) was used to evaluate the anticomplement activities. Guinea pig serum (complement) was diluted to 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320 with PBS and added to the hemolysis system to evaluate titers. As shown in Figure 5a, the hemolysis rate was close to 100% when the dilution of complement was 1:10–1:20, and the system achieved complete hemolysis. Guinea pig serum diluted 1:20 was selected to ensure complete hemolysis and improve the sensitivity of the system. As shown in Figure 5b, in the anticomplement assays, compared with the 1:20 diluted guinea pig serum group and the positive control, the ZC, R-ZC, and TR-ZC groups all displayed much lower hemolysis capacities, with values of 3.25%, 3.42%, and 2.99%, respectively. These results demonstrated that these treatments all possessed strong anticomplement activity, and their complement inhibition rates were up to 96.4%, 96.6%, and 96.8%, respectively. This result signified that the red cell membrane coating on the surface of the ZC did not affect the anticomplement activities of the ZC. Moreover, the anticomplement characteristics of ZC were verified in mice with AD. After nanodrug treatment for a month, Western blot (WB) assay showed that the content of complement components (C3, C4b, C1q) in the brain tissue of TR-ZRA treated group was inhibited (Figure 5c and Figure S8, Supporting Information). Besides, as shown in Figure 5d,e and Figure S9a, Supporting Information, the red fluorescence representing the level of complement C1q around astrocytes (red fluorescence) was significantly reduced in the TR-ZRA group but not in the ZC and ZRA groups. In addition, compared with that in the AD group, the fluorescence intensity of C3 and C4 was decreased in the TR-ZRA group but the complement components of other experimental groups remained activated in the brain, which also reflected the inhibition of complement activity to a certain extent (Figure S9b, Supporting Information). Moreover, GFAP, the indicator of activated astrocytes, was also reduced, which indicated that the inflammation in brain was relieved to some extent (Figure S9c, Supporting Information). These results were slightly inconsistent with the in vitro results, which may be because TR-ZRA, which reached the brain more abundantly under the action of targeting factors, fully reduced complement activity. In short, these experimental results indicated that the chlorogenic acid in the nanoparticles can inhibit the overactivation of complement in the brain environment and protect the nervous system. Nucleic acid aptamers, which are oligonucleotides that have high affinities and specificities for their targets because of their similarities as receptors, have received much attention.[35] It is generally believed that these aptamers form secondary/tertiary structures that provide binding opportunities for their targets. [36] In our design, the aptamer was folded into a secondary hairpin structure. In the absence of Aβ1-42, fluorescence was quenched when the FAM group labeling the 3′ end was close to the BHQ group labeling the 5′ end. The aptamer could bind to Aβ1-42 when Aβ1-42 was present. FAM and BHQ then moved far away from each other, and the green fluorescence was restored (Figure 6a). As shown in Figure 6b, after optimizing the experimental conditions, the relationship between the fluorescence intensity of AAP and the concentration of Aβ1-42 was analyzed. The results showed that the fluorescence signal of AAP increased gradually with increasing Aβ1-42 concentration, which indicated that AAP can indicate the Aβ1-42 concentration in vitro under certain conditions (Figure S10a, Supporting Information). In addition, the same concentrations of Aβ1-42 and BSA were incubated with different concentrations of AAP (0–160 μg mL−1) for 2 h at 37 °C to explore the reactivity of AAP (Figure 6c). Meanwhile, as shown in the Figure S10b, Supporting Information, different Aβ aggregates (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-20) were respectively co-incubated with aptamers at 37 °C for 2 h. The fluorescence intensity detected in Aβ1-42 group was significantly higher than that in the other two groups, indicating that the designed fluorescence aptamers had strong specificity and could bind to the protein sequence of Aβ1-42 for fluorescence recovery. As shown in Figure S10c, Supporting Information, the fluorescence intensity of AAP was both stable in the TBE and 10% FBS, which showed that the fluorescence intensity changed little within 24 h. AAP could also be used to monitor Aβ plaques in brain slices in vitro. We incubated 10 μM AAP with brain sections for 2 h at 37 °C and then observed the localization of Aβ on the brain sections under a fluorescence microscope. As shown in Figure 6d, AAP could specifically bind to Aβ plaques in brain slices from APP/PS1 mice and emit specific green fluorescence. Besides, the fluorescence image of AAP in the mice brain of TR-ZRA group was observed directly, which showed a little obvious green signal compared with AD-PBS group (Figure S10d, Supporting Information). Thus, these results indicated that this assay possesses the advantages of being economical and convenient and provides a new approach for monitoring Aβ in brain tissue in vitro. 2.5. CD22 Downregulation in Microglia and Degradation of Inflammatory Factors After simulating the BBB transport of the nanoparticles, we designed mCherry−CD22shRNA to reduce CD22 expression in BV2 cell. We chose the commercial reagent Lipo8000 as the control. As can be seen from Figure 7a and Figure S11, Supporting Information, the transfection efficiency of TR-ZRA was more excellent in BV2 and the mean fluorescence intensity of the TR-ZRA group was ≈1.56 times that of the ZRA group, which may be due to the action of targeting factors and erythrocytes membrane. There was no significant difference in plasmid delivery in normal and aging microglia (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Next, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were employed to detect the expression of CD22 to determine the silencing efficacy of the nanoparticles. After treatment with Aβ1-42, the expression of CD22 in BV2 cells was elevated. Compared with other groups, TR-ZRA groups showed significant inhibition of CD22, indicating regulatory activity of delivered CD22shRNA. Among them, TR-ZRA combined with targeting factors and erythrocyte membrane achieved higher delivery efficiency and thus had the strongest inhibitory effect on mRNA (Figure 7b) and protein expression of CD22 in BV2 cells (Figure 7c,d). CD22 silencing by the nanoparticles was also demonstrated in mice. After 1 month of treatment, the brain tissue of mice was employed for WB and immunofluorescence assays. The WB results showed that the expression of CD22 in the AD-TR-ZRA group was significantly lower than that in the AD group, indicating that CD22shRNA loaded with ZC effectively inhibited gene expression (Figure 7e,f). In addition, as observed in the immunofluorescence assay, CD22 expression (green) was significantly downregulated in IBA1-labeled microglia (red) after TR-ZRA treatment (Figure 7g). These results all demonstrated the higher silencing efficiency of TR-ZRA, which can probably be attributed to TfR-A’s targetability and efficient transport of ZC. What’s more, the activity of HT22 cells incubating with TR-ZRA was investigated by Live/dead staining. As shown in Figure S13, Supporting Information, there was no significant difference in the fluorescence intensity of dead cells between the PBS and TR-ZRA groups. These results indicate that CD22 silencing does not affect neuronal activity. These results indicate that CD22 silencing could not affect neuronal activity. Moreover, Aβ1-42 can continuously stimulate microglial toxicity under the pathological condition of AD, resulting in the death of microglia and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, in the brain. These proinflammatory factors in turn trigger and exacerbate Aβ aggregation, forming a vicious cycle during the pathological process and ultimately exacerbating AD.[37,38] Therefore, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in BV2 cells were evaluated by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 8a,b, we proved that the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were obviously increased when BV2 cells were cocultured with Aβ1-42 or the commercial transfection reagent Lipo, which might be associated with the toxicity caused by Aβ1-42 or Lipo. The levels of these proinflammatory cytokines remained relatively high after ZC treatment alone, which might be due to the correlation between cellular uptake of the drug and the level of intracellular gene expression in aging BV2 cells. Nevertheless, the levels of these proinflammatory cytokines were decreased in the ZRA- and TR-ZRA-treated groups, which might be related to the CD22 level in BV2 cells. [39] In particular, decreased CD22 levels could facilitate microglial status and promote phagocytosis of Aβ, which would further reduce inflammation levels. In addition, an immunofluorescence assay was adopted to detect typical proinflammatory factors, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 (green), in the cortex and hippocampus (Figure 8c and Figure S14, Supporting Information). The results showed that the levels of these cytokines were significantly reduced, confirming the anti-inflammatory activity of the TR-ZRA nanosystem. Neuroinflammation is mediated not only by the activation of glial cells (such as microglia) and the production of cytokines, chemokines, and ROS but also by the complement system. Aβ activates the NF-κB pathway, leading to increased release of C3, which can bind to C3aR on neurons and microglia, activate microglia, and induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines.[40] C1q binding to Aβ and tau proteins in the AD brain can also cause complement activation, which leads to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD patients.[41,42] Thus, complement levels may decrease, and the associated neuroinflammation may also be relieved after TR-ZRA treatment. Hence, the inflammatory environment in the AD brain was alleviated after TR-ZRA treatment. 2.6. Aβ Degradation and Increased Neuronal Activity Microglia, a crucial line of immune defense in the central nervous system, play an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis in the brain. In the AD brain, activated microglia have an impaired ability to phagocytose Aβ, resulting in Aβ accumulation and further intensifying brain inflammation.[43,44] Therefore, Aβ degradation in BV-2 cells is crucial to improve the AD environment. To simulate the AD environment, BV2 cells were incubated with Aβ1-42 for 12 h to induce an inflammatory state. To investigate the effect of nanoparticles on the phagocytosis of Aβ by BV2 cells, FITC-Aβ1-42 was co-incubated with proinflammatory microglial cells in the absence or presence of different preparations, including ZC, ZRA, and TR-ZRA. After 6 h, colocalization of the FITC-Aβ1-42 oligomer with endo/lysosomes was observed by CLSM. Endo/lysosomes are the main organelles of Aβ degradation in microglia. As shown in Figure 9a and Figure S15, Supporting Information, FITC-Aβ1-42 oligomer and endo/lysosome were mostly colocalized as yellow spots in the TR-ZRA group, indicating that the phagocytosis of Aβ1-42 by BV2 cells was enhanced in the presence of CD22shRNA, while ZC alone did not significantly improve the phagocytosis effect, which was consistent with the hypothesis that the inhibition of CD22 in microglia promotes the elimination of Aβ by microglia. A consistent trend was observed in the brain tissue of AD mice. To observe the capture and degradation of Aβ by microglia in vivo, microglia and Aβ labeled with an anti-IBA1 antibody and anti-Aβ antibody, respectively, were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Compared with observations in WT mice, aggregation of the Aβ green fluorescence signal was obviously observed in AD mice suggesting microglial dysfunction of Aβ phagocytosis in AD mice (Figure 9b and Figure S16a, Supporting Information). In addition, in ZC- and ZRA-treated AD mice, a mass of Aβ plaques and activated microglia were both observed, indicating that these nanoparticles could not reach the brain efficiently enough to encourage microglia to phagocytose Aβ. However, in the TR-ZRA groups, only a few Aβ plaques were observed, and the area of activated microglia decreased in the brain (Figure S16b,c, Supporting Information). These phenomena suggested that after treatment with nanoparticles, the expression of CD22 in microglia was downregulated, which could enhance the dysfunction of healthy microglia, alleviate activated microglial infiltration and promote phagocytosis of Aβ in the brain tissue of AD mice. In conclusion, TR-ZRA, compared with the other treatments, significantly ameliorated Aβ clearance and microglial dysfunction in the brain tissue. It is generally considered that aggregated Aβ1-42 can lead to cytotoxicity.[45] It has been proven that TR-ZRA can downregulate CD22 in microglia, which could improve the ability of BV2 cells to phagocytose Aβ and reduce the toxicity of Aβ to neurons. We performed live/dead staining to investigate the effect of the nanoparticles on Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. BV2 cells were treated with Aβ1-42 in the absence or presence of nanoparticles. After 24–48 h, the culture medium of BV2 cells was removed and incubated with HT22 cells for 24 h to evaluate cell activity. As shown in Figure 9c and Figure S17, Supporting Information, there were a number of dead cells after incubation with Aβ1-42 alone for 24 h. In addition, free ZC or CD22shRNA had little effect due to their poor cellular uptake and Aβ clearance. Nevertheless, the number of dead cells decreased significantly after treatment with TR-ZRA medium, which means that the cells’ functions had been improved. This indicated that the TR-ZRA nanoparticles could reduce Aβ-induced cytotoxicity and promote cell proliferation. Similarly, both HE staining and Nissl staining showed improvements in neuron health after TR-ZRA treatment. As shown in Figure 9d, the nucleoli became clearer, the cells were arranged neatly, and the intracellular Nissl bodies were more abundant, indicating that the neurons were repaired effectively. 2.7. Biodistribution, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Improved Memory Capability In Vivo To evaluate the therapeutic effect of the nanoparticles in vivo, 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice were intravenously injected every 5 days for a month (Figure 10a). To observe the distribution of nanoparticles in vivo, we injected Cy5.5-labeled nanoparticles intravenously into mice. As expected, after intravenous administration, fluorescence images showed that TR-ZRA group showed a strong fluorescence signal in the brain tissue in vivo 72 h after injection (Figure 10b). Besides, we observed the circulation of RhB labeled nanoparticles in mice. As shown in the Figure S18, Supporting Information, free ZC was rapidly cleared from the mouse after injection through the tail vein with a brief half-life. In contrast, for R-ZC, a significant increase in half-life was observed. It should also be noted that the amount of nanoparticles in the TR-ZC group also showed a rapid decrease in the amount of circulating in vivo with the shorter half-life, but the amount in vivo was still relatively higher than that of free ZC. This result may be related to the loading of targeted factors on the nanoparticles after coating, which made most of the nanoparticles concentrate in the brain. This is mainly attributed to the TfR-A aptamer and erythrocyte membrane modification on the nanoparticles, which helped TR-ZRA target endothelial cells in the mouse brain and prolong the circulation in vivo, respectively. 72 h after injection, these mice were sacrificed by the cervical dislocation method. Their brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney tissues were collected for fluorescence imaging in vitro, and the results were consistent with the previous results. As shown in Figure 10c, the ZC and ZRA groups showed a small amount of aggregation in the brain, liver, and kidney, while the accumulation of TR-ZRA in the brain was significantly higher than that in the other groups. Compared to ZC and ZRA, TR-ZRA showed 2.0/1.24-fold-enhanced Cy5.5 signals respectively 72 h after injection, indicating a stronger ability to target and penetrate the BBB (Figure 10d). These results indicated that TR-ZRA had a great targeting effect to brain tissue in vivo. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can clearly display anatomical structures with high resolution, distinguish gray matter from white matter, and measure the area and volume of hippocampal structures in the brain, which means that MRI studies have been important for the clinical identification of AD. After a month of treatment, the brains of WT and AD mice were imaged by MRI. As shown in Figure 10e,f, a reduction in hippocampal region volume was observed in AD mice (17.985 mm3) relative to healthy WT mice (21.8 mm3), which was consistent with previous reports.[46,47] However, after TR-ZRA treatment for a month, there was a slight upward trend in hippocampal volume (18.29 mm3), which might also be related to the amount of drug reaching the brain and the duration of treatment. This demonstrated that therapeutic components, such as chlorogenic acid and RNAi, have the potential to protect neurons, alleviate neuroinflammation and remove more Aβ. On the other hand, the Morris water maze (MWM) experiment is an experiment in which mice are forced to swim and learn to find hidden platforms in the water. It is mainly used to test experimental animals’ learning and memory ability in the context of sensing spatial position and direction. Therefore, the MWM experiment was employed to compare the spatial learning and memory abilities of the mice after a month of treatment. As shown in Figure 10g, the typical swimming track route and the number of target platform passes in each group of mice were recorded. On the test day, the platform was removed, and AD mice treated with PBS had severe memory deficits and displayed no significant improvement after 5 days of spatial learning (Figure S19, Supporting Information). However, AD mice treated with TR-ZRA displayed substantially shorter escape latencies to target, with a 58.7% decrease compared with the PBS-treated group (Figure 10h). In addition, compared with the other groups, the TR-ZRA group crossed the platform more times (1.7 times) and spent more time (22.1%) in the target quadrant (Figure 10i,j). These behavioral experimental results indicate that TR-ZRA could alleviate memory impairment in AD mice to a certain extent. Moreover, when all treatments were finished, the major organs of the mice were analyzed by HE staining (Figure S20, Supporting Information). The nanoparticles did not cause any pathologic changes in the major organs in these mice, indicating clear biocompatibility in vivo after 4 weeks of treatment via intravenous injection."

Antioxidation and adjustable treatment strategies are critical for the
effective treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we design a
dual-targeted Prussian blue nanoformulation (PTCN) that can cross
the blood-brain barrier and target amyloid beta aggregates further exert
antioxidant effects. An adjustable gradient dosing strategy with PTCN is
used for the ﬁrst time to design the preventive and therapeutic trials
based on the severity of oxidative stress at different AD stages. The re-
sults show that PTCN could effectively ameliorate AD-related patholog-
ical processes, improve the cognitive decline, and rescue hippocampal
atrophy of APP/PS1 mice in both preventive and therapeutic trials. Alto-
gether, PTCN provided here is a successful combination of three tradi-
tional biomaterials with good biosafety, which has broad prospects for
the early prevention, mild remission, and late treatment of AD, and is ex-
pected to be developed into personalized therapeutic drugs and health-
care products for clinical AD in the future.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease charac-
terized by cognitive decline. However, most clinical drugs end in failure in AD
treatment. Oxidative stress (OS), which refers mainly to oxidative damage
induced by excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays
as i g n iﬁcant role in AD.1,2 The brain is highly susceptible to oxidative at-
tacks,3,4 and the body’s own antioxidant system normally defends against
oxidative attacks to ensure low ROS levels. Under pathological conditions,
endogenous antioxidants are extremely vulnerable to damage and interfer-
ence, which weakens antioxidant functions in the brain. The produced ROS
accumulate continuously and cannot be effectively eliminated before result-
ing in irreversible OS, which interacts with other pathogenic mechanisms
during AD and eventually leads to cognitive impairments.5– 7 Therefore, devel-
opment of exogenous antioxidants that can combat OS is very important for
AD treatment.
Many developed exogenous molecular antioxidants exhibit poor perfor-
mance in cognitive function improvement for several potential reasons.
8,9
Firstly, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) blocks access to the brain.10,11 Secondly,
some antioxidants that entered the brain diffuse and cannot effectively
concentrate in the pathological areas of AD, resulting in insufﬁcient working
concentration.12 Nanoantioxidants can target lesions through surface modi-
ﬁcation and have been developed to treat diseases associated with OS,
including AD.13,14 Notably, Prussian blue (PB)-associated nanoparticles
(NPs) have been reported to be effective in removing ROS,15,16 which have
been generally considered to be biosafe because the major component,
PB, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).17
In addition, due to the simple preparation process and good reproducibility,
PB NPs have considerable potential as exogenous antioxidants for use in
AD treatment.
Designing a ﬂexible and adjustable treatment program based on the
occurrence and development of AD remains a major challenge. Clinical AD
is usually divided into three stages (early stage, mild; middle stage, moderate;
and late stage, severe).
18 Currently, most research focuses on the middle and
late stages of AD, lacking intervention strategies for the early stage or even
the whole disease process. OS has been proposed to be one of the causes
of AD and worsens with disease progression,
19– 21 while other pathological
molecules have also been found to exhibit different changes in different
stages.
22– 24 Therefore, ﬂexible and adjustable antioxidant treatment based
on the different degrees of OS in different AD stages would help alleviate
other pathologies and enable personalized treatment of AD.
Herein, a dual-targeted PB@PEG-TF/CR NPs (PTCN) was assembled from
traditional biomaterials and administrated using an antioxidation-guided
adjustable dosing strategy for potential prevention and therapy of AD. The
PB NPs in PTCN can exert antioxidant effects to scavenge ROS, and surface
modiﬁcation with transferrin (TF) and Congo red (CR) enables to traverse
the BBB and target amyloid beta (Ab) aggregates, respectively.
25– 27 The
designed antioxidation-guided adjustable dosing strategy with PTCN can
effectively attenuate OS in the hippocampus, thereby ameliorating other path-
ological processes and ultimately improving the cognitive functions and
rescuing hippocampal atrophy for both preventive and therapeutic trials of
APP/PS1 mice. Altogether, this work reveals the potential of PTCN to be
developed as a promising drug and healthcare product for clinical personal-
ized treatment of AD, realizing the early prevention, mild remission, and late
treatment of AD.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Synthesis and characterization of PTCN
PTCN was synthesized by simultaneous surface modiﬁcation of carboxyl-
ated PEGylated PB NPs (PB@PEG NPs) with TF and CR (Figure S1). Trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that PTCN exhibited a
clear spherical shape and good uniformity (Figure 1A). The hydrodynamic
diameter and zeta potential of PTCN (198± 18.27 nm,/C015.97 ± 0.28 mV)
(Figure S2) were larger than those of PB@PEG NPs (88.79± 4.50 nm,
/C035.83± 0.23 mV) (Figure S3). Moreover, PTCN exhibited a TF characteristic
peak at 270 nm and CR characteristic peaks at both 350 and 500 nm in UV-
vis-NIR spectra (Figure 1B). These results indicated that PB@PEG NPs were
successfully modiﬁed with TF and CR. Notably, the hydrodynamic diameter
of PTCN showed no signiﬁcant changes for 14 days, indicating its excellent
stability for further application (Figure S4).
Next, we veriﬁed two important functions of PTCN, including crossing of
the BBB and targeting of Ab aggregates in the brain. TF modiﬁcation has
been widely demonstrated to help NPs cross the BBB via TF receptor-medi-
ated endocytosis.

PTCN, a compact monolayer of mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3)

PTCN penetrated through the bEnd.3 monolayers, which was obviously
higher than 0.8% of PB@PEG NPs (Figure 1D). After excess free TF was
pre-incubated to block TF receptor-mediated endocytosis, the penetration ef-
ﬁciency of PTCN was reduced to 3.5%, indicating that TF receptor-mediated
endocytosis played a key role in the penetration process of PTCN. Then, on
the basis of removing the endogenous Fe content in the untreated control
group, the efﬁciency of PTCN entering the brain was evaluated by quantitative
analysis of the increased Fe content in the brain. The results showed that the
brain utilization of PTCN was approximately 5.9% at 3 h post-injection,
reached the peak at 12 h post-injection,and retained 24 h after injection, while
that of NPs without TF modiﬁcation was almost zero (Figure 1E). In addition
to brain utilization, the mass fraction of Fe in the brain was calculated; the re-
sults showed that PTCN increased the brain average Fe content by 90% 3 h
after injection, which was signiﬁcantly higher than the control group (Fig-
ure 1E). Furthermore, the presence of PTCN in hippocampal tissues of
APP/PS1 mice at 3 h post-injection was further conﬁrmed by biological
TEM. Unmodiﬁed PB@PEG NPs were found in blood vessels but not in the
hippocampus, demonstrating that PB@PEG NPs without TF modiﬁcation
cannot pass through the BBB into the brain (Figure S5). As expected,

The Innovation PTCN was observed not only in blood vessels but also in the hippocampus. In
particular, we not only observed the presence of PTCN on the luminal side of
endothelial cells but also the efﬂux of PTCN on the ablumenal side of the BBB,
intuitively showing that PTCN can penetrate to the hippocampus from the
blood vessels. These results strongly demonstrate that TF-modiﬁed PTCN
can effectively cross the BBB, enter the brain, and enrich in the hippocampus
of mice.
What’s more, it has been reported that CR can be speciﬁcally bound to Ab
aggregates by unique hydrogen bonds and that the resulting CR-Ab complex
greatly enhances the redﬂuorescence of CR,
27 which is typically weak. To
verify this speciﬁcb i n d i n go fP T C Nw i t hAb aggregates, theﬂuorescence in-
tensities of PTCN and CR combined with Ab aggregates were measured and
compared with those of free CR and Ab aggregates alone. After binding with
Ab aggregates, both PTCN and CR showed signiﬁcantly heightenedﬂuores-
cence intensities, and theﬂuorescence intensity of PTCN combined with
100 mMA b aggregates was approximately 1.5 times stronger than that of
PTCN alone (Figure S6). Under an invertedﬂuorescence microscope, only
these complexes were clearly observed and had greatly enhanced redﬂuo-
rescence (Figure S7). Furthermore, thein vitro ﬂuorescence of the PTCN-
Ab complex was also evaluated by anin vivoimaging system. Theﬂuores-
cence enhancement of the PTCN-Ab complex was not signiﬁcantly less
than that of the CR-Ab complex (Figures 1Fa n d1 G ) .T h e nin vivo ﬂuores-
cence imaging was performed on APP/PS1 mice with high levels of Abag-
gregates in the brain, and demonstrated that only PTCN-treated APP/PS1
mice showed strongﬂuorescence signals in the brain region, but not in other
organs (Figures 1H and 1I), indicating thatﬂuorescence was only visible
when the CR on PTCN bound to Ab in the brain. All these results conﬁrm
that PTCN can pass through the BBB and speciﬁcally combine with Ab
aggregates.
ROS-scavenging ability of PTCN
The ROS-scavenging ability of PTCN is essential for its effective antioxi-
dant activity in the treatment of AD. Therefore, we investigated the ability
of PTCN to act like multiple enzymes, including superoxide dismutase
(SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD), as well as its hydroxyl radical
scavenging (HRS) activity.
25,28 These types of activity are key to removal of
ROS. First, SOD-like activity was evaluated via assessment of O2
$– scav-
enging. Excessive O2
$– was generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase
system and detected by formazan formation using a WST-8 assay kit. The
O
2
$– inhibition rate gradually increased with PTCN concentration (Figure 1J),
indicating good SOD-like activity of PTCN. Second, since O2
$– can be dismu-
tated spontaneously or catalyzed by SOD to form H2O2, which is another
important ROS, H2O2 scavenging was used to evaluate CAT-like activity
and POD-like activity. CAT-like activity was investigated via assessment of
H2O2 decomposition to produce O2. After PTCN was added into 30% H2O2
solution, the amount of bubbles increased with PTCN concentration, while
PTCN alone did not exhibit bubbles (Figure S8). Quantitative analysis of dis-
solved oxygen showed that PTCN catalyzed production of O
2 from H2O2 in a
concentration- and time-dependent manner (Figure 1K). Furthermore, POD-
like activity was investigated by catalyzing the reaction of H2O2 with the nat-
ural substrate 3,5,30,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). PTCN treatment resulted
in the characteristic absorbance of the products of H2O2-mediated TMB
oxidation at 650 nm, and the effect increased with the PTCN concentration
(Figure 1I). These results conﬁrmed the good CAT-like activity and POD-like
activity of PTCN. Finally, HRS activity was evaluated via assessment of scav-
enging of$OH, which is considered to be an initiator of lipid peroxidation. A
TiO
2/UV system was chosen to generate$OH, which was trapped by 5,5-
dimethyl-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and detected by electron spin resonance.
The signal intensity of DMPO/$OH was progressively reduced with increasing
PTCN concentrations, suggesting adirect scavenging effect of PTCN on$OH
(Figure S9). These results reveal that all the enzyme-like activities of PTCN
exhibit concentration dependence and that PTCN is an effective antioxidant
with ROS-scavenging activity.
It is generally believed that iron-based NPs can react with H2O2 to cause
Fenton reaction and produce$O H ,t h u sm e d i a t i n gb i o t o x i c i t y .29 Therefore,
the assessment of whether PTCN can undergo Fenton reaction was crucial
for the correct evaluation of ROS-scavenging activity and the potential
biosafety of PTCN. As shown in Figure S10,t h eF e S O4 and H2O2
system has been considered a classic Fenton reaction model, and the
produced$OH could speciﬁcally react with salicylic acid to form 2,3-dihydrox-
ybenzoic acid, exhibiting an obvious UV absorption peak at 510 nm.
30 How-
ever, there was no absorption peak at 510 nm representing$OH generation
observed after replacing FeSO4 with PTCN. Our results demonstrated that
PTCN had no Fenton-like activity, which was similar to previous studies.25,31
Furthermore, considering that the chemical stability of PTCN in acidic solu-
tions was not negligible for the efﬁciency of antioxidant activity and TF-medi-
ated BBB crossing, we further assessed the possible iron release from PTCN
as well as the detachment of targeting groups in the lysosomal mimicﬂuid.
Acetate buffer, pH 3.6, was used to mimic lysosomal-like acidic condition,
and PTCN was incubated with this buffer for 48 h, and then the suspension
was centrifuged to obtain precipitate and supernatant. After replacing FeSO
4
in the Fenton reaction model with the supernatant and precipitate of PTCN,
no absorption peak at 510 nm was observed, and the characteristic absorp-
tion peak of PB at 700 nm was still observed in the precipitation (Figure S10),
demonstrating that the structure of PB as the core component of PTCN was
not affected and that no iron was released from the PTCN in the lysosomal
mimic ﬂuid. In addition, the characteristic peaks of TF, CR, and PB were still
retained in the precipitate, but not found in the supernatant (Figure S11), indi-
cating that targeting groups were not detached from PTCN in the lysosomal
mimic ﬂuid.
Antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of PTCN in PC12 cells
To test whether ROS scavenging by PTCN could provide neuroprotection,
we evaluated the effect of PTCN on the viability of PC12 cells under H
2O2
oxidative shock.32 Cytotoxicity tests wereﬁr s tc a r r i e do u to nP T C N .A m o n g
the components of PTCN, PB and TF have been approved by the FDA, and CR
shows very low cytotoxicity (Figure S12). Cell viability after treatment with
PTCN, at all studied concentrations, exceeded 80%, indicating PTCN’sl o w
cytotoxicity (Figure S13). Then, H
2O2 was used for oxidative shock to
construct a cell model of OS. Oxidative shock signiﬁcantly reduced cell
viability, with greater effects at higher H2O2 concentrations (Figure 2A). To
assess the therapeutic effects of PTCN on cells under oxidative shock, cells
were ﬁrst treated with H
2O2 and then with PTCN. Cell viability was obviously
lower in H2O2-treated cells than in untreated control cells, and the reduction
was exacerbated with increasing H2O2 concentrations (Figure 2B). PTCN
posttreatment greatly rescued the cell viability, resulting in even higher
viability in the posttreatment group than in the control group (Figure 2B),
which may have been attributable to the oxygen produced through H
2O2
decomposition. To assess the preventive effects of PTCN on oxidative shock
in cells, cells were treated with PTCN and then with H2O2. PTCN pretreatment
also greatly enhanced cell viability, as the viability was greater in pretreated
cells subjected to oxidative shock than in the cells subjected to oxidative
shock alone, and the effect increased with increasing PTCN concentration
(Figure 2C). These results indicate that PTCN posttreatment and pretreat-
ment can effectively rescue cells and prevent the cell death caused by
H
2O2 oxidative shock, respectively.
Then, the effects of PTCN posttreatment and pretreatment on cellular ROS
levels and apoptosis under H2O2 oxidative shock were further studied. DCFH-
DA staining was performed to measure cellular ROS levels. Unlike the control
treatment and PTCN alone, H
2O2 treatment caused excess ROS production
in cells and resulted in shrunken cellsand decreased numbers of synapses
(Figures 2D and 2E). PTCN posttreatment and pretreatment restored the
morphology of cells and synapses, while reducing the elevations in ROS
levels caused by H
2O2 oxidative shock (Figures 2Da n dS14). These results
were further demonstrated byﬂow cytometric quantitativeﬂuorescence anal-
ysis (Figures 2Ea n dS15). Dual staining with Calcein-AM and propidium io-
dide was performed to mark live and dead cells. The results showed that cells
were destroyed after H2O2 oxidative shock, while PTCN posttreatment and
pretreatment prevented the cells from being damaged (Figure S16). More-
over, ﬂow cytometric quantitative apoptosis analysis demonstrated that

The Innovation PTCN posttreatment signiﬁcantly improved the survival rate from 54.6% (un-
der H2O2 oxidative shock) to 83.4%; similarly, PTCN pretreatment increased
the survival rate to 84.6% (Figure 2F). These results suggest that PTCN pro-
vides excellent neuroprotection against oxidative shock for both preventive
and therapeutic treatments.
Behavioral and hippocampal volume assessment for evaluation of the
efﬁcacy of PTCN for AD prevention and therapyin vivo
Beforein vivotreatments, the biosafety of PTCN was demonstrated by he-
matoxylin and eosin staining (Figure S17) and routine blood analysis (Table
S1). Next, we quantitatively analyzed Fe content in the blood of APP/PS1
mice after intravenous injection of PTCN using ICP-MS. As shown inFig-
ure S18, we observed high blood Fe content at 0.5 h post-injection and a
decrease of only 33% at 48 h post-injection, suggesting that PTCN composed
mainly of Fe might have longer blood circulation. On the basis of the brain uti-
lization and blood Fe content of PTCN, we designed a gradient dosing strat-
egy for the preventive and therapeutic trials with APP/PS1 mice according to
the severity of OS in different AD stages (Figures 3Aa n dS19). For the preven-
tive trial, APP/PS1 mice at the age of 10 weeks were treated with a low dose
of PTCN until 16 weeks and then with a medium dose until 22 weeks, while,

The Innovation for the therapeutic trial, APP/PPS1 mice at the age of 25 weeks were treated
with a high dose until 31 weeks.
Cognitive behaviors were assessed with a Morris water maze (MWM) test
(Figures 3B and 3F). To exclude the possible difference in sensorimotor func-
tions between each group, the swimming speed of each group wasﬁrst
calculated and no signiﬁcant difference was found among the three groups
in both preventive and therapeutic trials (Figure S20). In both the preventive
and therapeutic trials, the escape latency of PTCN-treated APP/PS1 mice
was signiﬁcantly shorter than that of untreated APP/PS1 mice (Figures 3C
and 3G). Remarkably, both PTCN-treated APP/PS1 mice and wild-type
(WT) mice showed a preference for the target quadrant, while untreated
APP/PS1 mice rarely swam across it (Figures 3D and 3H). Similarly, PTCN
treatment signiﬁcantly increased the number of crossings of APP/PS1
mice over the platform in both the preventive and therapeutic trials (Figures
3E and 3I). Then, we evaluated hippocampal volume changes by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) since hippocampal atrophy is a recognized biolog-
ical marker of AD.
33– 35 In both the preventive and therapeutic trials, there
were no differences in hippocampal volumes between PTCN-treated APP/
PS1 mice and WT mice, while the volumes in untreated APP/PS1 mice
were much smaller than those in WT mice (Figures 3J, 3K, andS21). Overall,
these results suggest that, as AD progresses, cognitive impairment gradually
worsens, and the impairment is accompanied by pronounced hippocampal
atrophy; however, PTCN treatment through an adjustable gradient dosing
strategy in the early and late stages of AD can effectively ameliorate cognitive
impairments and hippocampal atrophy.
Ascertainment of the pathological mechanisms targeted by PTCN
antioxidant treatment
To further explore the pathological mechanisms targeted by PTCN antiox-
idant treatment, pathological changes in the mouse hippocampus were
detected monthly during both preventive (Figure 4A) and therapeutic trials
(Figure 5A) by western blot analysis. First, lipid peroxidation and DNA oxida-
tive damage represented by 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxyguano-
sine (8-OHG), respectively, were analyzed to evaluate the alleviation of OS by
PTCN. The 4-HNE assay results showed that 4-HNE appeared at 10 weeks in
APP/PS1 mice and that the levels gradually increased (Figure 4A); however,
the levels were slightly reduced after PTCN treatment in the preventive trial
(Figure 4B). Notably, the levels of 4-HNE were higher in the older APP/PS1
mice than in the younger mice (Figure 5A) and were signiﬁcantly reduced
by PTCN treatment in the therapeutic trial (Figure 5B). The 8-OHG results
showed that, during the preventive trial, a difference in 8-OHG level between
APP/PS1 mice and WT mice appeared at 10 weeks, but the difference was
gradually eliminated by PTCN treatment (Figures 4A and 4B). During the ther-
apeutic trial, the 8-OHG level in APP/PS1 mice was quite high and was also
greatly reduced by PTCN treatment to reach the same level as that in WT
mice (Figures 5A and 5B). These results indicated that lipid peroxidation
and DNA oxidative damage occurred at the beginning of the AD process
and were gradually aggravated. PTCN treatment more effectively alleviated
DNA oxidative damage than lipid peroxidation in the early stage of AD, while
it alleviated both in the late stage of AD.
Next, we investigated other AD-related pathological changes that
have been reported to interact with OS, including Ab aggregates,
36 mitochon-
drial dysfunction,37,38 inﬂammation,39 synaptic damage,40 and neuronal
apoptosis.41 PTCN treatment slightly but nonsigniﬁcantly reduced Ab aggre-
gates (Figures 4A, 4B,5A, and 5B) in APP/PS1 mice. Given the apparent im-
provements in cognitive behavior and hippocampal volume, Ab is very likely
not the primary cause of cognitive impairments in AD, which is consistent
with the fact that most clinical drugs for Ab have failed. Obvious increases
in dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) levels and decreases in mitofusin 2
and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV levels were observed from 10 to
32 weeks in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, indicating mitochondrial
dysfunction (Figures 4Aa n d5A). PTCN treatment regulated the levels of
mitochondrial function markers to close to normal levels, except for DRP1
(Figures 4Ca n d5C). The continuous activation of astrocytes and microglia
as well as the increased levels of inﬂammatory cytokines in APP/PS1 mice
indicated severe inﬂammation(Figures 4Aa n d5A). Notably, PTCN treatment
markedly inhibited microglial activation and reduced inﬂammatory cytokine
levels in the preventive trial but only slightly inhibited microglial activation and

The Innovation reduced inﬂammatory cytokine levels in the therapeutic trial (Figures 4D, 4E,
5D and 5E). Marked synaptic damage represented by decreased levels of
synapsin 1 and postsynaptic density protein 95 was observed in APP/PS1
mice (Figures 4Aa n d5A). As expected, continued deterioration was
restrained by PTCN treatment in both the preventive and therapeutic trials
(Figures 4Fa n d5F). Neuronal apoptosis was abnormal at 10 weeks in
APP/PS1 mice, as characterized by increased levels of P53 and caspase-3
and decreased levels of BCL-2 (Figures 4Aa n d5A). In the preventive trial,
P53 and caspase-3 levels were downregulated nonsigniﬁcantly, while BCL-
2l e v e l sw e r es i g n iﬁcantly upregulated after PTCN treatment (Figure 4G).
In the therapeutic trial, the upregulation of BCL-2 as well as downregulation
of P53 and caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly observed after PTCN treatment (Fig-
ure 5G). So the mechanisms by which PTCN treatment attenuated neuronal
death in the preventive trial and the therapeutic trial were considered to be
different. Overall, PTCN counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction and synap-
tic damage during the entire process of AD. In the early stage of AD, PTCN
also signiﬁcantly inhibited inﬂammation and mildly inhibited neuronal
apoptosis. In contrast, in the late stage of AD, PTCN weakly reduced inﬂam-
mation but signiﬁcantly enhanced apoptosis inhibition. These results
demonstrate that PTCN administration via a gradient dosing strategy can
effectively and continuously attenuate oxidative damage throughout
different AD stages, thus attenuating other AD-related pathological mecha-
nisms to varying degrees. Theseﬁndings suggest that PTCN is a promising
multitarget drug for both preventive and therapeutic treatments of AD.
Conclusion
In summary, PTCN, which consists of dual-targeted PTCN, was con-
structed for potential prevention and therapy of AD. Compared with the
current nanotechnology to treat AD, the designed strategy in this study is su-
perior in the following three aspects. Firstly, this work provides a simple and
easy assembly of three traditional biomaterials. PB is a clinical therapeutic
drug approved by the FDA, TF is a transporter of iron in human plasma
that mediates BBB crossing, and CR is a common clinical diagnostic reagent
for amyloidosis, all of which are widely used biomaterials and have good
biosafety forin vivo application. These three components are connected
with chemical bonds to form multifunctional PTCN, revealing a new combi-
nation of traditional biomaterials. Our results validated the function of the
above three components and demonstrated that PTCN with excellent
biosafety could largely accumulate in AD lesions and exert substantial antiox-
idant effects. Secondly, this workﬁrst proposes an antioxidation-guided
gradient dosing strategy that can be implemented throughout the course
of AD from prevention to therapy. At present, the application of nanoantioxi-
dant in AD treatment has gradually attracted attention, but most studies
focus on the late treatment of severe cognitive impairment, and there is still
a lack of research on early prevention and mild remission. In this work, the
doses of PTCN can be adjusted according to the OS levels at different stages
of the AD process, and the results showed that this strategy could effectively
inhibit OS, ameliorate other pathological processes to varying degrees, and
ultimately rescue cognitive impairment and hippocampal atrophy of APP/
PS1 mice in both preventive and therapeutic trials. Finally, PTCN has great
potential to be developed as a therapeutic drug and healthcare product for
AD. As mentioned above, PTCN is an integration of three traditional biomate-
rials with a simple preparation method and high repeatability, and bothin vitro
and in vivoresults have conﬁrmed good biosafety of PTCN, which is condu-
cive to future industrialization and clinical application. More importantly,
PTCN can be applied to different stages of AD through the above antioxida-
tion-guided gradient dosing strategy. We even hope that PTCN can be devel-
oped as a healthcare product similar to vitamins, which can be taken in a
h
ealthy state to prevent future occurrences. In addition to AD, the roles of
OS in the occurrence and development of other diseases have received
increasing attention,
42-44 and PTCN may have considerable potential as a
broad antioxidant for the treatment of various other OS diseases.

The Innovation ","PTFE-based Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) were synthesized for dual-targeting of Alzheimer's disease. PBNPs specifically bound to amyloid-beta plaques and transferrin receptors, achieving synergistic therapeutic effects by simultaneously delivering iron ions and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). In vivo experiments demonstrated that PBNPs effectively alleviated cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The study revealed a significant reduction in Aβ plaque load and improved synaptic function, along with decreased levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and acrolein, indicating reduced oxidative stress. Additionally, MRI analysis showed that PBNPs could effectively reduce hippocampal atrophy associated with Alzheimer's disease. Overall, this dual-targeting strategy offers a promising approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease through combined iron ion delivery and ROS scavenging.","Antioxidation and adjustable treatment strategies are critical for the effective treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we design a dual-targeted Prussian blue nanoformulation (PTCN) that can cross the blood-brain barrier and target amyloid beta aggregates further exert antioxidant effects. An adjustable gradient dosing strategy with PTCN is used for the ﬁrst time to design the preventive and therapeutic trials based on the severity of oxidative stress at different AD stages. The results show that PTCN could effectively ameliorate AD-related pathological processes, improve the cognitive decline, and rescue hippocampal atrophy of APP/PS1 mice in both preventive and therapeutic trials. Altogether, PTCN provided here is a successful combination of three traditional biomaterials with good biosafety, which has broad prospects for the early prevention, mild remission, and late treatment of AD, and is expected to be developed into personalized therapeutic drugs and health-care products for clinical AD in the future.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive decline. However, most clinical drugs end in failure in AD treatment. Oxidative stress (OS), which refers mainly to oxidative damage induced by excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays as i g n iﬁcant role in AD.1,2 The brain is highly susceptible to oxidative attacks,3,4 and the body’s own antioxidant system normally defends against oxidative attacks to ensure low ROS levels. Under pathological conditions, endogenous antioxidants are extremely vulnerable to damage and interfer-ence, which weakens antioxidant functions in the brain. The produced ROS accumulate continuously and cannot be effectively eliminated before result-ing in irreversible OS, which interacts with other pathogenic mechanisms during AD and eventually leads to cognitive impairments.5– 7 Therefore, devel-opment of exogenous antioxidants that can combat OS is very important for AD treatment. Many developed exogenous molecular antioxidants exhibit poor perfor-mance in cognitive function improvement for several potential reasons.8,9 Firstly, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) blocks access to the brain.10,11 Secondly, some antioxidants that entered the brain diffuse and cannot effectively concentrate in the pathological areas of AD, resulting in insufﬁcient working concentration.12 Nanoantioxidants can target lesions through surface modi-ﬁcation and have been developed to treat diseases associated with OS, including AD.13,14 Notably, Prussian blue (PB)-associated nanoparticles (NPs) have been reported to be effective in removing ROS,15,16 which have been generally considered to be biosafe because the major component, PB, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).17 In addition, due to the simple preparation process and good reproducibility, PB NPs have considerable potential as exogenous antioxidants for use in AD treatment. Designing a ﬂexible and adjustable treatment program based on the occurrence and development of AD remains a major challenge. Clinical AD is usually divided into three stages (early stage, mild; middle stage, moderate; and late stage, severe).18 Currently, most research focuses on the middle and late stages of AD, lacking intervention strategies for the early stage or even the whole disease process. OS has been proposed to be one of the causes of AD and worsens with disease progression,19– 21 while other pathological molecules have also been found to exhibit different changes in different stages.22– 24 Therefore, ﬂexible and adjustable antioxidant treatment based on the different degrees of OS in different AD stages would help alleviate other pathologies and enable personalized treatment of AD. Herein, a dual-targeted PB@PEG-TF/CR NPs (PTCN) was assembled from traditional biomaterials and administrated using an antioxidation-guided adjustable dosing strategy for potential prevention and therapy of AD. The PB NPs in PTCN can exert antioxidant effects to scavenge ROS, and surface modiﬁcation with transferrin (TF) and Congo red (CR) enables to traverse the BBB and target amyloid beta (Ab) aggregates, respectively.25– 27 The designed antioxidation-guided adjustable dosing strategy with PTCN can effectively attenuate OS in the hippocampus, thereby ameliorating other path-ological processes and ultimately improving the cognitive functions and rescuing hippocampal atrophy for both preventive and therapeutic trials of APP/PS1 mice. Altogether, this work reveals the potential of PTCN to be developed as a promising drug and healthcare product for clinical personal-ized treatment of AD, realizing the early prevention, mild remission, and late treatment of AD.","Synthesis and characterization of PTCN PTCN was synthesized by simultaneous surface modiﬁcation of carboxyl-ated PEGylated PB NPs (PB@PEG NPs) with TF and CR (Figure S1). Trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that PTCN exhibited a clear spherical shape and good uniformity (Figure 1A). The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of PTCN (198± 18.27 nm,/C015.97 ± 0.28 mV) (Figure S2) were larger than those of PB@PEG NPs (88.79± 4.50 nm, /C035.83± 0.23 mV) (Figure S3). Moreover, PTCN exhibited a TF characteristic peak at 270 nm and CR characteristic peaks at both 350 and 500 nm in UV-vis-NIR spectra (Figure 1B). These results indicated that PB@PEG NPs were successfully modiﬁed with TF and CR. Notably, the hydrodynamic diameter of PTCN showed no signiﬁcant changes for 14 days, indicating its excellent stability for further application (Figure S4). Next, we veriﬁed two important functions of PTCN, including crossing of the BBB and targeting of Ab aggregates in the brain. TF modiﬁcation has been widely demonstrated to help NPs cross the BBB via TF receptor-medi-ated endocytosis.26 To demonstrate TF-mediated BBB crossing function of PTCN, a compact monolayer of mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) was implanted into transwellﬁlters. Transendothelial electrical resistance values during the experiments were all above 180U$cm2, indicating the membrane integrity (Figure 1C ) .A f t e r1 2hi n c u b a t i o no fN P s ,7 . 2 %o f PTCN penetrated through the bEnd.3 monolayers, which was obviously higher than 0.8% of PB@PEG NPs (Figure 1D). After excess free TF was pre-incubated to block TF receptor-mediated endocytosis, the penetration ef-ﬁciency of PTCN was reduced to 3.5%, indicating that TF receptor-mediated endocytosis played a key role in the penetration process of PTCN. Then, on the basis of removing the endogenous Fe content in the untreated control group, the efﬁciency of PTCN entering the brain was evaluated by quantitative analysis of the increased Fe content in the brain. The results showed that the brain utilization of PTCN was approximately 5.9% at 3 h post-injection, reached the peak at 12 h post-injection,and retained 24 h after injection, while that of NPs without TF modiﬁcation was almost zero (Figure 1E). In addition to brain utilization, the mass fraction of Fe in the brain was calculated; the re-sults showed that PTCN increased the brain average Fe content by 90% 3 h after injection, which was signiﬁcantly higher than the control group (Fig-ure 1E). Furthermore, the presence of PTCN in hippocampal tissues of APP/PS1 mice at 3 h post-injection was further conﬁrmed by biological TEM. Unmodiﬁed PB@PEG NPs were found in blood vessels but not in the hippocampus, demonstrating that PB@PEG NPs without TF modiﬁcation cannot pass through the BBB into the brain (Figure S5). As expected, PTCN was observed not only in blood vessels but also in the hippocampus. In particular, we not only observed the presence of PTCN on the luminal side of endothelial cells but also the efﬂux of PTCN on the ablumenal side of the BBB, intuitively showing that PTCN can penetrate to the hippocampus from the blood vessels. These results strongly demonstrate that TF-modiﬁed PTCN can effectively cross the BBB, enter the brain, and enrich in the hippocampus of mice. What’s more, it has been reported that CR can be speciﬁcally bound to Ab aggregates by unique hydrogen bonds and that the resulting CR-Ab complex greatly enhances the redﬂuorescence of CR,27 which is typically weak. To verify this speciﬁcb i n d i n go fP T C Nw i t hAb aggregates, theﬂuorescence in-tensities of PTCN and CR combined with Ab aggregates were measured and compared with those of free CR and Ab aggregates alone. After binding with Ab aggregates, both PTCN and CR showed signiﬁcantly heightenedﬂuores-cence intensities, and theﬂuorescence intensity of PTCN combined with 100 mMA b aggregates was approximately 1.5 times stronger than that of PTCN alone (Figure S6). Under an invertedﬂuorescence microscope, only these complexes were clearly observed and had greatly enhanced redﬂuo-rescence (Figure S7). Furthermore, thein vitro ﬂuorescence of the PTCN-Ab complex was also evaluated by anin vivoimaging system. Theﬂuores-cence enhancement of the PTCN-Ab complex was not signiﬁcantly less than that of the CR-Ab complex (Figures 1Fa n d1 G ) .T h e nin vivo ﬂuores-cence imaging was performed on APP/PS1 mice with high levels of Abag-gregates in the brain, and demonstrated that only PTCN-treated APP/PS1 mice showed strongﬂuorescence signals in the brain region, but not in other organs (Figures 1H and 1I), indicating thatﬂuorescence was only visible when the CR on PTCN bound to Ab in the brain. All these results conﬁrm that PTCN can pass through the BBB and speciﬁcally combine with Ab aggregates. ROS-scavenging ability of PTCN The ROS-scavenging ability of PTCN is essential for its effective antioxi-dant activity in the treatment of AD. Therefore, we investigated the ability of PTCN to act like multiple enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD), as well as its hydroxyl radical scavenging (HRS) activity.25,28 These types of activity are key to removal of ROS. First, SOD-like activity was evaluated via assessment of O2$– scav-enging. Excessive O2$– was generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and detected by formazan formation using a WST-8 assay kit. The O2$– inhibition rate gradually increased with PTCN concentration (Figure 1J), indicating good SOD-like activity of PTCN. Second, since O2$– can be dismu-tated spontaneously or catalyzed by SOD to form H2O2, which is another important ROS, H2O2 scavenging was used to evaluate CAT-like activity and POD-like activity. CAT-like activity was investigated via assessment of H2O2 decomposition to produce O2. After PTCN was added into 30% H2O2 solution, the amount of bubbles increased with PTCN concentration, while PTCN alone did not exhibit bubbles (Figure S8). Quantitative analysis of dis-solved oxygen showed that PTCN catalyzed production of O2 from H2O2 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Figure 1K). Furthermore, POD-like activity was investigated by catalyzing the reaction of H2O2 with the nat-ural substrate 3,5,30,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). PTCN treatment resulted in the characteristic absorbance of the products of H2O2-mediated TMB oxidation at 650 nm, and the effect increased with the PTCN concentration (Figure 1I). These results conﬁrmed the good CAT-like activity and POD-like activity of PTCN. Finally, HRS activity was evaluated via assessment of scav-enging of$OH, which is considered to be an initiator of lipid peroxidation. A TiO2/UV system was chosen to generate$OH, which was trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and detected by electron spin resonance. The signal intensity of DMPO/$OH was progressively reduced with increasing PTCN concentrations, suggesting adirect scavenging effect of PTCN on$OH (Figure S9). These results reveal that all the enzyme-like activities of PTCN exhibit concentration dependence and that PTCN is an effective antioxidant with ROS-scavenging activity. It is generally believed that iron-based NPs can react with H2O2 to cause Fenton reaction and produce$O H ,t h u sm e d i a t i n gb i o t o x i c i t y .29 Therefore, the assessment of whether PTCN can undergo Fenton reaction was crucial for the correct evaluation of ROS-scavenging activity and the potential biosafety of PTCN. As shown in Figure S10,t h eF e S O4 and H2O2 system has been considered a classic Fenton reaction model, and the produced$OH could speciﬁcally react with salicylic acid to form 2,3-dihydrox-ybenzoic acid, exhibiting an obvious UV absorption peak at 510 nm.30 How-ever, there was no absorption peak at 510 nm representing$OH generation observed after replacing FeSO4 with PTCN. Our results demonstrated that PTCN had no Fenton-like activity, which was similar to previous studies.25,31 Furthermore, considering that the chemical stability of PTCN in acidic solu-tions was not negligible for the efﬁciency of antioxidant activity and TF-medi-ated BBB crossing, we further assessed the possible iron release from PTCN as well as the detachment of targeting groups in the lysosomal mimicﬂuid. Acetate buffer, pH 3.6, was used to mimic lysosomal-like acidic condition, and PTCN was incubated with this buffer for 48 h, and then the suspension was centrifuged to obtain precipitate and supernatant. After replacing FeSO4 in the Fenton reaction model with the supernatant and precipitate of PTCN, no absorption peak at 510 nm was observed, and the characteristic absorp-tion peak of PB at 700 nm was still observed in the precipitation (Figure S10), demonstrating that the structure of PB as the core component of PTCN was not affected and that no iron was released from the PTCN in the lysosomal mimic ﬂuid. In addition, the characteristic peaks of TF, CR, and PB were still retained in the precipitate, but not found in the supernatant (Figure S11), indi-cating that targeting groups were not detached from PTCN in the lysosomal mimic ﬂuid. Antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of PTCN in PC12 cells To test whether ROS scavenging by PTCN could provide neuroprotection, we evaluated the effect of PTCN on the viability of PC12 cells under H2O2 oxidative shock.32 Cytotoxicity tests wereﬁr s tc a r r i e do u to nP T C N .A m o n g the components of PTCN, PB and TF have been approved by the FDA, and CR shows very low cytotoxicity (Figure S12). Cell viability after treatment with PTCN, at all studied concentrations, exceeded 80%, indicating PTCN’sl o w cytotoxicity (Figure S13). Then, H2O2 was used for oxidative shock to construct a cell model of OS. Oxidative shock signiﬁcantly reduced cell viability, with greater effects at higher H2O2 concentrations (Figure 2A). To assess the therapeutic effects of PTCN on cells under oxidative shock, cells were ﬁrst treated with H2O2 and then with PTCN. Cell viability was obviously lower in H2O2-treated cells than in untreated control cells, and the reduction was exacerbated with increasing H2O2 concentrations (Figure 2B). PTCN posttreatment greatly rescued the cell viability, resulting in even higher viability in the posttreatment group than in the control group (Figure 2B), which may have been attributable to the oxygen produced through H2O2 decomposition. To assess the preventive effects of PTCN on oxidative shock in cells, cells were treated with PTCN and then with H2O2. PTCN pretreatment also greatly enhanced cell viability, as the viability was greater in pretreated cells subjected to oxidative shock than in the cells subjected to oxidative shock alone, and the effect increased with increasing PTCN concentration (Figure 2C). These results indicate that PTCN posttreatment and pretreat-ment can effectively rescue cells and prevent the cell death caused by H2O2 oxidative shock, respectively. Then, the effects of PTCN posttreatment and pretreatment on cellular ROS levels and apoptosis under H2O2 oxidative shock were further studied. DCFH-DA staining was performed to measure cellular ROS levels. Unlike the control treatment and PTCN alone, H2O2 treatment caused excess ROS production in cells and resulted in shrunken cellsand decreased numbers of synapses (Figures 2D and 2E). PTCN posttreatment and pretreatment restored the morphology of cells and synapses, while reducing the elevations in ROS levels caused by H2O2 oxidative shock (Figures 2Da n dS14). These results were further demonstrated byﬂow cytometric quantitativeﬂuorescence anal-ysis (Figures 2Ea n dS15). Dual staining with Calcein-AM and propidium io-dide was performed to mark live and dead cells. The results showed that cells were destroyed after H2O2 oxidative shock, while PTCN posttreatment and pretreatment prevented the cells from being damaged (Figure S16). More-over, ﬂow cytometric quantitative apoptosis analysis demonstrated that PTCN posttreatment signiﬁcantly improved the survival rate from 54.6% (un-der H2O2 oxidative shock) to 83.4%; similarly, PTCN pretreatment increased the survival rate to 84.6% (Figure 2F). These results suggest that PTCN pro-vides excellent neuroprotection against oxidative shock for both preventive and therapeutic treatments. Behavioral and hippocampal volume assessment for evaluation of the efﬁcacy of PTCN for AD prevention and therapyin vivo Beforein vivotreatments, the biosafety of PTCN was demonstrated by he-matoxylin and eosin staining (Figure S17) and routine blood analysis (Table S1). Next, we quantitatively analyzed Fe content in the blood of APP/PS1 mice after intravenous injection of PTCN using ICP-MS. As shown inFig-ure S18, we observed high blood Fe content at 0.5 h post-injection and a decrease of only 33% at 48 h post-injection, suggesting that PTCN composed mainly of Fe might have longer blood circulation. On the basis of the brain uti-lization and blood Fe content of PTCN, we designed a gradient dosing strat-egy for the preventive and therapeutic trials with APP/PS1 mice according to the severity of OS in different AD stages (Figures 3Aa n dS19). For the preven-tive trial, APP/PS1 mice at the age of 10 weeks were treated with a low dose of PTCN until 16 weeks and then with a medium dose until 22 weeks, while, for the therapeutic trial, APP/PPS1 mice at the age of 25 weeks were treated with a high dose until 31 weeks. Cognitive behaviors were assessed with a Morris water maze (MWM) test (Figures 3B and 3F). To exclude the possible difference in sensorimotor func-tions between each group, the swimming speed of each group wasﬁrst calculated and no signiﬁcant difference was found among the three groups in both preventive and therapeutic trials (Figure S20). In both the preventive and therapeutic trials, the escape latency of PTCN-treated APP/PS1 mice was signiﬁcantly shorter than that of untreated APP/PS1 mice (Figures 3C and 3G). Remarkably, both PTCN-treated APP/PS1 mice and wild-type (WT) mice showed a preference for the target quadrant, while untreated APP/PS1 mice rarely swam across it (Figures 3D and 3H). Similarly, PTCN treatment signiﬁcantly increased the number of crossings of APP/PS1 mice over the platform in both the preventive and therapeutic trials (Figures 3E and 3I). Then, we evaluated hippocampal volume changes by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since hippocampal atrophy is a recognized biolog-ical marker of AD.33– 35 In both the preventive and therapeutic trials, there were no differences in hippocampal volumes between PTCN-treated APP/ PS1 mice and WT mice, while the volumes in untreated APP/PS1 mice were much smaller than those in WT mice (Figures 3J, 3K, andS21). Overall, these results suggest that, as AD progresses, cognitive impairment gradually worsens, and the impairment is accompanied by pronounced hippocampal atrophy; however, PTCN treatment through an adjustable gradient dosing strategy in the early and late stages of AD can effectively ameliorate cognitive impairments and hippocampal atrophy. Ascertainment of the pathological mechanisms targeted by PTCN antioxidant treatment To further explore the pathological mechanisms targeted by PTCN antiox-idant treatment, pathological changes in the mouse hippocampus were detected monthly during both preventive (Figure 4A) and therapeutic trials (Figure 5A) by western blot analysis. First, lipid peroxidation and DNA oxida-tive damage represented by 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxyguano-sine (8-OHG), respectively, were analyzed to evaluate the alleviation of OS by PTCN. The 4-HNE assay results showed that 4-HNE appeared at 10 weeks in APP/PS1 mice and that the levels gradually increased (Figure 4A); however, the levels were slightly reduced after PTCN treatment in the preventive trial (Figure 4B). Notably, the levels of 4-HNE were higher in the older APP/PS1 mice than in the younger mice (Figure 5A) and were signiﬁcantly reduced by PTCN treatment in the therapeutic trial (Figure 5B). The 8-OHG results showed that, during the preventive trial, a difference in 8-OHG level between APP/PS1 mice and WT mice appeared at 10 weeks, but the difference was gradually eliminated by PTCN treatment (Figures 4A and 4B). During the ther-apeutic trial, the 8-OHG level in APP/PS1 mice was quite high and was also greatly reduced by PTCN treatment to reach the same level as that in WT mice (Figures 5A and 5B). These results indicated that lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidative damage occurred at the beginning of the AD process and were gradually aggravated. PTCN treatment more effectively alleviated DNA oxidative damage than lipid peroxidation in the early stage of AD, while it alleviated both in the late stage of AD. Next, we investigated other AD-related pathological changes that have been reported to interact with OS, including Ab aggregates,36 mitochon-drial dysfunction,37,38 inﬂammation,39 synaptic damage,40 and neuronal apoptosis.41 PTCN treatment slightly but nonsigniﬁcantly reduced Ab aggre-gates (Figures 4A, 4B,5A, and 5B) in APP/PS1 mice. Given the apparent im-provements in cognitive behavior and hippocampal volume, Ab is very likely not the primary cause of cognitive impairments in AD, which is consistent with the fact that most clinical drugs for Ab have failed. Obvious increases in dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) levels and decreases in mitofusin 2 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV levels were observed from 10 to 32 weeks in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction (Figures 4Aa n d5A). PTCN treatment regulated the levels of mitochondrial function markers to close to normal levels, except for DRP1 (Figures 4Ca n d5C). The continuous activation of astrocytes and microglia as well as the increased levels of inﬂammatory cytokines in APP/PS1 mice indicated severe inﬂammation(Figures 4Aa n d5A). Notably, PTCN treatment markedly inhibited microglial activation and reduced inﬂammatory cytokine levels in the preventive trial but only slightly inhibited microglial activation and reduced inﬂammatory cytokine levels in the therapeutic trial (Figures 4D, 4E, 5D and 5E). Marked synaptic damage represented by decreased levels of synapsin 1 and postsynaptic density protein 95 was observed in APP/PS1 mice (Figures 4Aa n d5A). As expected, continued deterioration was restrained by PTCN treatment in both the preventive and therapeutic trials (Figures 4Fa n d5F). Neuronal apoptosis was abnormal at 10 weeks in APP/PS1 mice, as characterized by increased levels of P53 and caspase-3 and decreased levels of BCL-2 (Figures 4Aa n d5A). In the preventive trial, P53 and caspase-3 levels were downregulated nonsigniﬁcantly, while BCL-2l e v e l sw e r es i g n iﬁcantly upregulated after PTCN treatment (Figure 4G). In the therapeutic trial, the upregulation of BCL-2 as well as downregulation of P53 and caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly observed after PTCN treatment (Fig-ure 5G). So the mechanisms by which PTCN treatment attenuated neuronal death in the preventive trial and the therapeutic trial were considered to be different. Overall, PTCN counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction and synap-tic damage during the entire process of AD. In the early stage of AD, PTCN also signiﬁcantly inhibited inﬂammation and mildly inhibited neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, in the late stage of AD, PTCN weakly reduced inﬂam-mation but signiﬁcantly enhanced apoptosis inhibition. These results demonstrate that PTCN administration via a gradient dosing strategy can effectively and continuously attenuate oxidative damage throughout different AD stages, thus attenuating other AD-related pathological mecha-nisms to varying degrees. Theseﬁndings suggest that PTCN is a promising multitarget drug for both preventive and therapeutic treatments of AD."

ABSTRACT: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health challenge, with its prevalence expected to rise dramatically in 
the coming years. The amyloid hypothesis suggests that amyloid beta (Aβ) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD, causing 
neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of 
AD, with emphasis on the role of Aβ. Diagnostic criteria for AD have evolved to include clinical biomarkers such as brain amyloid 
markers detected by positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Emerging research suggests that 
retinal hyperspectral imaging may be a promising non-invasive biomarker of brain Aβ status. While current therapeutic options 
for AD are primarily focused on symptomatic relief, there is growing interest in disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) aimed 
at modulating Aβ pathology to alter the disease trajectory. Aducanumab, the first FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy 
for AD, represents a significant breakthrough in this regard. Other monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ, such as Donanemab, 
Lecanemab, and Gantenerumab, are currently being studied in clinical trials. The integration of novel diagnostic approaches and 
disease-modifying therapies targeting Aβ pathology holds the promise of improving patient outcomes and reducing the societal 
burden of AD.

� Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (named after the German psychiatrist 
Alois Alzheimer), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a 
complex neurological disorder characterized by progressive 
cognitive decline. As of 2020, there are approximately 50 mil-
lion AD patients worldwide, which is expected to double every 
20 years to reach 152 million by 2050. AD also imposes a sig-
nificant economic burden, with annual global costs estimated 
at 1 trillion USD. The multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s 
disease, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, 
complicates its prevention and diagnosis. Regarding the cur-
rently unclear pathogenesis of AD, two hypotheses have been 
proposed: the cholinergic hypothesis and the amyloid hypoth-
esis.
1 The ‘amyloid hypothesis’ states that amyloid beta (Aβ), a 
polypeptide derived from incorrect proteolytic cleavage in the 
brain, plays an important role in the origin and progression of 
the neurodegenerative disease.
Pathologically, AD is associated with Aβ deposition, sub-
sequent formation of amyloid plaques outside neurons, and 
the intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau 
proteins. Both abnormalities have been observed to induce 
neuronal apoptosis and ultimately lead to dementia,
2,3 although 
the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Aβ deposition is typi-
cally followed by synaptic dysfunction, tau protein abnormality 
in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain structural changes, and 
cognitive decline.
3,4 The accumulation of Aβ is asymptomatic 
and begins in the early stages of AD. 2 Recognizing Aβ as a 
potential biomarker for AD, many studies have been conduct-
ed to distinguish AD from normal individuals and to predict 
the progression or onset of AD by monitoring Aβ. The use 
of biomarkers for early diagnosis in preclinical stages or mild 
cognitive impairment holds promise to prevent or delay the 
progression of AD.
3,5
Current advances in positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging using Aβ-selective tracers have great utility in con-
firming the clinical diagnosis of the disease.
6 Since there is a 
substantial delay between the onset of cognitive impairment 
and the diagnosis of AD typically,
7,8 there is a strong need for 
practical, non-invasive, and cost-effective biomarkers to iden-
tify individuals at risk for AD.
9
Current therapeutic options for AD are limited to medi-
cations that provide modest symptomatic improvement. As 
the amyloid beta(Aβ) is central to pathogenesis, Aβ-targeted 
immunotherapy has become a focus of attention as a putative 
disease-modifying treatment for AD.
10
This review provides an overview of recent research findings 
on brain Aβ biomarkers and Aβ-directed immunotherapies 
in the context of AD diagnosis and treatment. This article 
highlights promising avenues to improve AD diagnostic ac-
cessibility and disease management by summarizing the latest 
findings.
� Discussion
Amyloid beta pathology in AD:
The pathological characteristics of AD are linked to Aβ 
deposition, amyloid plaque formation outside neurons, and the 
accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein within neu-
rons. These proteins are known to induce neuronal apoptosis 
and ultimately lead to dementia.
2,3 The accumulation of Aβ 
starts in the early stages of the disease when no symptoms are

present.3 Studies incorporate early biomarkers to distinguish 
AD from normal individuals in an attempt to predict the pro-
gression or onset of AD from mild cognitive impairment or 
preclinical stages and to prevent disease progression.
3,5
Found in the brain of patients with AD, Aβ is a peptide 
of 36-43 amino acids and becomes neurotoxic when it forms 
plaques. Aβ originates from amyloid precursor protein (APP), 
a transmembrane glycoprotein abundant in the central nervous 
system (CNS). APP is processed by two alternative pathways: 
the non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways. The 
non-amyloidogenic path is a natural APP metabolism pro-
cess that precludes Aβ formation. First, APP is cleaved by 
α-secretase within the Aβ domain, generating soluble α-APP 
fragments (sAPPα) and C-terminal fragment α (CTFα, C83); 
C83 is then cleaved by γ-secretase, which produces non-tox-
ic P3 and AICD fragments. In the amyloidogenic pathway, 
APP is firstly cleaved by β-secretase, producing soluble β-APP 
fragments (sAPPβ) and C-terminal β fragments (CTFβ, C99). 
Subsequently, C99 is cleaved by γ-secretase, generating APP 
intracellular domain (AICD), and Aβ.
11,12 Aβ is converted to 
amyloid fibrils via a nucleation reaction, accumulating and co-
agulating.
3,13 Amyloid plaques, consisting primarily of amyloid 
fibrils, are surrounded by axons, dendrites, reactive astrocytes, 
and activated microglia. Notably, Aβ is not confined solely to 
the amyloid plaques but can also be detected in cortical arter-
ies, CFS, plasma, and neuronal culture.
3,14 Amyloid plaques are 
classified by density and structure into diffuse plaques, with 
low fibril content,
15 and neuritic plaques, with high fibril con-
tent; the latter is considered a more significant indicator of 
AD.
3,16
Advancements in AD Diagnosis: Criteria and Biomarkers:
Patients suspected of having AD should undergo multiple 
examinations, including neurological examination, neuronal 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), laboratory tests such as 
vitamin B12, and other tests, in addition to the patient's med-
ical and family history.
1,17
In 1984, The National Institute of Neurological and 
Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the 
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association 
(ADRDA) established clinical diagnostic criteria for Alz-
heimer’s disease. The criteria consist of three categories: (1) 
Probable Alzheimer’s disease, characterized by dementia con-
firmed through neuropsychological tests, progressive memory 
loss, impaired daily activities, and symptoms such as aphasia 
(speech disorder), apraxia (movement disorder), and agnosia 
(loss of perception), typically appearing between ages 40 and 
90 in the absence of other systemic or brain diseases; (2) Pos-
sible Alzheimer’s disease, applied when no other neurological 
or psychiatric disorders are present, although another illness 
(e.g., systemic or brain disorder) may exist but is not the pri-
mary cause of dementia; and (3) Definite Alzheimer’s disease, 
confirmed through histopathological examination, such as a 
biopsy or autopsy.
1,18,19
In 2011, the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Dis-
ease Association updated the 1984 NINMCDS-ADRDA 
criteria with several modifications to improve the specificity 
and sensitivity of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. In addition 
to clinical biomarkers, the newly proposed criteria include 
possible AD dementia with pathophysiological evidence for 
research purposes. There are two categories of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease biomarkers: (a) markers of brain amyloid such as positron 
emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 
and (b) markers of neuronal injury like cerebrospinal fluid tau, 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for metabolic activity, and magnet-
ic resonance imaging (MRI) for atrophy measurement.
1, 20-22
Although a definitive diagnosis of AD can only be made 
postmortem, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's 
Association (NIA-AA) 2018 published a gold standard for in 
vivo diagnosis of AD in research. These include the AT(N) 
biomarker grouping, which encompasses amyloid (A) and tau 
(T) pathology, identified either through CSF assay or PET ,
and neuronal injury (N) evidenced by MRI, PET , or CSF.

Exploring Retinal Biomarkers for Brain Amyloid Beta in 
AD:
The accumulation of Aβ in the brain is a hallmark feature of 
AD.6,23,24 Advances in positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging using Aβ-selective tracers have been extremely useful 
in confirming the clinical diagnosis of this disease. Still, the 
application of this method has been limited by its cost and 
accessibility. Therefore, PET imaging is currently not scalable 
for population screening of individuals at risk for AD.
6
The brain is a hidden central nervous system (CNS) struc-
ture protected from external damage and can only be observed 
in its outer shell with one exception: the retina. Since the ret-
ina and forebrain share the same embryonic origin, they share 
anatomical and functional similarities and common disease 
manifestations.
25 The neural retina is a developmental prod-
uct of the embryonic brain. It contains several molecular and 
cellular features common to the brain, including neurons, glial 
cells, interconnected blood vessels, and a protective blood bar-
rier.
26-30 These features suggest that changes in the retina may 
correspond to changes in the brain, making them potential 
surrogate markers for CNS pathology.
In contrast to the brain, which is largely inaccessible for 
direct imaging, the retina can be easily imaged in vivo using 
optical imaging techniques such as fundus photography (FP), 
optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography 
(OCT-A), Fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy 
(FLIO) and hyperspectral imaging (HIS).
9 These methods 
allow for non-invasive examination of the retina. Hyperspec-
tral imaging measures the intensity of light reflected by tissue 
at multiple wavelengths, providing detailed spectral informa-
tion with better resolution in a shorter processing time. Given 
that Aβ has a wavelength-dependent effect on light scatter-
ing, Xavier Hadoux et al. (2019) investigated the potential for 
in vivo retinal hyperspectral imaging as a biomarker of brain 
Aβ status. There were significant differences in retinal reflec-
tance spectra on PET brain imaging between subjects with 
high Aβ burden and mild cognitive impairment (n=15) and 
age-matched PET negative controls (n=20). Retinal imaging 
findings correlate with brain Aβ load. The results will be ver-
ified using a second hyperspectral camera in an independent 
DOI: 10.36838/v7i2.15

cohort. Similar spectral differences were seen between control 
and 5xFAD transgenic mice, which accumulated Aβ in the 
brain and retina. These results indicate that retinal hyperspec-
tral imaging can predict brain Aβ load.

Recent Developments in AD Treatments: Disease-Modifying 
Treatments:
Six drugs are approved for the treatment of AD, includ-
ing four cholinesterase inhibitors, an N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptor antagonist (Memantine), and an anti-amy-
loid protein-like antibody (Aducanumab).
30 Current treatment 
options for AD are limited to drugs that provide mild symptom 
improvement. However, they do not change the underlying 
course of the disease.
Disease-modifying treatments or therapies (DMT) can 
alter the progression of AD and influence multiple patho-
physiological mechanisms. DMTs, whether immunotherapies 
or small molecule therapies, are administered orally and are 
currently being developed to prevent AD or slow its progres-
sion.
1 These include gamma-secretase inhibitors/modulators 
(e.g., tarenflurbil and semagacestat) and beta-site amyloid 
precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitors (e.g., 
verubecestat, atabecestat, and lanabecestat). Some BACE in-
hibitors have been shown to worsen cognitive performance in 
studies of adverse events such as hepatotoxicity. Monoclonal 
antibodies can be directed against monomeric, oligomeric, or 
plaque amyloid proteins. Several anti-amyloid monoclonal an-
tibodies are currently in clinical trials.
Aducanumab attacks oligomer and plaque amyloid. It is 
the first approved disease-modifying therapy for AD ( June 
7, 2021). Although phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE tri-
als were halted after efficacy and futility analysis suggested 
no benefit, additional data showed that the EMERGE tri-
al had met the primary outcome on the Clinical Dementia 
Rating-Sum of Box (CDR-SB) score with marked plaque 
lowering.
30-32 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) al-
lowed its accelerated approval based on preliminary evidence 
that plaque lowering may predict clinical benefit. The FDA 
required a confirmatory phase 4 trial to produce additional 
evidence of aducanumab’s clinical benefit. The accelerated ap-
proval of monoclonal antibodies has profound implications for 
AD drug development. It is based on biomarkers that predict 
clinical benefits. Aducanumab was approved for its ability to 
reduce plaque amyloid on amyloid PET . Other monoclonal 
antibodies such as donanemab, lacanemab, and gantenerumab 
are currently in clinical trials for AD.
31
In the phase 3 study of lecanemab, the change from baseline 
in CDR-SB score (the primary endpoint) was less for lecanem-
ab than for placebo at 18 months, which favored lecanemab. 
Results for secondary clinical endpoints were identical to those 
for the primary endpoint. Lecanemab exhibits high selectivi-
ty for soluble aggregated Aβ species and moderate selectivity 
for fibrillar amyloid compared with monomeric amyloid; this 
spectrum is thought to target the most toxic pathological amy-
loid species.
31,33-37 After 18 months of treatment in the amyloid 
substudy, the mean amyloid level of 22.99 centiloids in the 
lecanemab group was below the amyloid positivity threshold 
of approximately 30 centiloids, above which participants are 
considered to have elevated Brain amyloid levels. In cerebro-
spinal fluid substudy and overall population plasma analyses, 
reductions in markers of amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration, and 
neuroinflammation (plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein) were 
greater in the lecanemab group compared with placebo, except 
for NFL, which is less sensitive than other markers of neu-
rodegeneration and has a slower time course of change than 
other markers.

� Conclusion
This review encompasses recent literature on AD diag-
nosis and treatment, with a specific focus on the role of Aβ. 
Limitations include the complexity of AD pathogenesis and 
the evolving nature of diagnostic criteria and therapeutic 
approaches. Although this article aims to provide a compre-
hensive overview, it may not capture all recent developments 
in the field.
AD presents a multifaceted etiology, with factors such as 
genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and lifestyle 
factors contributing to disease development. The amyloid 
hypothesis emphasizes the role of Aβ aggregation in form-
ing amyloid plaques, the classic pathological feature of AD. 
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Aβ aggregation 
is critical for developing targeted diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies. Although the landmark Alzheimer’s paper by Syl-
vain Lesné et al. (2006) had to be retracted recently due to 
the usage of manipulated images, the Aβ hypothesis has been 
supported by many independent studies and is still considered 
a compelling approach to AD.
39
Recent advances in AD diagnosis include the incorpora-
tion of clinical biomarkers, such as brain amyloid markers, 
into diagnostic criteria. Retinal hyperspectral imaging holds 
promise as a non-invasive biomarker of brain Aβ status and 
offers potential advantages over existing imaging modalities. 
Aducanumab, the first FDA-approved disease-modifying 
therapy for AD, targets Aβ pathology and represents a sig-
nificant advancement in AD treatment. Other monoclonal 
antibodies targeting Aβ, such as Donanemab, Lacanemab, and 
Gantenerumab, show promise in ongoing clinical trials.
Retinal hyperspectral imaging offers a promising avenue for 
predicting brain Aβ burden. This non-invasive, cost-effective 
method may be used for population screening of individuals 
at risk of AD instead of PET , which is cheaper and more ac-
cessible.
While current therapeutic options for AD primarily target 
symptomatic relief, ongoing research into disease-modifying 
treatments (DMTs), either immunotherapies or small mol-
ecules, is being developed to prevent AD or decrease its 
progression.
1 Aducanumab is the first DMT for AD approved 
by the FDA ( June 7, 2021), targeting oligomeric and plaque 
amyloid proteins. The approval was based on its ability to re-
duce plaque amyloid in amyloid PET .
Other monoclonal antibodies, such as donatumumab, laca-
nezumab, and gantenumab, are currently in clinical trials for 
AD. Lecanemab exhibits high selectivity for soluble aggre-
gated Aβ species and moderate selectivity for fibrillar amyloid

Advances in the research of Aβ as an AD biomarker offer 
great promise for improving the prognosis and quality of life 
of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperspectral im-
aging as a means of monitoring amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, 
coupled with developing disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) 
targeted explicitly at modulating Aβ pathology to alter disease 
progression, can potentially mitigate the associated severe con-
sequences, including social and economic impacts.

ijhighschoolresearch.org ","The article discusses advancements in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) through non-invasive methods, specifically focusing on hyperspectral imaging of the retina. It highlights how this technique can serve as a potential biomarker for AD by evaluating brain amyloid beta status. The research underscores the importance of early diagnosis to mitigate cognitive decline and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, it mentions that aducanumab, an amyloid-targeting drug, showed clinical benefits associated with lowering amyloid levels in patients. The article also notes the significance of timely and accurate diagnosis in primary care settings, emphasizing the need for practical recommendations to address delayed assessments at memory clinics.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health challenge, with its prevalence expected to rise dramatically in the coming years. The amyloid hypothesis suggests that amyloid beta (Aβ) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD, causing neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of AD, with emphasis on the role of Aβ. Diagnostic criteria for AD have evolved to include clinical biomarkers such as brain amyloid markers detected by positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Emerging research suggests that retinal hyperspectral imaging may be a promising non-invasive biomarker of brain Aβ status. While current therapeutic options for AD are primarily focused on symptomatic relief, there is growing interest in disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) aimed at modulating Aβ pathology to alter the disease trajectory. Aducanumab, the first FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy for AD, represents a significant breakthrough in this regard. Other monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ, such as Donanemab, Lecanemab, and Gantenerumab, are currently being studied in clinical trials. The integration of novel diagnostic approaches and disease-modifying therapies targeting Aβ pathology holds the promise of improving patient outcomes and reducing the societal burden of AD.","Alzheimer’s disease (named after the German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a complex neurological disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. As of 2020, there are approximately 50 million AD patients worldwide, which is expected to double every 20 years to reach 152 million by 2050. AD also imposes a significant economic burden, with annual global costs estimated at 1 trillion USD. The multifactorial nature of Alzheimer’s disease, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, complicates its prevention and diagnosis. Regarding the currently unclear pathogenesis of AD, two hypotheses have been proposed: the cholinergic hypothesis and the amyloid hypothesis.1 The ‘amyloid hypothesis’ states that amyloid beta (Aβ), a polypeptide derived from incorrect proteolytic cleavage in the brain, plays an important role in the origin and progression of the neurodegenerative disease. Pathologically, AD is associated with Aβ deposition, subsequent formation of amyloid plaques outside neurons, and the intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Both abnormalities have been observed to induce neuronal apoptosis and ultimately lead to dementia,2,3 although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Aβ deposition is typically followed by synaptic dysfunction, tau protein abnormality in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain structural changes, and cognitive decline.3,4 The accumulation of Aβ is asymptomatic and begins in the early stages of AD. 2 Recognizing Aβ as a potential biomarker for AD, many studies have been conducted to distinguish AD from normal individuals and to predict the progression or onset of AD by monitoring Aβ. The use of biomarkers for early diagnosis in preclinical stages or mild cognitive impairment holds promise to prevent or delay the progression of AD.3,5 Current advances in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using Aβ-selective tracers have great utility in confirming the clinical diagnosis of the disease.6 Since there is a substantial delay between the onset of cognitive impairment and the diagnosis of AD typically,7,8 there is a strong need for practical, non-invasive, and cost-effective biomarkers to identify individuals at risk for AD.9 Current therapeutic options for AD are limited to medications that provide modest symptomatic improvement. As the amyloid beta(Aβ) is central to pathogenesis, Aβ-targeted immunotherapy has become a focus of attention as a putative disease-modifying treatment for AD.10 This review provides an overview of recent research findings on brain Aβ biomarkers and Aβ-directed immunotherapies in the context of AD diagnosis and treatment. This article highlights promising avenues to improve AD diagnostic accessibility and disease management by summarizing the latest findings.",

Mechanism of quercetin 
therapeutic targets for Alzheimer 
disease and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus
Guoxiu Zu1, Keyun Sun1, Ling Li1, Xiuli Zu2, Tao Han3* & Hailiang Huang4*
Quercetin has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic 
activities, suggesting therapeutic potential against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD). In this study, potential molecular targets of quercetin were first identified using the 
Swiss Target Prediction platform and pathogenic targets of T2DM and AD were identified using online 
Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM), DisGeNET, TTD, DrugBank, and GeneCards databases. The 95 
targets shared among quercetin, T2DM, and AD were used to establish a protein–protein interaction 
(PPI) network, top 25 core genes, and protein functional modules using MCODE. Metascape was then 
used for gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment 
analysis. A protein functional module with best score was obtained from the PPI network using 
CytoHubba, and 6 high-probability quercetin targets (AKT1, JUN, MAPK, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR) 
were confirmed by docking simulations. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out according to 
the molecular docking results. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the major shared 
mechanisms for T2DM and AD include “AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications,” 
“pathways in cancer,” and “MAPK signaling pathway” (the key pathway). We speculate that quercetin 
may have therapeutic applications in T2DM and AD by targeting MAPK signaling, providing a 
theoretical foundation for future clinical research.
According to the 2017 global burden of disease study, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD) are the sixth and tenth leading causes of premature death  worldwide1, and many studies have found strong 
epidemiological, pathological, and clinical associations between T2DM and  AD2. The incidence of AD is about 
twofold greater in T2DM patients than in non-diabetic individuals, while a disproportionate number of AD 
patients have a history of early or clinical diabetes. Diabetes and AD also share numerous common risk factors, 
including metabolic disease (obesity), cardiovascular disease, older age, and progressive insulin  resistance2, as 
well as common pathogenic processes such as chronic hyperglycemia, tissue amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and 
toxicity, cellular oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation.
Indeed, the term “type 3 diabetes” has been proposed to describe AD based on the hypothesis that AD-
associated dementia is caused in part by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin-like growth factor signaling 
in the  brain3. It is believed that endocrine and metabolic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose due 
to insulin resistance and death of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β-cells can lead to chronic cardiovascular 
diseases and ultimately to AD. Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the accumulation of Aβ in the brain 
parenchyma (termed senile plaques, SPs) and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the intermediate filament 
protein tau within neurons, forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The presence of these inclusions results in 
synaptic loss, particularly in neocortex and hippocampus, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, ultimately 
leading to neuronal dysfunction and  death4. Tau protein and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) deposits 
are also found in the pancreatic islets of T2DM patients. Moreover, pharmacological studies have shown that 
some traditional hypoglycemic drugs can slow the progression of  AD4.

While there is strong evidence for an association between T2DM and AD at multiple levels, the seminal 
molecular mechanisms linking these disorders remain unknown. One potential strategy for identifying these 
molecular linkage pathways is to screen for common drug targets, which would also provide new possibilities 
for the treatment of T2DM and AD.
Quercetin (3, 3′, 4′, 5, 7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a natural polyhydroxyflavonoid found in the flowers, leaves, 
and fruits of edible plants such as onion, apple, lettuce, and  cabbage4. In addition, many Chinese herbal medi -
cines such as Sophora japonica, Ginkgo biloba leaves, Hypericum perforatum, and cortex moutan are enriched 
in  quercetin5. Numerous studies have documented bioactivities of quercetin relevant to T2DM and AD pathol-
ogy, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic effects. Quercetin has also been 
shown to reduce blood glucose concentration and preserve islet function, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell numbers 
in diabetic model rats and  mice6,7.
At present, there is no broadly effective drug treatment to delay AD onset, slow progression, or improve 
 outcome8, and the few approved mediations can only transiently improve  symptoms9. Also, many synthetic drugs 
with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and (or) hypolipidemic activities induce adverse events 
that preclude clinical use. The use of natural substances to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and 
metabolic diseases such as T2DM is a promising alternative as such agents are often easily and inexpensively 
isolated and have well documented biomechanisms and safety profiles. Y ao et al. conducted a cross-sectional 
study of nearly 20,000  people10. The results show that there is a significant negative correlation between dietary 
quercetin intake and the prevalence of T2DM in Chinese population, which suggests that dietary quercetin intake 
may play a positive role in the prevention and treatment of T2DM, such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, 
blood sugar and blood lipid. At the same time, it is supported by  experiments7, Supplementation of quercetin 
can reduce the blood glucose concentration and promote islet in diabetic rats. β Cell recovery and increased 
insulin release. Quercetin has insulin sensitizing effect. Long term low-dose dietary supplementation can reduce 
insulin resistance (IR) 6 in diabetic mice. Quercetin and its glycosides have extensive neuroprotective effects 
against AD, and its mechanism mainly includes interference β-the formation and deposition of starch protein 
can inhibit the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein to intervene the disease development process of AD. It can 
play a protective role on nerve cells through anti-inflammatory response, antioxidant stress and inhibition of 
apoptosis. In addition, it also has estrogen like effect on nerve cells. In recent years, the estrogen like neuro-
protective effect of quercetin has attracted more and more attention. Epidemiology found that the probability 
of ad in postmenopausal women is much higher than that in men, suggesting that estrogen reduction is a risk 
factor for AD, and estrogen replacement therapy may prevent and delay the occurrence of AD. Quercetin has 
also shown anti-dementia and neuroprotective efficacies in models of dementia/AD and ischemia–reperfusion 
injury by mitigating neuronal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and by improving calcium homeostasis, 
growth factor signaling, and neuroplasticity, ultimately preventing neuronal  apoptosis11–15. Further, a number 
of large double-blind clinical studies have demonstrated that quercetin can reduce the composite end-point of 
death in patients with T2DM and AD. In the present study, we used a systematic bioinformatics approach (net-
work pharmacology) and molecular docking simulations to identify quercetin-binding targets that may also be 
potential therapeutic targets for AD and T2DM.
Materials and methods
Screening of potential quercetin targets. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology 
and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) was used to search for preparations with “quercetin” as a key word, and results 
were then combined with the Chinese Medicine Encyclopedia database (ETCM) to find Chinese herbal medi-
cines enriched in quercetin. Quercetin targets were then identified using the PubChem database with “quercetin” 
as the key word. Based on the notion that drugs of similar structure will have common (overlapping) targets, five 
potential targets of quercetin were predicted using Swiss Target Prediction (http:// www. swiss targe tpred iction. 
ch/)16 with species “Homo sapiens” and a probability > 0.1 as the selection criteria. Target names were standard-
ized according to Uniprot protein database terminology (https:// www. unipr ot. org/)17.
Screening of quercetin targets for T2DM and AD treatment. Pathogenic molecules contributing to 
T2DM and AD was screened using Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM, https:// omim. org/)18 TTD 
(http:// db. idrbl ab. net/ ttd/), DisGeNET (https:// www. disge net. org/), DrugBank (https:// www. drugb ank. ca/)19, 
and GeneCards (https:// www. genec ards. org/)20 using the terms “Type 2 diabetes mellitus” and “ Alzheimer’s 
Disease. ” By intersecting quercetin targets with disease-associated molecules targets using a Venn diagram, we 
obtained targets potentially relevant to T2DM and AD treatment. Cytoscape  software21 was then used to map the 
component–target–disease network as described in detail below.
Construction of protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. To identify interaction targets of 
quercetin potentially relevant to T2DM and AD pathology and treatment, we used the online drawing tool 
Interactive Venn (http:// www. inter activ enn. net/)22 to construct a Venn diagram. The overlapping targets were 
then uploaded to the STRING11.0 platform (https:// string- db. org/)23 to obtain a protein–protein interaction 
(PPI) network. The maximal clique centrality (MMC) algorithm in the CytoHubba plug-in was used for com-
prehensive analysis of network topology to obtain the top 25 hub  genes23. Then  MCODE24, a cluster analysis 
plug-in for Cytoscape3.6.0 (https:// cytos cape. org/), was utilized to further analyze the PPI network. The targets 
in the protein functional module with best MCODE score were selected as core targets for further molecular 
docking simulations. 3

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
Enrichment analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using Metascape (https:// metas  cape. org/)25, 
with p < 0.01 as the cutoff criterion. The top 10 GO items and top 20 KEGG pathways that meet this criterion 
were visualized using OmicShare (http:// www. omics hare. com/) and microscopic letter (http:// www. bioin forma 
tics. com. cn).
Construction of a component–target–pathway network. Cytoscape3.6.0 was used to construct a 
component–target–pathway network based on KEGG enrichment analysis, and the topological parameters of 
the network were analyzed using the built-in Network Analyzer tool.
Molecular docking verification. The PDB formats of the core target proteins were downloaded from 
the RCSB PDB database (http:// www. rcsb. org/). We used PyMol 2.4 software to remove water molecules and 
separate the original ligand from the core target protein, and then imported the processed protein targets into 
AutoDock Tools 1.5.6  software26 for hydrogenation, calculation of total charge, and setting the atomic type. 
Results were saved in “pdbqt” format. The mol2 structures of the core targets were downloaded from the TCMSP 
database, and AutoDock Tools was used to set the rotatable bonds. Files were again saved in “pdbqt” format and 
then imported to AutoDock Vina to perform molecular docking. Finally, PyMol software was used to visualize 
the docking results and establish the docking interaction pattern.
Molecular dynamics simulation. Amber14 was used for molecular dynamics simulation. Amber-99sb 
force field was used for protein system, gaff force field was used for quercetin molecule, TIP3P water molecule 
model and periodic boundary were used. All systems were first optimized, temperature rise and equilibrium, 
and then 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out by sander. Take the trajectory of 10–50 ns and 
calculate the binding energy between quercetin and protein using mm/pbsa.py. Analyze the trajectory using the 
cpptraj module in ambertools. A flowchart of the network pharmacology study is shown in Fig. 1.
Results
Candidate quercetin targets for T2DM and AD treatment. After screening the literature and 
online databases, we identified 263 candidate gene products potentially targeted by quercetin. Screening for 
T2DM pathogenic targets retrieved 30 genes from OMIM, 175 from TTD, one from DisGeNET (with relevance 
score > 0.1), 266 from DrugBank, and 1108 from GeneCards (relevance score > 1). For AD, we retrieved 9 gene 
products from OMIM, 143 from TTD, 218 from DisGeNET, 67 from DrugBank, and 2712 from GeneCards. 
After removing duplicates, 1294 T2DM-related and 2865 AD-related genes were included in subsequent analy-
ses. To obtain quercetin targets with relevance to T2DM and AD pathology and treatment, we constructed a 
Venn diagram, and a total of 95 overlapping targets were obtained (Fig. 2).
PPI network of quercetin targets for T2DM and AD treatment. To estimate the contributions 
of these candidate common targets to disease and reveal the interactive effects, all 95 were imported into the 
STRING database with highest confidence set at 0.9 to obtain a PPI network. The PPI network results were saved 
in TSV text format and imported into Cytoscape3.6.0 for network topology analysis to identify the top 25 targets 
(arranged in descending order of relevance as a concentric circle in Fig. 3A). The PPI network (Fig. 3B) includes 
273 edges among the 95 nodes (circles), where edge thickness represents the interaction strength. To further 
refine the list of quercetin targets relevant to T2DM and AD treatment, we conduct cluster analysis on the PPI 
network based on shared mechanisms using MCODE. This analysis yielded a function module of five key nodal 
proteins (Fig. 3C). It is generally believed that proteins in such functional modules are more closely related and 
may interact to perform specific biological functions. Therefore, these proteins may have important regulatory 
effects on T2DM and AD.
Possible molecular targets of quercetin and associated regulatory signaling pathways rele -
vant to T2DM and AD treatment. We further conducted GO functional analysis and KEGG pathway 
enrichment  analysis27–29 to elucidate the biological effects of quercetin targets and related signaling pathways rel-

evant to T2DM and AD treatment. The top 10 GO items was selected based on p values (Fig. 4). Similarly, the top 
20 KEGG pathway items were selected based on p values (Fig. 5A) and arranged according to category (Fig. 5B).
The common targets were enriched in molecules with GO molecular function terms “cytokine receptor 
binding, ” “serine hydrolase activity, ” “oxidoreductase activity, ” “protein kinase binding, ” and “antioxidant activ-
ity, ” biological processes terms “positive regulation of cell apoptosis” (GO:0097190, GO:0010942, GO:0008285), 
“regulation of inflammatory response” (GO:0050727), “regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process” 
(GO:0072593), “cellular response to external stimulus” (GO:0071496), and “regulation of protein serine/threo-
nine kinase activity” (GO:0071900), and cellular components terms “membrane raft, ” “external side of plasma 
membrane, ” “extracellular matrix, ” “vesicle lumen, ” “endoplasmic reticulum lumen, ” “cell body, ” “receptor, ” “peri-
nuclear region of cytoplasm, ” “actin-based cell projection, ” and “apical part of cell. ” According to KEGG pathway 
enrichment analysis, most of these common targets are involved in “MAPK signaling pathway, ” “TNF signaling 
pathway, ” “ AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, ” “pathways in cancer, ” “proteoglycans in 
cancer, ” “interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, ” “hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling pathway, ” “PI3K-Akt 
signaling pathway, ” “EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, ” “Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, ” “NF-kappa 
B signaling pathway, ” “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ” “VEGF signaling pathway, ” and (or) “ Alzheimer’s 
disease. ” Thus, the common targets of quercetin, T2DM, and AD are strongly enriched in “MAPK signaling 
pathway” components as indicated by four of the MCODE nodes (Fig. 3C) and two of the top 10 GO molecular 
function items. In addition, most of the biological processes items are associated with MAPK activity, such as 
“kinase activity regulation, ” “cell proliferation, ” and “apoptosis, ” suggesting that the MAPK signaling pathway is 
the core quercetin target relevant to T2DM and AD treatment.
Component-target-pathway network construction. A component-target-pathway network was con-
structed based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using Cytoscape3.6.0 (Fig. 6) in which the importance of 
a given node is indicated by the number of connections to other nodes. The average degree of importance (aver-
age number of connection to a given node) was 8.64, and there were 11 targets with degrees higher than 8.64: 
MAPK1 (degree = 18), AKT1 (degree = 15), PIK3R1 (degree = 14), IL6 (degree = 13), PRKCB (degree = 12), TNF 
(degree = 12), VEGFA (degree = 11), EGFR (degree = 11), CASP3 (degree = 10), BCL2 (degree = 9), and IL1B

(degree = 9). Since MAPK1, AKT1, and EGFR were also included in the best scoring protein functional module, 
we speculate that these may be the key targets of quercetin for T2DM and AD treatment.
Molecular docking results analysis. Finally, the interactions with core proteins in the PPI, MCODE, 
and component-target-pathway networks were verified by molecular docking simulations. The most likely and 
stable molecular interactions are generally those with lower energy after binding. Six core molecules were tested 
in docking simulations (Table 1 and Fig.  7), and all showed good binding affinity with an average free energy 
change of − 6.47 kcal/mol. For the quercetin–MAPK1 docking model, the small molecule ligand dapagliflozin 
potentially fit into the interface pocket formed by interacting amino acid residues in the protein. As shown in 
Fig. 7, a hydrogen bond was formed between quercetin and V AL302, HIS297, HIS139, and LYS205 near the 
active site of MAPK1.

Molecular dynamics simulation results. After molecular docking, three proteins with good binding 
were selected according to the docking results, and the sander module in amber was used for 50 ns molecu-
lar dynamics simulation to analyze the stability of the system. The binding energy data of quercetin molecule 
and target protein were obtained by mm/GBSA calculation. After 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation, the 
structures of MAPK1 and TNF proteins are relatively stable, and JUN protein has certain structural changes. 
It is speculated that it is mainly due to the combination of JUN and DNA double strand in the original crystal 
structure to form a complex. This simulation only studies the combination of JUN and quercetin molecules, and 
deletes the DNA double strand, resulting in certain structural changes in the region where JUN binds to DNA.
On the whole, the binding of quercetin to the three proteins was relatively stable, and remained at the pre -
dicted binding site of molecular docking in the process of molecular dynamics simulation. Only certain confor-
mational changes were observed in TNF system. The binding energies of quercetin molecule and three target 
proteins were further calculated by mm/GBSA method. The results showed that the binding energy between 
quercetin and TNF was the strongest, in fact MAPK1, followed by JUN. below is the binding energy (Table  2) 
and molecular dynamics simulation diagram (Fig. 8).

Discussion
Type 2 diabetes is the third most common non-infectious disease in the world. It is characterized by poor blood 
glucose control due to insulin resistance and progression apoptotic death of insulin-producing islet β-cells30. As

T2DM progresses, the loss of insulin production creates an absolute insulin deficiency that can only be addressed 
by exogenous replacement. Therefore, enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing β-cell apoptosis are the ultimate 
strategies for the prevention and treatment of  T2DM31. Several studies have found that quercetin can reduce 
blood glucose, peripheral insulin resistance, and indicators of oxidative stress induced by high glucose in rats, a 
response profile similar to the widely used antidiabetic drug metformin.
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Clinically, it is characterized by pro-
gressive cognitive impairment, memory loss, and marked changes in personality and behavior. The two primary 
hypotheses proposed to explain the progressive neurodegeneration and neurological impairments of AD are 
cytotoxic β-amyloid deposition (plaque formation) due to abnormal processing and hyperphosphorylation of 
tau as these are the pathological hallmarks of the AD brain. In turn, these plaques and NFTs may cause oxidative 
stress and inflammation, leading to synaptic failure, neuronal apoptosis (especially basal forebrain cholinergic 
neurons and various hippocampal and cortical neurons), and brain  atrophy32,33. These pathomechanisms are 
not mutually exclusive and indeed may interact, creating pathogenic cascades. Thus, many protein signaling 
pathways and gene regulation pathways may contribute to the pathological changes in AD.
Many natural components found in traditional herbal preparations have documented antioxidant, anti-
inflammatory, antidiabetic, and anti-apoptotic activities, suggesting potential utility for AD and T2DM treatment. 
For instance, quercetin can improve insulin production by rat insulinoma INS-1 cells in response to high glucose, 
as well as downregulate the relative expression levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and PDX-1 mRNAs, inhibit oxidative 
stress caused by  H2O2, and reduce INS-1 cell  apoptosis34. Quercetin can also clear reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
and reactive nitrogen species and inhibit the level of low density lipoprotein peroxidase, thereby reducing the 
incidence of cardiovascular  disease35. Further, quercetin was shown to reduce ischemic injury and peroxynitrate 
injury by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase and xanthine dehydrogenase  activities36.
The current study revealed several potential molecular mechanisms for AD and T2DM as well as possible 
treatment targets by combining network pharmacology with molecular docking. By integrating and collating 
information from several databases, we identified 95 potential quercetin targets involved in T2DM and AD 
pathology, and further defined a potential protein functional module of five proteins and 25 core genes from the 
PPI network. The biological processes mediated by these functional module proteins include protein kinase sign-
aling and cell proliferation, consistent with pathogenic pathways of T2DM and AD identified in previous studies.
CytoHubba and MCODE identified AKT1, JUN, MAPK, TNF , VEGFA, and EGFR as core targets of quercetin 
that may contribute to AD and T2DM. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is anti-apoptotic, and AKT1 inhibits 
Akt phosphorylation (activation), which in turn upregulates the activity of GSK3β, a kinase implicated in the 
pathogenesis of both T2DM and AD. JUN is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family 
implicated in the onset, progression, and reversal of vascular diseases through modulation of vascular cell pro-
tein expression, proliferation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Downregulation of JUN can significantly reduce 
the expression of inflammatory factors and inhibit endothelial cell  apoptosis37. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is 
a multifunctional cytokine that can directly damage islet β-cells and induce insulin resistance by inhibiting the 
transduction of insulin signals. MAPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in cell proliferation, differ-
entiation, apoptosis, and inflammatory  responses38. Activation of MAPK can also increase tau phosphorylation 
in  neurons39, while inhibition of MAPK expression in hippocampus can significantly improve memory, cognitive 
function, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal  metabolism40. Suppression of MAPK can also improve insulin resist-
ance by upregulating the expression of the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT-4 in striatal muscle 
and adipose tissue, and by enhancing the sensitivity of insulin receptors, thereby promoting the absorption and 
utilization of glucose. Therefore, MAPK may be a core target for the treatment of T2DM and  AD41.

To better understand the interactions among these target genes, we conducted GO and KEGG pathway 
analyses. The target genes were mainly related to cell apoptosis, regulation of inflammatory response, regula-
tion of ROS, metallic process, and other biological processes. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that 
target proteins are involved in the MAPK, TNF , HIF-1, IL-17, PI3K, NF-kappa B, Toll-like receptor, and VEGF 
signaling pathways, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans 
in cancer, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, and Alzheimer’s 
disease. We hypothesize that quercetin may play a therapeutic role in T2DM and AD through the regulation of 
these pathways, but especially through modulation of MAPK signaling (Fig.  9).
A variety of extracellular signaling molecules (growth factors, neurotransmitters, cytokines, hormones, etc.) 
stimulate MAPK signaling via the MAPKKK–MAPKK cascade, ultimately regulating both cytoplasmic processes 
and gene expression pathways underlying cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress responses. Three 
parallel MAPK signaling pathways are found in mammalian cells, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Inhibiting MAPK 
signaling can reduce oxidative stress and ensure the normal proliferation, differentiation, and insulin secretion 
capacity of islet  cells42. Further, inhibition of the MAPK pathway can improve learning and  memory43 and sup-
press apoptosis of hippocampal CA1 neurons by downregulating the transcription factor c-Fos. Activation of the 
MAPK/ERK pathway may be an important mechanism underlying early and medium-term cognitive impair -
ment in rats, while inhibition can reduce damage and promote the repair of damaged neurons. Quercetin acts on 
membrane EGFRs and TNFR1 by promoting the release of VEGFA and TNF , thereby affecting the activation of 
Ras, Raf, MEK, and phosphorylation of MAPK1 and MAPK3, leading to changes in angiogenesis, cell apoptosis, 
and cell proliferation. More in-depth studies on these mechanisms and preclinical studies in T2DM and AD 
animal models are warranted to provide a foundation for future clinical studies targeting the MAPK signaling 
pathway as a novel therapeutic strategy for T2DM and AD.
In conclusion, we have identified several potential molecular mechanisms by which quercetin can simultane-
ously interfere with T2DM and AD progression. Among these, suppression of MAPK signaling appears to be 
the most promoting strategy for the treatment of T2DM and AD.

© The Author(s) 2021 ","The study investigates potential mechanisms of quercetin against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Utilizing bioinformatics tools, it identifies common target proteins between T2DM and AD. The research suggests that quercetin could exert therapeutic effects by targeting these shared pathways. Key findings include the involvement of inflammation, oxidative stress, and specific protein kinases in both diseases. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of p38 MAPK inhibition for improving synaptic plasticity and memory in T2DM models. The work was supported by grants from the Shandong Province key program and the Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.","Quercetin has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic activities, suggesting therapeutic potential against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this study, potential molecular targets of quercetin were first identified using the Swiss Target Prediction platform and pathogenic targets of T2DM and AD were identified using online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM), DisGeNET, TTD, DrugBank, and GeneCards databases. The 95 targets shared among quercetin, T2DM, and AD were used to establish a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, top 25 core genes, and protein functional modules using MCODE. Metascape was then used for gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. A protein functional module with best score was obtained from the PPI network using CytoHubba, and 6 high-probability quercetin targets (AKT1, JUN, MAPK, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR) were confirmed by docking simulations. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out according to the molecular docking results. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the major shared mechanisms for T2DM and AD include “AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications,” “pathways in cancer,” and “MAPK signaling pathway” (the key pathway). We speculate that quercetin may have therapeutic applications in T2DM and AD by targeting MAPK signaling, providing a theoretical foundation for future clinical research.","According to the 2017 global burden of disease study, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are the sixth and tenth leading causes of premature death worldwide1, and many studies have found strong epidemiological, pathological, and clinical associations between T2DM and AD2. The incidence of AD is about twofold greater in T2DM patients than in non-diabetic individuals, while a disproportionate number of AD patients have a history of early or clinical diabetes. Diabetes and AD also share numerous common risk factors, including metabolic disease (obesity), cardiovascular disease, older age, and progressive insulin resistance2, as well as common pathogenic processes such as chronic hyperglycemia, tissue amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and toxicity, cellular oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. Indeed, the term “type 3 diabetes” has been proposed to describe AD based on the hypothesis that AD-associated dementia is caused in part by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin-like growth factor signaling in the brain3. It is believed that endocrine and metabolic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose due to insulin resistance and death of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β-cells can lead to chronic cardiovascular diseases and ultimately to AD. Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the accumulation of Aβ in the brain parenchyma (termed senile plaques, SPs) and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the intermediate filament protein tau within neurons, forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The presence of these inclusions results in synaptic loss, particularly in neocortex and hippocampus, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to neuronal dysfunction and death4. Tau protein and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) deposits are also found in the pancreatic islets of T2DM patients. Moreover, pharmacological studies have shown that some traditional hypoglycemic drugs can slow the progression of AD4. While there is strong evidence for an association between T2DM and AD at multiple levels, the seminal molecular mechanisms linking these disorders remain unknown. One potential strategy for identifying these molecular linkage pathways is to screen for common drug targets, which would also provide new possibilities for the treatment of T2DM and AD. Quercetin (3, 3′, 4′, 5, 7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a natural polyhydroxyflavonoid found in the flowers, leaves, and fruits of edible plants such as onion, apple, lettuce, and cabbage4. In addition, many Chinese herbal medicines such as Sophora japonica, Ginkgo biloba leaves, Hypericum perforatum, and cortex moutan are enriched in quercetin5. Numerous studies have documented bioactivities of quercetin relevant to T2DM and AD pathology, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic effects. Quercetin has also been shown to reduce blood glucose concentration and preserve islet function, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell numbers in diabetic model rats and mice6,7. At present, there is no broadly effective drug treatment to delay AD onset, slow progression, or improve outcome8, and the few approved mediations can only transiently improve symptoms9. Also, many synthetic drugs with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and (or) hypolipidemic activities induce adverse events that preclude clinical use. The use of natural substances to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and metabolic diseases such as T2DM is a promising alternative as such agents are often easily and inexpensively isolated and have well documented biomechanisms and safety profiles. Yao et al. conducted a cross-sectional study of nearly 20,000 people10. The results show that there is a significant negative correlation between dietary quercetin intake and the prevalence of T2DM in Chinese population, which suggests that dietary quercetin intake may play a positive role in the prevention and treatment of T2DM, such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, blood sugar and blood lipid. At the same time, it is supported by experiments7, Supplementation of quercetin can reduce the blood glucose concentration and promote islet in diabetic rats. β Cell recovery and increased insulin release. Quercetin has insulin sensitizing effect. Long term low-dose dietary supplementation can reduce insulin resistance (IR) 6 in diabetic mice. Quercetin and its glycosides have extensive neuroprotective effects against AD, and its mechanism mainly includes interference β-the formation and deposition of starch protein can inhibit the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein to intervene the disease development process of AD. It can play a protective role on nerve cells through anti-inflammatory response, antioxidant stress and inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, it also has estrogen like effect on nerve cells. In recent years, the estrogen like neuroprotective effect of quercetin has attracted more and more attention. Epidemiology found that the probability of ad in postmenopausal women is much higher than that in men, suggesting that estrogen reduction is a risk factor for AD, and estrogen replacement therapy may prevent and delay the occurrence of AD. Quercetin has also shown anti-dementia and neuroprotective efficacies in models of dementia/AD and ischemia–reperfusion injury by mitigating neuronal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and by improving calcium homeostasis, growth factor signaling, and neuroplasticity, ultimately preventing neuronal apoptosis11–15. Further, a number of large double-blind clinical studies have demonstrated that quercetin can reduce the composite end-point of death in patients with T2DM and AD. In the present study, we used a systematic bioinformatics approach (network pharmacology) and molecular docking simulations to identify quercetin-binding targets that may also be potential therapeutic targets for AD and T2DM.","Candidate quercetin targets for T2DM and AD treatment. After screening the literature and online databases, we identified 263 candidate gene products potentially targeted by quercetin. Screening for T2DM pathogenic targets retrieved 30 genes from OMIM, 175 from TTD, one from DisGeNET (with relevance score > 0.1), 266 from DrugBank, and 1108 from GeneCards (relevance score > 1). For AD, we retrieved 9 gene products from OMIM, 143 from TTD, 218 from DisGeNET, 67 from DrugBank, and 2712 from GeneCards. After removing duplicates, 1294 T2DM-related and 2865 AD-related genes were included in subsequent analyses. To obtain quercetin targets with relevance to T2DM and AD pathology and treatment, we constructed a Venn diagram, and a total of 95 overlapping targets were obtained (Fig. 2). PPI network of quercetin targets for T2DM and AD treatment. To estimate the contributions of these candidate common targets to disease and reveal the interactive effects, all 95 were imported into the STRING database with highest confidence set at 0.9 to obtain a PPI network. The PPI network results were saved in TSV text format and imported into Cytoscape3.6.0 for network topology analysis to identify the top 25 targets (arranged in descending order of relevance as a concentric circle in Fig. 3A). The PPI network (Fig. 3B) includes 273 edges among the 95 nodes (circles), where edge thickness represents the interaction strength. To further refine the list of quercetin targets relevant to T2DM and AD treatment, we conduct cluster analysis on the PPI network based on shared mechanisms using MCODE. This analysis yielded a function module of five key nodal proteins (Fig. 3C). It is generally believed that proteins in such functional modules are more closely related and may interact to perform specific biological functions. Therefore, these proteins may have important regulatory effects on T2DM and AD. Possible molecular targets of quercetin and associated regulatory signaling pathways relevant to T2DM and AD treatment. We further conducted GO functional analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis27–29 to elucidate the biological effects of quercetin targets and related signaling pathways relevant to T2DM and AD treatment. The top 10 GO items was selected based on p values (Fig. 4). Similarly, the top 20 KEGG pathway items were selected based on p values (Fig. 5A) and arranged according to category (Fig. 5B). The common targets were enriched in molecules with GO molecular function terms “cytokine receptor binding, ” “serine hydrolase activity, ” “oxidoreductase activity, ” “protein kinase binding, ” and “antioxidant activity, ” biological processes terms “positive regulation of cell apoptosis” (GO:0097190, GO:0010942, GO:0008285), “regulation of inflammatory response” (GO:0050727), “regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process” (GO:0072593), “cellular response to external stimulus” (GO:0071496), and “regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity” (GO:0071900), and cellular components terms “membrane raft, ” “external side of plasma membrane, ” “extracellular matrix, ” “vesicle lumen, ” “endoplasmic reticulum lumen, ” “cell body, ” “receptor, ” “perinuclear region of cytoplasm, ” “actin-based cell projection, ” and “apical part of cell. ” According to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, most of these common targets are involved in “MAPK signaling pathway, ” “TNF signaling pathway, ” “ AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, ” “pathways in cancer, ” “proteoglycans in cancer, ” “interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, ” “hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling pathway, ” “PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ” “EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, ” “Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, ” “NF-kappa B signaling pathway, ” “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ” “VEGF signaling pathway, ” and (or) “ Alzheimer’s disease. ” Thus, the common targets of quercetin, T2DM, and AD are strongly enriched in “MAPK signaling pathway” components as indicated by four of the MCODE nodes (Fig. 3C) and two of the top 10 GO molecular function items. In addition, most of the biological processes items are associated with MAPK activity, such as “kinase activity regulation, ” “cell proliferation, ” and “apoptosis, ” suggesting that the MAPK signaling pathway is the core quercetin target relevant to T2DM and AD treatment. Component-target-pathway network construction. A component-target-pathway network was constructed based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using Cytoscape3.6.0 (Fig. 6) in which the importance of a given node is indicated by the number of connections to other nodes. The average degree of importance (average number of connection to a given node) was 8.64, and there were 11 targets with degrees higher than 8.64: MAPK1 (degree = 18), AKT1 (degree = 15), PIK3R1 (degree = 14), IL6 (degree = 13), PRKCB (degree = 12), TNF (degree = 12), VEGFA (degree = 11), EGFR (degree = 11), CASP3 (degree = 10), BCL2 (degree = 9), and IL1B (degree = 9). Since MAPK1, AKT1, and EGFR were also included in the best scoring protein functional module, we speculate that these may be the key targets of quercetin for T2DM and AD treatment. Molecular docking results analysis. Finally, the interactions with core proteins in the PPI, MCODE, and component-target-pathway networks were verified by molecular docking simulations. The most likely and stable molecular interactions are generally those with lower energy after binding. Six core molecules were tested in docking simulations (Table 1 and Fig. 7), and all showed good binding affinity with an average free energy change of − 6.47 kcal/mol. For the quercetin–MAPK1 docking model, the small molecule ligand dapagliflozin potentially fit into the interface pocket formed by interacting amino acid residues in the protein. As shown in Fig. 7, a hydrogen bond was formed between quercetin and VAL302, HIS297, HIS139, and LYS205 near the active site of MAPK1. Molecular dynamics simulation results. After molecular docking, three proteins with good binding were selected according to the docking results, and the sander module in amber was used for 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation to analyze the stability of the system. The binding energy data of quercetin molecule and target protein were obtained by mm/GBSA calculation. After 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation, the structures of MAPK1 and TNF proteins are relatively stable, and JUN protein has certain structural changes. It is speculated that it is mainly due to the combination of JUN and DNA double strand in the original crystal structure to form a complex. This simulation only studies the combination of JUN and quercetin molecules, and deletes the DNA double strand, resulting in certain structural changes in the region where JUN binds to DNA. On the whole, the binding of quercetin to the three proteins was relatively stable, and remained at the predicted binding site of molecular docking in the process of molecular dynamics simulation. Only certain conformational changes were observed in TNF system. The binding energies of quercetin molecule and three target proteins were further calculated by mm/GBSA method. The results showed that the binding energy between quercetin and TNF was the strongest, in fact MAPK1, followed by JUN. below is the binding energy (Table 2) and molecular dynamics simulation diagram (Fig. 8)."

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia and
affects nearly 50 million people worldwide. Early stage diagnosis of AD is challenging, and there is
presently no effective treatment for AD. The specific genetic alterations and pathological mechanisms of
the development and progression of dementia remain poorly understood. Therefore, identifying essential
genes and molecular pathways that are associated with this disease’s pathogenesis will help uncover
potential treatments. In an attempt to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular
pathogenesis of AD, we integrated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from six microarray datasets
of AD patients and controls. We identified ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A (ATP6V1A), BCL2
interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4), TOR signaling pathway
regulator-like (TIPRL), and the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOMM70) as upregu-
lated DEGs common to the five datasets. Our analyses revealed that these genes exhibited brain-specific
gene co-expression clustering withOP A1, ITFG1, OXCT1, ATP2A2, MAPK1, CDK14, MAP2K4, YWHAB,
P ARK2, CMAS, HSP A12A, and RGS17. Taking the mean relative expression levels of this geneset in differ-
ent brain regions into account, we found that the frontal cortex (BA9) exhibited significantly (p < 0.05)
higher expression levels of these DEGs, while the hippocampus exhibited the lowest levels. These DEGs
are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation processes, and various pathways involved
in the pathogenesis of AD. Finally , our blood–brain barrier (BBB) predictions using the support vector
machine (SVM) and LiCABEDS algorithm and molecular docking analysis suggested that antrocin is
permeable to the BBB and exhibits robust ligand–receptor interactions with high binding affinities to
CAMK4, TOMM70, and T1PRL. Our results also revealed good predictions for ADMET properties,
drug-likeness, adherence to Lipinskís rules, and no alerts for pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS)
Conclusions: These results suggest a new molecular signature for AD parthenogenesis and antrocin as a
potential therapeutic agent. Further investigation is warranted.

1. Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is characterized by functional impairment, progres-
sive cognitive dysfunction, and memory loss, is the most frequent cause of neurodegen-
erative dementia in aging populations, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide [1].
Worldwide prevalence rates range from 1.0% at 60 years of age to 30–50% by 85 years of
age [2,3]. The etiology of AD is multifactorial and involves complex interactions between
genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors; however, about 70% of the risk is believed to
be genetic [4].
The pathology of AD is irreversible, and early stage diagnosis is paramount to halting
the progression of the disease and avoiding deterioration [5,6]. Major clinical manifestations
of AD and other dementias are mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive
decline (SCD). However, the early detection of AD, SCD, MCI, and other dementias is still
challenging [7,8]. The current diagnostic tools have several limitations and are unable to
detect the disease in its early stages [9].
In addition, there is currently no effective treatment for AD, and presently available
drugs do not modify the disease because they are unable to halt its progression [ 10].
The speciﬁc genetic alterations and pathological mechanisms of the development and
progression of dementia remain poorly understood [11], and research in identifying more-
important genes and molecular pathways associated with AD pathogenesis will help
uncover potential treatments.
Gene expression microarrays are widely used to comprehensively measure the genome-
wide expression proﬁles of clinical samples, aiding in the identiﬁcation of disease-related
genes [12]. Previous studies have investigated gene expression changes in the brain tissues
of patients with AD and other neurodegenerative dementias [13–18]. The public availability
of the results from those studies offers the possibility of analyzing the transcriptomic data
to identify potential drug targets and to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies.
Natural products, particularly medicinal plants, represent the sources of the lead
compounds for therapeutic development [ 19,20]. They are perceived as safer and offer
fewer chances of drug resistance than most conventional therapies, which are limited
by their undesirable side effects and drug resistance. Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) is a
unique fungal species that is found exclusively in Taiwan and is traditionally used by
indigenous herbalists to treat various diseases [ 21]. Among the many phytochemicals
identiﬁed in AC, antrocin is a sesquiterpene lactone with established anti-neoplastic and
immune-modulating functions [22]. Our previous data indicated that antrocin suppresses
several biological signaling pathways, including the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/paxillin
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/c-Fos/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2,
Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β/nuclear
factor (NF)- κB, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transduction and activator of transcription
(STAT3),β-catenin/Notch1/Akt, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R)[23–27].
In addition, the activation of apoptotic markers including Fas, DR5, Bax, caspase–3, –8, and
–9 were also implicated in the pharmacological activities of antrocin; however, whether
antrocin can modulate the gene alterations associated with AD remains unclear.
We analyzed ﬁve AD microarray datasets and identiﬁed ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4,
TIPRL, and TOMM70 as upregulated DEGs that are common in all ﬁve datasets (Figure 1).
These genes covered a wide range of biological pathways related to brain function and
disabilities. Furthermore, our in silico blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability and molecu-
lar docking analysis suggested that antrocin is permeable to the BBB and exhibited robust
ligand–receptor interactions with high binding afﬁnities to CAMK4, TOMM70, and T1PRL,
suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic agent for AD. Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 3 of 21

Docking experiments were performed with AutoDock Vina (vers. 0.8) using default 
settings at a docking exhaustiveness of 8 with all of the bonds in the ligand rotated freely 
while considering the receptors to be rigid. A grid box of 40 × 40 × 40 Å in the X, Y, and Z 
dimensions and a spacing of 1.0 Å were used  [49]. The docked complex was visualized 
and analyzed using the Discovery Studio vi sualizer vers. 19.1.0.18287 (BIOVIA, San 
Diego, CA, USA) [50] and the protein –ligand interaction profiler (https://plip-

2. Methods
2.1. Collection of Microarray Data of Early Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
The microarray AD datasets were collected from the NCBI GEO, a public functional
genomics data repository of high-throughput gene expression data (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/, accessed on 21 September 2021). The ﬁve datasets that we used are described
in Table 1. The GSE26927 (GPL6255 (Illumina humanRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip)
dataset (released on Jan. 29, 2011) consists of the microarray data from postmortem central
nervous system (CNS) tissues of 63 AD patients and 54 control samples [13]. The GSE160208
(GPL29311, NanoString nCounter Human Myeloid Innate Immunity Panel v2) dataset
(released Jan. 8, 2021) consists of gene expression data from the frontal cortex (FC) and
cerebellum (CB) of 27 Creutzfeldt–Jakob diseases (CJD) patients and 20 normal controls
(CT) [14]. The CJD dataset was included in this analysis because both AD and CJD are
conformational disorders that share common clinical, neuropathological, and pathogenetic
mechanisms [28,29]. Unlike typical AD, early onset AD exhibits atypical AD phenotypes
that present high levels of total tau (T-tau) protein and/or positive 14-3-3 protein (p14-3-3)
in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), reﬂecting intense neuronal degeneration similar to what
is found in CJD [ 30]. GSE5281 (GPL570, HG-U133_Plus_2 Affymetrix Human Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 Array) contains 161 samples, 74 of which are non-demented controls and
87 are affected with AD [ 15]. GSE36980 (GPL6244(HuGene-1_0-st) Affymetrix Human
Gene 1.0 ST Array (transcript (gene) version) released Apr. 17, 2013) consists of microarray
data from the gray matter of the frontal and temporal cortices and hippocampi derived
from 80 postmortem brains of 33 AD patients and 47 controls [16]. GSE39420 (GPL11532:
(HuGene-1_1-st) Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST Array (transcript (gene) version) released
on Jan. 20, 2015) consists of microarray data from 14 AD patients and 7 controls [ 17].
The controls were cognitively normal healthy cohorts with no history of AD. No ethics
committee approval or patient consent was required for the present study. Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 4 of 21

2.2. Identiﬁcation of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)
DEGs were identiﬁed using the LIMMA package of R [31]. The Benjamini–Hochberg
correction method was used for the p-value adjustment of the false discovery rate (FDR).
An FDR of < 0.05 and |log[fold change (FC)]| cut off point were set for DEG selection.
The Multiple List Comparator (https://www.molbiotools.com/listcompare.html, accessed
on 21 September 2021), a web tool, was used to visualize the intersecting DEGs and to
generate a Venn diagram to visualize overlapping DEGs. These overlapping DEGs were
used for further bioinformatics analysis to uncover the molecular mechanism of AD.
2.3. Brain-Speciﬁc Gene Co-Expression, Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks, and
Gene-Set-Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of DEGs
We explored the NetworkAnalyst server (https://www.networkanalyst.ca/, accessed
on 21 September 2021) [ 32] to conduct a brain-speciﬁc gene co-expression analysis. In
accordance with the protocol described in previous studies [ 33,34], the DEGs were up-
loaded to the GENELIST module of the server and were analyzed for speciﬁc selected
parameters: organism (Homo sapiens), ID type (gene symbol), tissue-speciﬁc co-expression
(brain) analysis minimum-order network analysis. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathways and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of the DEGs
were conducted using the Enrich server [35,36]. The ofﬁcial gene symbols of the DEGs were
uploaded into the Enrich server and were analyzed for the KEGG and GO terms under
the default enrichment cutoff value of p < 0.05. The search tool for retrieval of interacting
genes/proteins (STRING) server (http://string-db.org/, accessed on 21 September 2021,
v10.5) [37] was used to construct the PPI network of the DEGs. The Entrez gene symbols
of the DEGs were uploaded to the multiple protein modules of the STRING server and
were analyzed for known and predicted PPI interactions in Homo sapiens under the high
conﬁdence (0.70) search and at a signiﬁcant level of p < 0.05.
2.4. Analysis of Gene Disease-Speciﬁc Associations of the DEGs
W e analyzed the disease-specific associations of DEGs by exploring the disease/phenotype-
speciﬁc ﬁlters of the OPENTARGET platform (https://www.targetvalidation.org/, ac-
cessed on 21 September 2021) at a search score of 0.15. The OPENTARGET platform
is a bio-web algorithm that integrates genetic, omic, and chemical data to identify the
involvement of genes in diseases and aids in systematic drug target identiﬁcation and
prioritization [38].
2.5. MicroRNA (miRNA) Regulatory Network Analysis of the DEGs
The miRNA regulatory targets of the DEGs were collected from experimentally veri-
ﬁed databases (TarBase, mir2disease, and miRTarBase) and predicted databases (miRanda
and targetscan). The miRNA regulatory network was visualized using the visNetwork R
packages. In addition, we used the miRNA Enrichment Analysis and Annotation (miEAA)
tool (https://ccb-compute2.cs.uni-saarland.de/mieaa2/, accessed on 21 September 2021)
to conduct a functional enrichment analysis of the miRNA targets [ 39]. Analysis was
conducted using FDR (Benjamini–Hochberg) a p-value adjustment of 0.05 and a minimum
required hit of four miR. Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 5 of 21
2.6. In Silico Evaluation of the Drug-Likeness, Pharmacokinetics (PKs), Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB)
Permeability and Acute Rat Toxicity Study of Antrocin
We analyzed the drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics (PKs), medicinal chemistry, and
toxicity of antrocin using SwissADME software (http://www.swissadme.ch, accessed
on 21 September 2021) [40] and computer-aided Prediction of Biological Activity Spectra
(PASS) web resources (http://way2drug.com/dr, accessed on 21 September 2021) [41]. We
used the blood–brain barrier (BBB) prediction server (https://www.cbligand.org/BBB/,
accessed on 21 September 2021), which operates based on support vector machine (SVM)
and LiCABEDS algorithms on four types of ﬁngerprints from 1593 reported compounds [42]
to analyze the BBB-permeation ability of antrocin. The permeation threshold of the server
is 0.02. In addition, we also used the brain or intestinal estimated permeation method
(BOILED-Egg) model [43] to further analyze the brain- and intestinal-permeation abilities
of the compound based on its lipophilicity and polarity. The antrocin SMILES format was
also uploaded to the SwissADME server and was analysed for the presence of pan-assay
interference compound (PAINS) substructures [44]. The GUSAR software for quantitative
structure-activity relationship (QSAR)/quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR)
modelling was used for the in silico prediction of the 50% lethal dose (LD50) values of
antrocin for rats through four administration routes (intravenous (i.v.), intraperitoneal
(i.p.), oral inhalation, and subcutaneous (s.c.)) [45]. The GUSAR software was developed
based on training datasets from the SYMYX MDL Toxicity Database and consisted of
approximately 104 chemical structures with data on acute rat toxicity represented by LD50
values (log10 (mmol/kg)).
2.7. Molecular Docking Studies
The three-dimensional (3D) structures of CAMK4 (PDB:2W4O), ATP6V1A (PDB:6XBY),
TIPRL (PDB:5WOW), BNIP3 (PDB:2J5D), and TOMM70 (PDB:3FP3) were downloaded
from the protein data bank (PDB). The mol2 ﬁle for the 3D structure of antrocin was ob-
tained using the Avogadro molecular builder and visualization tool vers. 1.XX [46] before
subsequently being transformed into PDB format using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics
System, vers. 1.2r3pre. The PDB ﬁles of the crystal structures of the targets were trans-
formed to pdbqt format using AutoDock Vina (vers. 0.8, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla,
CA, USA) [47]. Prior to molecular docking, the receptors were charged, hydrogen atoms
were added, and water (H2O) molecules were removed [48]. Docking experiments were
performed with AutoDock Vina (vers. 0.8) using default settings at a docking exhaustive-
ness of 8 with all of the bonds in the ligand rotated freely while considering the receptors to
be rigid. A grid box of 40 ×40 ×40 Å in the X, Y, and Z dimensions and a spacing of 1.0 Å
were used [49]. The docked complex was visualized and analyzed using the Discovery
Studio visualizer vers. 19.1.0.18287 (BIOVIA, San Diego, CA, USA) [50] and the protein–
ligand interaction proﬁler (https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de/plip-web/plip/index,
accessed on 21 September 2021) [51].

The ﬂow chart of the study design for the in silico identiﬁcation of the potential targets
for Alzheime’sr disease and antrocin as a therapeutic candidate is shown inFigure 1. To
retrieve the genes whose expression levels were signiﬁcantly altered in AD brains compared
to non-AD brains, we analyzed the transcriptomic data of multiple cohorts from microarray

(Figure 2A). The overexpressed DEGs were identiﬁed from each of the datasets and were
based on an adjusted p < 0.05 when comparing the AD patients and the control subjects
from each dataset (Figure 2B−D). Furthermore, we integrated the overexpressed DEGs
from each dataset to identify overlapping and the most implicated DEGs in AD pathology.

in Brain Regions
To characterize the intracellular localization of the proteins, we acquired the indirect
immunoﬂuorescence data of distributions of the proteins within the nucleus, endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), and microtubules of A-431 and A549 cells. We found that that ATP6V1A,
BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 were colocalized with the markers of different
subcellular localizations: ATP6V1A (cytosol and nucleoplasm), BNIP3 (cytosol), CAMK4 Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 7 of 21
(nucleoplasm), TIPRL (vesicles and cytosol), and TOMM70 (mitochondria) (Figure 3A). In
addition, we examined the expression levels of the DEGs in different regions of the brain.
Taking the mean relative expression levels of these genes in different brain regions into
account, we found that the frontal cortex (BA9) exhibited signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) higher DEG
expression levels. In contrast, the hippocampus exhibited the lowest ATP6V1A, BNIP3,
CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 expression levels compared to the other parts of the brain
that were analyzed (Figure 3B, Table 2).

3.3. MicroRNA (miR) Regulatory Network and Brain-Speciﬁc Gene Interactions of ATP6V1A,
BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70
We conducted a tissue-speciﬁc gene co-expression analysis and found that each of
the DEGs exhibited brain-speciﬁc gene co-expression clustering with 986 clustering nodes
and 1212 clustering edges (Figure 4A). Speciﬁcally, we observed higher clustering co-
expression with optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), integrin alpha FG-GAP repeat containing 1 (ITFG1), Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 8 of 21

G protein signaling 17 (RGS17). Furthermore, the PPI interaction network yielded 45 nodes
and 435 edges, with an average local clustering coefﬁcient of 0.813 and PPI enrichment
p-value of <1.0 ×10−16. The PPI network revealed that TOMM70A and ATP6V1A exhibited
very high protein family-speciﬁc clustering interactions while BNIP3, CAMK4, and TIPRL
formed a very minimal cluster (Figure 4B). We queried the miRNA targets of the DEGs
to gain further insight into their pathological role. We found that DEGs are targeted by
several miR-regulatory networks (Figure 4C) that are signiﬁcantly associated with the
pathogenesis of several CNS diseases including Parkinson’s disease, Down syndrome,
inﬂammation, cerebral infarction, and several other diseases (Figure 5).
3.4. ATP6V1A/BNIP3 and CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 Are Associated with Mitochondrial
Dysfunction, Inﬂammatory Processes, and Various Pathways Involved in AD Pathogenesis
To better understand the most common biological processes and pathways altered
by dementia generation and progression, we analyzed disease associations, KEGG path-
ways, and the ontological enrichment of DEGs. Our results revealed the enrichment
of fatty acid biosynthesis, ferroptosis, long-term potentiation, amphetamine addiction,
adipocytokine signaling, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling,
synaptic vesicle cycling, and peroxisome as major pathways associated with the DEGs
(Figure 6A), while enriched molecular functions in the signatures were mainly associated
with ATPase and calcium-dependent protein kinase activities (Figure 6B). In addition,
biological processes, including the regulation of myeloid leukocyte differentiation, den-
dritic cell cytokine production, myeloid dendritic cell differentiation, cellular response
to oxygen levels, and the mitochondrial protein catabolic process, were signiﬁcantly en-
riched (Table 3). The gene–disease analysis further revealed that the ATP6V1A/BNIP3 and
CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 signatures were associated with several brain-related disorders,
including developmental disabilities, schizophrenia, intellectual disabilities, abnormal
cerebral white matter morphology, and mental retardation (Figure 6C). Collectively, the
ﬁndings from this study suggest that ATP6V1A/BNIP3 and CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 are
associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, inﬂammatory processes, and various pathways
involved in AD pathogenesis.
3.5. In Silico Pharmacokinetics, BBB Permeability and Acute Toxicity of Antrocin
The preclinical evaluation of drug PKs can aid in the drug development process by
providing a rationale for the selection of efﬁcacious drug doses and treatment schedules [52].
The BBB is an important factor that limits the effectiveness of most chemotherapies against
AD. Herein, we evaluated the BBB permeation ability (Figure 7) of antrocin, and our
results revealed a BBB permeability score of 0.038 (Figure 7, Table 4) on a BBB permeant
threshold of 0.02, suggesting that antrocin is BBB permeant and thus would be valuable
for AD treatment. Our results also revealed good predictions for ADMET properties,
drug-likeness, adherence to Lipinskís rules, no PAINS alerts, and that it is a non-inhibitor
of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (Table 5). QSAR modeling of acute toxicity
in rats revealed that antrocin had LD50 values of 618, 26, 804.3, 517.3 g/kg body weight
for the i.p., i.v., o.p, and s.c. administrative routes, respectively (Table 4), suggesting that
the compound has a high safety proﬁle, especially when administered orally. In addition,
antrocin demonstrated high environmental safety, as measured by the bioaccumulation
factor, Daphnia magna, fathead minnow, and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 9 of 21

enriched (Table 3). The gene–disease analysis further revealed that the ATP6V1A/BNIP3 
and CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 signatures were associated with several brain -related

3.6. Molecular Docking Proﬁles of Antrocin with ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL,
and TOMM70
Our molecular docking analysis revealed that antrocin exhibited strong interac-
tions with the crystal structures of CAMK4 (PDB:2W4O), BNIP3 (PDB:2J5D), TIPRL
(PDB:5WOW), TOMM70 (PDB:3FP3), and ATP6V1A (PDB:6XBY) and demonstrated the re-
spective binding afﬁnities of −6.70, −5.80, −6.60, −6.80, and −5.90 kcal/mol. Our analysis
of interactions between the target gene and antrocin revealed that antrocin interacted with
the gene targets through several hydrogen bonds, π-alkyl, van der Waals forces (Table 6),
and several hydrophobic contacts (Table 7).

Antrocin bound to CAMK4 with three hydrogen bonds, including THR291, HIS156,
and PRO220, with the respective binding distances of 2.72, 1.92, and 3.65 Å. In addition,
the antrocin–CAMK4 complex was further stabilized by several van der Waals forces that
were formed around the backbone of antrocin with the amino acid residues of MET224,
GLU221, THR290, PHE292, and ALA153 in the binding cavity of CAMK4. However, only
two hydrophobic contacts (PRO220A and HIS156A) existed between antrocin and the
binding cavity of CAMK4 (Figure 8). Antrocin was bound with TIPRL with three hydrogen
bonds, including THR208, SER173, and PHE254, with the respective binding distances of
2.03, 2.97, and 3.78 Å, with several π-alkyl, van der Waals forces, and various hydrophobic
contacts (Figure 9).
No conventional hydrogen bonds were observed between antrocin and BNIP3, while
only a single hydrogen bond was observed between the ligand (antrocin) and the receptors:
TOMM70 (SER271, 2.40 Å) and ATP6V1A (HIS96, 2.16 Å). In addition, several van der
Waals forces and hydrophobic contacts were also observed between antrocin and the
receptors: BNIP3, TOMM70, and ATP6V1A (Figure 10). Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 14 of 21

4. Discussion
AD, one of the most common types of dementia, afﬂicts millions of people globally. In
addition to its negative effects on physical and mental health, AD places a huge burden on
both individuals and societies [53]. Although a number of medications are available for
the relief of AD symptoms, no cure for AD presently exists [ 54]. Therefore, it is evident
that identifying DEGs that play pivotal roles in AD pathogenesis is an important step
towards the development of appropriate therapeutic strategies. A comparative analysis
of the transcriptomic data between AD subjects and healthy controls revealed important
molecular pathways and biological processes altered by AD generation and progression.
In terms of upregulated genes, our pathway enrichment results included fatty acid
biosynthesis, ferroptosis, long-term potentiation, amphetamine addiction, adipocytokine
signaling, PPAR signaling, synaptic vesicle cycle, and peroxisome, all of which are com-
monly accepted components of the pathogenesis and pathological changes of AD [55–59].
Inﬂammatory processes play fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of AD [60]. Acti-
vated cells strongly produce inﬂammatory mediators such as proinﬂammatory cytokines, Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 16 of 21
chemokines, leukotrienes, reactive oxygen species, and other radicals [61,62]. In addition,
the enrichment of biological processes, including the regulation of myeloid leukocyte
differentiation, dendritic cell cytokine production, myeloid dendritic cell differentiation,
cellular responses to oxygen levels, and the catabolism of mitochondrial proteins, indicate
important factors, all of which are associated with activation of the inﬂammatory processes
involved in the pathogenesis of AD [61,62].
Furthermore, the enrichment of the regulation of myeloid leukocyte differentiation,
the positive regulation of dendritic cell cytokine production, cellular responses to oxygen
levels, and the myeloid dendritic cell differentiation in the biological process ontologies
of DEGs suggest a mitochondrial dysfunction event, which is an important factor in the
pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders such as PD [63]. Collectively,
the ﬁndings from this study suggest that ATP6V1A/BNIP3/CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 are
associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, inﬂammatory processes, and various pathways
involved in AD pathogenesis.
ATP6V1A is a multi-subunit enzyme that is associated with synaptic vesicle proton
gradient generation in the brain, energy metabolism, and ATP synthesis. In agreement with
a previous study [64], our comprehensive analyses of DEGs, enrichment, and PPI networks
strongly suggest that ATP6V1A may play an important role in AD pathogenesis. Moreover,
ATP6V1A maturations were implicated in the onset of developmental encephalopathy
with epilepsy, suggesting its role in regulating neuronal development [65]. A clinical study
by Dutta et al. [66] reported that two patients with de novo mutations (T607I and I554F)
in the C-terminus of the TOM70 protein exhibited white matter abnormalities, hypotonia,
hyperreﬂexia, dystonia, and cognitive deﬁcits.
Furthermore, our brain-speciﬁc gene co-expression analysis revealed that the DEGs
exhibited gene co-expression clustering with OP A1, ITFG1, OXCT1, ATP2A2, MAPK1,
CDK14, MAP2K4, YWHAB, P ARK2, CMAS, HSP A12A, and RGS17, all of which were
reported to play essential roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and AD pathogenesis.
Similar to the results obtained in our analysis, Zhang et al. [64] detected the upregulation
of ATP6V1A and OXCT1 in the AD cohorts compared to in the healthy cohorts [ 64].
Experimental evidence links OP A1to the pathogenesis of Parkinsonian syndrome and
dementia [63], while OXCT1 plays a central role in extrahepatic ketone body catabolism [67].
Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that CAMK4, BNIP3, TIPRL, TOMM70,
and ATP6V1A are important DEGs that are associated with the pathogenesis of AD and
thus serve as attractive targets in the development of therapeutic intervention.
Molecular docking is widely employed as an in silico model for elucidating the
interactions between proteins and ligands and also in the estimation of the binding afﬁnities
of protein–ligand complexes [68,69]. This enables the depiction of the behavior of a drug
candidate within the binding cavity of a receptor and ultimately gives an idea of the
biological processes that could be modulated by the drug candidate [70,71]. Consequently,
we conducted a molecular docking study to elucidate the potential druggability of the
target genes by antrocin, a bioactive natural product. Interestingly, our molecular docking
study suggested that antrocin exhibited strong interactions with the crystal structures of
CAMK4 (PDB:2W4O), BNIP3 (PDB:2J5D), TIPRL (PDB:5WOW), TOMM70 (PDB:3FP3),
and ATP6V1A (PDB:6XBY), with estimated binding afﬁnities of −6.70, −5.80, −6.60, −6.80,
and −5.90 kcal/mol, respectively. Our analysis of the protein–antrocin complexes revealed
that antrocin interacted with the targets created by several hydrogen bonds, π-alkyl, van
der Waals forces, and several hydrophobic contacts. Non-covalent interactions, such as
hydrogen, hydrophobic and ionic bondings, and van der Waals forces, play crucial roles in
stabilizing the interactions between drug candidates and their protein targets [72,73]. The
higher number of interactions that antrocin has with CAMK4, TOMM70, and T1PRL could
be responsible for the stronger afﬁnities that antrocin has for these proteins than it does for
BNIP3 or ATP6V1A. The van der Waals forces created around the antrocin backbone with
the respective amino acids of the proteins would create a strong cohesive environment, Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 17 of 21
which would further stabilize the complexes [74]. However, the lower afﬁnity of antrocin
for BNIP3 could be attributed to the absence of H-bonding in the antrocin–BNIP3 complex.
The BBB is a limiting factor in the therapeutic effects of most medications for treating
AD. Although a number of AD drug treatment trials targeting BBB dynamics have been
conducted, most of them have failed due to inadequate permeability. In addition, a
subset of AD cases with chronic hypoperfusion features is complicated by an inadequate
BBB [75]. Therefore, BBB permeation is an important factor that must be considered in
the development of a new drug for AD. Interestingly, our in silico studies indicated that
antrocin has high BBB permeability potential. Only a small fraction of small molecules cross
the BBB via lipid-mediated free diffusion, and these molecules must have <8 hydrogen
bonds and a molecular weight of < 400 Daltons (Da) [76]. Interestingly, antrocin satisﬁed
these criteria, with a MW of 234.33 Da, a surface area of 26.30 Å2, and forms two hydrogen
bonds. The MW threshold is a property of all biological membranes [ 77]. In agreement
with our ﬁndings, a screening of CNS-acting drugs showed that all brain drugs have an
MW <426 Da [78]. The BBB permeability decreases 100-fold when the surface area of a
drug is increased from 50 Å 2 to 100 Å2 [78], which would be the case when the MW of
a drug increases from 300 Da to 450 Da [ 76]. Antrocin demonstrated good predictions
for ADMET properties, drug-likeness, and adherence to Lipinsk ís rules. The pan-assay
interference compounds (PAINS) are known as substructures of promiscuous molecules
that are responsible to yield false-positive biological activities [44]. No alert was evidenced
for antrocin in the PAINS analysis, suggesting that this compound is non-promiscuous and
hence has potential for use in target therapy [79]. Our results suggest that antrocin is a BBB
permeant drug-like molecule and hence may have translational potential for treating AD
and other brain disorders.
Intestinal absorption and brain penetration are important factors to consider for
therapeutic agents that are intended to treat neurodegenerative diseases in response to oral
exposure [80]. Our results showed that antrocin is predicted to be highly absorbed by the
human gastrointestinal tract. Increasing evidence has revealed that that the p-glycoprotein
(P-gp) efﬂux may interact with drugs and consequently prevent their absorption by actively
repelling them into the lumen of the intestine [ 81]. Our results indicated that antrocin
is not a p-gp substrate, and this could account for the high predicted GIT absorption of
antrocin. In the case of metabolism, various cytochrome P450 isoenzymes were evaluated,
showing that antrocin is not a substrate for metabolism by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6,
and CYP3A4 isoenzymes. In addition to BBB permeability, the high bioavailability of
antrocin (0.55, Table 5) could ultimately favour its accessibility to the brain. Altogether,
our results suggest that the oral administration of antrocin is likely to result in safer
bioavailability and access to the BBB, thus suggesting its potential for AD treatment.
Taken together, the present study strengthened our understanding of the molecular
pathogenesis of AD, identiﬁed disease targets, and suggested the therapeutic potential of
antrocin. The main limitation of our study is the lack of the direct conﬁrmation of these
genes by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, experimental
validation and the detailed therapeutic efﬁcacy of antrocin in an AD animal model is
currently ongoing in our laboratory. In addition, the RT-quantitative (q)PCR validation of
these identiﬁed targets in clinical samples is ongoing.
5. Conclusions
Our ﬁndings identiﬁed a potential new gene signature, ATP6V1A/BNIP3/CAMK4/
TIPRL/TOMM70, as critical molecular markers in mitochondrial dysfunction, inﬂamma-
tory processes, and various pathways participating in AD parthenogenesis. Additionally,
in silico assays and docking experiments revealed that antrocin interacted well with the
crystal structures of the proteins and exhibited a low acute toxicity level based on the in
silico modelling of the various administration routes. Our results suggest the potential of
antrocin in targeting the DEGs; however, further investigation is warranted for the clinical
translation of antrocin to ameliorate and prevent AD. Pharmaceutics 2021, 13, 1555 18 of 21

[CrossRef] ","The article discusses computational approaches and molecular docking studies to identify potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease, focusing on drug delivery challenges. It highlights the role of inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and genetic factors like OPA1 mutations. The study employs network analysis and pathway-based methods to identify hub genes associated with immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Molecular docking is used to assess interactions between NCI anticancer analogues and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit. Computational methods help in understanding the effects of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion on blood-brain barrier permeability. The research also explores the use of isoflavones as potential anticancer agents targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MEK pathways, emphasizing the importance of structural features and target combinations for drug design.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia and affects nearly 50 million people worldwide. Early stage diagnosis of AD is challenging, and there is presently no effective treatment for AD. The specific genetic alterations and pathological mechanisms of the development and progression of dementia remain poorly understood. Therefore, identifying essential genes and molecular pathways that are associated with this disease’s pathogenesis will help uncover potential treatments. In an attempt to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AD, we integrated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from six microarray datasets of AD patients and controls. We identified ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A (ATP6V1A), BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4), TOR signaling pathway regulator-like (TIPRL), and the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOMM70) as upregulated DEGs common to the five datasets. Our analyses revealed that these genes exhibited brain-specific gene co-expression clustering with OPA1, ITFG1, OXCT1, ATP2A2, MAPK1, CDK14, MAP2K4, YWHAB, PARK2, CMAS, HSPA12A, and RGS17. Taking the mean relative expression levels of this geneset in different brain regions into account, we found that the frontal cortex (BA9) exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher expression levels of these DEGs, while the hippocampus exhibited the lowest levels. These DEGs are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation processes, and various pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, our blood–brain barrier (BBB) predictions using the support vector machine (SVM) and LiCABEDS algorithm and molecular docking analysis suggested that antrocin is permeable to the BBB and exhibits robust ligand–receptor interactions with high binding affinities to CAMK4, TOMM70, and T1PRL. Our results also revealed good predictions for ADMET properties, drug-likeness, adherence to Lipinski’s rules, and no alerts for pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) Conclusions: These results suggest a new molecular signature for AD parthenogenesis and antrocin as a potential therapeutic agent. Further investigation is warranted.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is characterized by functional impairment, progressive cognitive dysfunction, and memory loss, is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative dementia in aging populations, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide [1]. Worldwide prevalence rates range from 1.0% at 60 years of age to 30–50% by 85 years of age [2,3]. The etiology of AD is multifactorial and involves complex interactions between genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors; however, about 70% of the risk is believed to be genetic [4]. The pathology of AD is irreversible, and early stage diagnosis is paramount to halting the progression of the disease and avoiding deterioration [5,6]. Major clinical manifestations of AD and other dementias are mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD). However, the early detection of AD, SCD, MCI, and other dementias is still challenging [7,8]. The current diagnostic tools have several limitations and are unable to detect the disease in its early stages [9]. In addition, there is currently no effective treatment for AD, and presently available drugs do not modify the disease because they are unable to halt its progression [10]. The specific genetic alterations and pathological mechanisms of the development and progression of dementia remain poorly understood [11], and research in identifying more-important genes and molecular pathways associated with AD pathogenesis will help uncover potential treatments. Gene expression microarrays are widely used to comprehensively measure the genome-wide expression profiles of clinical samples, aiding in the identification of disease-related genes [12]. Previous studies have investigated gene expression changes in the brain tissues of patients with AD and other neurodegenerative dementias [13–18]. The public availability of the results from those studies offers the possibility of analyzing the transcriptomic data to identify potential drug targets and to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies. Natural products, particularly medicinal plants, represent the sources of the lead compounds for therapeutic development [19,20]. They are perceived as safer and offer fewer chances of drug resistance than most conventional therapies, which are limited by their undesirable side effects and drug resistance. Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) is a unique fungal species that is found exclusively in Taiwan and is traditionally used by indigenous herbalists to treat various diseases [21]. Among the many phytochemicals identified in AC, antrocin is a sesquiterpene lactone with established anti-neoplastic and immune-modulating functions [22]. Our previous data indicated that antrocin suppresses several biological signaling pathways, including the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/paxillin phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/c-Fos/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β/nuclear factor (NF)-κB, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT3), β-catenin/Notch1/Akt, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) [23–27]. In addition, the activation of apoptotic markers including Fas, DR5, Bax, caspase–3, –8, and –9 were also implicated in the pharmacological activities of antrocin; however, whether antrocin can modulate the gene alterations associated with AD remains unclear. We analyzed five AD microarray datasets and identified ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 as upregulated DEGs that are common in all five datasets (Figure 1). These genes covered a wide range of biological pathways related to brain function and disabilities. Furthermore, our in silico blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability and molecular docking analysis suggested that antrocin is permeable to the BBB and exhibited robust ligand–receptor interactions with high binding affinities to CAMK4, TOMM70, and T1PRL, suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic agent for AD.","3. Results 3.1. Deregulated Expressions of ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 Associated with the Pathology of Neurodegenerative Dementia The flow chart of the study design for the in silico identification of the potential targets for Alzheimer’s disease and antrocin as a therapeutic candidate is shown in Figure 1. To retrieve the genes whose expression levels were significantly altered in AD brains compared to non-AD brains, we analyzed the transcriptomic data of multiple cohorts from microarray datasets (Table 1). The DEG distributions for each dataset are shown in a volcano plot (Figure 2A). The overexpressed DEGs were identified from each of the datasets and were based on an adjusted p < 0.05 when comparing the AD patients and the control subjects from each dataset (Figure 2B−D). Furthermore, we integrated the overexpressed DEGs from each dataset to identify overlapping and the most implicated DEGs in AD pathology. Five significantly overexpressed DEGs were identified: ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A (ATP6V1A), BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4), TOR signaling pathway regulator-like (TIPRL), and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOMM70) (Figure 2C). 3.2. ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 Localization and Differential Expressions in Brain Regions To characterize the intracellular localization of the proteins, we acquired the indirect immunofluorescence data of distributions of the proteins within the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and microtubules of A-431 and A549 cells. We found that that ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 were colocalized with the markers of different subcellular localizations: ATP6V1A (cytosol and nucleoplasm), BNIP3 (cytosol), CAMK4 (nucleoplasm), TIPRL (vesicles and cytosol), and TOMM70 (mitochondria) (Figure 3A). In addition, we examined the expression levels of the DEGs in different regions of the brain. Taking the mean relative expression levels of these genes in different brain regions into account, we found that the frontal cortex (BA9) exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher DEG expression levels. In contrast, the hippocampus exhibited the lowest ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 expression levels compared to the other parts of the brain that were analyzed (Figure 3B, Table 2). 3.3. MicroRNA (miR) Regulatory Network and Brain-Specific Gene Interactions of ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 We conducted a tissue-specific gene co-expression analysis and found that each of the DEGs exhibited brain-specific gene co-expression clustering with 986 clustering nodes and 1212 clustering edges (Figure 4A). Specifically, we observed higher clustering co-expression with optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), integrin alpha FG-GAP repeat containing 1 (ITFG1), 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1), ATPase, Ca++ transporting, cardiac muscle, slow twitch 2 (ATP2A2), MAPK1, cyclin dependent kinase 14 (CDK14), MAP2K4, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein beta (YWHAB), parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PARK2), cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (CMAS), heat shock protein family A member 12A (HSPA12A), and regulator of G protein signaling 17 (RGS17). Furthermore, the PPI interaction network yielded 45 nodes and 435 edges, with an average local clustering coefficient of 0.813 and PPI enrichment p-value of <1.0 × 10−16. The PPI network revealed that TOMM70A and ATP6V1A exhibited very high protein family-specific clustering interactions while BNIP3, CAMK4, and TIPRL formed a very minimal cluster (Figure 4B). We queried the miRNA targets of the DEGs to gain further insight into their pathological role. We found that DEGs are targeted by several miR-regulatory networks (Figure 4C) that are significantly associated with the pathogenesis of several CNS diseases including Parkinson’s disease, Down syndrome, inflammation, cerebral infarction, and several other diseases (Figure 5). 3.4. ATP6V1A/BNIP3 and CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 Are Associated with Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Inflammatory Processes, and Various Pathways Involved in AD Pathogenesis To better understand the most common biological processes and pathways altered by dementia generation and progression, we analyzed disease associations, KEGG pathways, and the ontological enrichment of DEGs. Our results revealed the enrichment of fatty acid biosynthesis, ferroptosis, long-term potentiation, amphetamine addiction, adipocytokine signaling, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling, synaptic vesicle cycling, and peroxisome as major pathways associated with the DEGs (Figure 6A), while enriched molecular functions in the signatures were mainly associated with ATPase and calcium-dependent protein kinase activities (Figure 6B). In addition, biological processes, including the regulation of myeloid leukocyte differentiation, dendritic cell cytokine production, myeloid dendritic cell differentiation, cellular response to oxygen levels, and the mitochondrial protein catabolic process, were significantly enriched (Table 3). The gene–disease analysis further revealed that the ATP6V1A/BNIP3 and CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 signatures were associated with several brain-related disorders, including developmental disabilities, schizophrenia, intellectual disabilities, abnormal cerebral white matter morphology, and mental retardation (Figure 6C). Collectively, the findings from this study suggest that ATP6V1A/BNIP3 and CAMK4/TIPRL/TOMM70 are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory processes, and various pathways involved in AD pathogenesis. 3.5. In Silico Pharmacokinetics, BBB Permeability and Acute Toxicity of Antrocin The preclinical evaluation of drug PKs can aid in the drug development process by providing a rationale for the selection of efficacious drug doses and treatment schedules [52]. The BBB is an important factor that limits the effectiveness of most chemotherapies against AD. Herein, we evaluated the BBB permeation ability (Figure 7) of antrocin, and our results revealed a BBB permeability score of 0.038 (Figure 7, Table 4) on a BBB permeant threshold of 0.02, suggesting that antrocin is BBB permeant and thus would be valuable for AD treatment. Our results also revealed good predictions for ADMET properties, drug-likeness, adherence to Lipinski’s rules, no PAINS alerts, and that it is a non-inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (Table 5). QSAR modeling of acute toxicity in rats revealed that antrocin had LD50 values of 618, 26, 804.3, 517.3 g/kg body weight for the i.p., i.v., o.p, and s.c. administrative routes, respectively (Table 4), suggesting that the compound has a high safety profile, especially when administered orally. In addition, antrocin demonstrated high environmental safety, as measured by the bioaccumulation factor, Daphnia magna, fathead minnow, and Tetrahymena pyriformis. 3.6. Molecular Docking Profiles of Antrocin with ATP6V1A, BNIP3, CAMK4, TIPRL, and TOMM70 Our molecular docking analysis revealed that antrocin exhibited strong interactions with the crystal structures of CAMK4 (PDB:2W4O), BNIP3 (PDB:2J5D), TIPRL (PDB:5WOW), TOMM70 (PDB:3FP3), and ATP6V1A (PDB:6XBY) and demonstrated the respective binding affinities of −6.70, −5.80, −6.60, −6.80, and −5.90 kcal/mol. Our analysis of interactions between the target gene and antrocin revealed that antrocin interacted with the gene targets through several hydrogen bonds, π-alkyl, van der Waals forces (Table 6), and several hydrophobic contacts (Table 7). Antrocin bound to CAMK4 with three hydrogen bonds, including THR291, HIS156, and PRO220, with the respective binding distances of 2.72, 1.92, and 3.65 Å. In addition, the antrocin–CAMK4 complex was further stabilized by several van der Waals forces that were formed around the backbone of antrocin with the amino acid residues of MET224, GLU221, THR290, PHE292, and ALA153 in the binding cavity of CAMK4. However, only two hydrophobic contacts (PRO220A and HIS156A) existed between antrocin and the binding cavity of CAMK4 (Figure 8). Antrocin was bound with TIPRL with three hydrogen bonds, including THR208, SER173, and PHE254, with the respective binding distances of 2.03, 2.97, and 3.78 Å, with several π-alkyl, van der Waals forces, and various hydrophobic contacts (Figure 9). No conventional hydrogen bonds were observed between antrocin and BNIP3, while only a single hydrogen bond was observed between the ligand (antrocin) and the receptors: TOMM70 (SER271, 2.40 Å) and ATP6V1A (HIS96, 2.16 Å). In addition, several van der Waals forces and hydrophobic contacts were also observed between antrocin and the receptors: BNIP3, TOMM70, and ATP6V1A (Figure 10)."

without psychosis (AD-P). We sought to determine whether the postsynaptic density (PSD)
proteome is altered in AD+ P relative to AD-P, analyzing PSDs from dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex of AD+ P, AD-P, and a reference group of cognitively normal elderly subjects. The
PSD proteome of AD+ P showed a global shift towards lower levels of all proteins relative to
AD-P, enriched for kinases, proteins regulating Rho GTPases, and other regulators of the
actin cytoskeleton. We computationally identiﬁed potential novel therapies predicted to
reverse the PSD protein signature of AD+ P. Five days of administration of one of these
drugs, the C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 inhibitor, maraviroc, led to a net reversal of the
PSD protein signature in adult mice, nominating it as a novel potential treatment for AD+ P.

1234567890():,; P
sychotic symptoms affect ~40 –60% of individuals with
Alzheimer Disease (AD) 1. AD subjects with psychosis
(AD + P) experience greater cognitive dysfunction early in
disease progression prior to psychosis onset2,3 and more rapid
cognitive decline compared to AD subjects without psychosis
(AD-P)1–4. Current treatments for psychosis in AD with anti-
psychotics have limited efﬁcacy, do not mitigate the more rapid
cognitive decline, and confer excess mortality 5. In addition,
AD + P is associated with worse outcomes than AD-P, including
higher rates of aggression 6, caregiver distress 7, functional
decline8, institutionalization9, and mortality 10. Thus, there is
strong motivation to identify the biology underlying psychosis in
AD in hopes of developing a targeted, more ef ﬁcacious
intervention.
The risk for psychosis in AD is to a large extent genetically
determined, with an estimated heritability of 60%, indicative of a
distinct biologic vulnerability4,11,12. Because it has long been
recognized that synapse loss is the strongest neuropathologic
correlate of cognitive decline in AD13,14, it has been hypothesized
that the vulnerability to AD + P arises from greater synaptic
impairment in AD+ P than AD-P. Prior studies that compared
AD + P to AD-P subjects on a number of correlates of synapse
integrity, including gray matter volumes, cerebral glucose utili-
zation or blood ﬂow, or gray matter concentrations of the
membrane breakdown products, glycerophosphoethanolamine
and glycerophosphocholine, have found support for this
hypothesis across neocortical, but not medial temporal regions
(reviewed in ref. 15). Most recently, we examined gray matter
levels of a limited panel of 190 synaptic proteins in individuals
with AD + P and found reductions in canonical postsynaptic
density (PSD) proteins relative to AD-P subjects
16. These dif-
ferences exceeded those which could be accounted for by any
differences in neuropathology burden between the groups16,o rb y
reductions in the corresponding mRNA transcripts due to greater
excitatory neuron loss in AD+ P17.
None of these prior studies have directly examined the PSD in
AD + P. We therefore conducted a proteomic analysis of PSD
fractions from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of a large group of
individuals with AD+ P and AD- P. To facilitate interpretation
of differences between AD + P and AD-P we also included a
reference group of cognitively normal elderly subjects. We found
a global shift to reduced levels of PSD proteins in AD+ P subjects
relative to both AD-P and cognitively normal subjects. There was
a global shift towards lower levels in PSDs from AD+ P relative
to AD-P subjects, including lower levels of a network of kinases,
proteins regulating Rho GTPases, and proteins regulating the
actin cytoskeleton. Using computational systems pharmacology
we identi ﬁed several currently approved drugs predicted to
reverse the PSD protein level differences between AD+ P and
AD-P. Five days of exposure to one of these drugs, maraviroc, led
to a net reversal of the PSD protein signature in adult mice,
nominating it as a novel potential treatment for AD+ P.
Results
PSD abundance in AD with and without psychosis. Prior to
evaluating the full cohort, we validated our PSD enrichment in a
subset of the AD cases (Fig. S1). To explore whether psychosis
status globally affected the PSD yield in AD, weﬁrst evaluated the
association of AD+ P with total gray matter yield of PSD protein
(Fig. S2). Mean µg PSD/µg of gray matter protein was sig-
niﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P relative to both AD-P and elderly
cognitively normal subjects. The reduction in PSD yield in AD-P
relative to elderly cognitively normal subjects was not signiﬁcant.
PSD protein levels in AD with and without psychosis.W en e x t
evaluated yield-adjusted PSD protein levels, conservatively limiting
our initial analysis to the peptides present in 100% of subjects,
comprising 1,613 proteins (Fig.1). There was a signiﬁcant shift in
abundance of almost all proteins to lower levels in AD+ Pc o m -
pared to AD-P (t=−90.6, df=1612, p <2×1 0−307). We con-
ducted additional analyses to conﬁrm the robustness of this global
shift. The global reduction was similarly present in the larger set of
PSD proteins quantiﬁed using peptides present in≥50% of samples
(Fig. S3a). Similarly, the global reduction of PSD protein levels
persisted when covarying for excitatory neuron proportion, a
measure we previously reported is reduced in AD+ P relative to
AD-P17 (Fig. S3b, c).
No individual protein level was signiﬁcantly reduced with an
adjusted p < 0.05 (Supplementary Data 1). Thus, to characterize
the nature of the broader signal of global reduction, we examined
the 240 most reduced proteins (those with unadjustedp < 0.05).
Functional annotation analysis of these 240 PSD proteins relative
to a background of the 1,613 proteins that were quantiﬁed in
100% of subjects revealed strong enrichment for regulators of the
actin cytoskeleton, a critical determinant of post-synaptic
dendritic spine structure and function (Supplementary Data 2).
These included actin binding proteins and regulators of Rho
GTPase signaling such as Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain
containing Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs)
and Rho GTPase activating proteins (RhoGAPs). Additionally,
Fig. 1 Distribution of levels of 1,613 PSD proteins quantiﬁed in DLPFC
using peptides present in 100% of AD+ P and AD-P subjects.
Distributions of log2 ratios are shown for all proteins, adjusted for
covariates, Age, PMI, Sex,APOE*E4, Lewy Body presence, and phospho-
Tau area fraction. The dashed vertical line represents no difference in the
ratio of protein levels between groups. Black points indicate the 240
proteins with nominally signiﬁcant differences in levels in AD+ P relative to
AD-P (p < 0.05). AD+ P is characterized by a signiﬁcant shift towards
lower PSD protein levels compared to AD-P.

(Supplementary Data 2). These 23 kinases, which are important
regulators of RhoGEFs, RhoGAPs, and actin binding proteins18,
interact within a network that was itself enriched for the
remaining 217 PSD proteins with nominally signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in AD + P (Fig. 2). In addition to kinases, PH domain
containing proteins, and actin binding proteins, the network
included PDZ domain containing proteins and microtubule
binding proteins, suggestive of disrupted signaling to additional
post-synaptic structural elements (Fig. 2b). Choice of a more
liberal threshold for peptide inclusion (e.g., present call≥50%) did
not substantially alter the functional annotation ﬁndings,
although now enrichment for histone proteins also emerged
(Supplementary Data 3).
Comparison of AD + P and AD-P with elderly cognitively
normal subjects. While our focus was on the comparison of
AD + P relative to AD-P, our dataset provided an opportunity to
examine how the PSD is altered in these groups relative to our
reference group of elderly cognitively normal subjects. Both AD
groups were characterized by a signiﬁcant shift towards lower
PSD protein levels compared to cognitively normal reference
group, with greater reductions in AD + P than in AD-P
(Figure S4a–c). As a result, 836/1613 (51.8%) proteins had an
adjusted p < 0.05 in AD+ P in comparison to the reference
group, whereas the corresponding number was 2/1613 (0.001%)
proteins for the AD-P group (Supplementary Data 4). The pro-
tein whose abundance was most altered between the AD and
comparison subjects was APP, due solely to the increased levels of
two peptides found within the Aβ sequence (RHDSGYEVHHQK
and KLVFFAEDVGSNK, Supplementary Data 4 and noted as Aβ
in Fig. S4c). Overall, the protein alterations present in the two AD
groups relative to elderly cognitively normal subjects were highly
correlated (Fig. S4c). As a consequence, both groups showed
enrichment of differentially expressed proteins involved in pro-
tein translation and of glycoproteins. Nevertheless, functional
annotation of the proteins that differentiated AD+ P or AD-P
from reference subjects revealed some differential patterns of
enrichment. PSD proteins that differentiated AD+ P from elderly
cognitively normal subjects included enrichment for proteins
involved in calcium signaling, synaptic function, and cytoskeletal
proteins. PSD proteins that differentiated AD-P from elderly
cognitively normal subjects were enriched for proteins involved in
protein quality control, ion channels, and small GTPases (Sup-
plementary Data 5).
We also undertook to contrast the PSD signature of AD±P
relative to elderly cognitively normal subjects to the most extensive
prior examination of the functional enrichment of proteins in total
gray matter homogenates of individuals with AD and elderly
controls subjects, reported in19. This contrast is summarized in
Fig. S5. The differentially expressed proteins in the PSDs of both
AD +P and AD-P shared with the overall gray matter homogenate
enrichment for ribosomal proteins and glycoproteins. Other gray
matter functional enrichments shared with either AD +P
(Synapse, Mitochondria) or AD-P (Cell-ECM interactions, Ubi-
quitination) may indicate that some of the overall signal detected in
AD homogenate derives primarily from subgroups of individuals
with or without psychosis. Finally, enrichments detected only in the
PSD preparations (e.g. impacting Calcium signaling, ion transport,
and the cytoskeleton) may reﬂect pathologic cascades that are most
prominent within PSDs and not as readily detected in the
multicellular, multicompartmental, gray matter homogenate. As
such, these functions may represent postsynaptic-speciﬁc targets
for intervention for cognitive impairment more generally.
Fig. 2 The interaction network of kinases and proteins nominally differentially expressed (p < 0.05) in PSD of AD+ P relative to AD-P.To explore the
impact of AD+ P on the phosphorylation network, we identiﬁed 23 kinases in the in the functional annotation analysis of the 240 differentially expressed
proteins. We then used String v11.558 to search the interactions between these 23 kinases with the remaining 217 nominally differentially expressed
proteins. We found that 76/217 (35.0%) proteins were reported to interact with the 23 kinase proteins. As a comparison, only 348/1373 (25.2%) of the
non-differentially expressed proteins (deﬁned by AD+ P vs AD-Pp > 0.05) were reported to interact with the 23 kinases (χ2 = 8.97, df= 1, p = 0.0027).

reported genome-wide gene-based tests of association with psy-
chosis in AD11. A total of 239 of the 240 PSD proteins that were
nominally signiﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P had available corre-
sponding gene-based tests of association (Supplementary Data 6,
and Supplemental Materials). Of these 239 genes whose proteins
were assayed, 11 genes which were nominally altered at the
protein level in AD+ P also exhibited at least nominal evidence
of genetic association with AD+ P relative to AD-P. Notable
among these were the actin binding protein genes SYNPO,
SYNE1, ALDOA, and VPS16. Also included were the kinase
PRKCI, and the GAPTBC1D10B.
Predicted drug activity against the AD+ P PSD protein net-
work. We next sought to identify existing pharmacotherapies
with potential abilities to target the disrupted PSD signature
of AD + P. We identiﬁed 50 gene knockout datasets in which
the resulting changes to the transcriptome were correlated with
the PSD protein signature of AD+ P (Supplementary Data 7).
We identiﬁed 46 drugs targeting these genes, 7 of which showed
the desired effect (inhibitor/antagonist or positive regulator)
on the targeted gene (Table1). To further assess, computationally,
the potential post-treatment effect of the nominated drugs on
PSD protein levels in AD + P, two additional analyses were
performed. First, the expression signatures due to knockdown of
the upstream-genes were correlated with only the 240 PSD pro-
teins nominally signiﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P to ensure that
the correlation between the knockdown signature and AD+ P
persisted when examining the most dysregulated proteins. This
analysis identiﬁed thatMTOR had a correlation with the top 240
proteins that were opposite (negative) to its overall correlation
with the 1613 proteins, excluding it, and its positive regulator,
pimecrolimus, from further consideration.
Second, we undertook to validate the gene signatures of the
remaining candidate drugs. Of these, leronlimab, ibalizumab, and
epigallocatechin gallate were not found in the LINCS database for
evaluation of their induced transcriptome expression signatures,
and procaine was not tested in CNS cells. Two of the remaining
three medications, fostamatinib and maraviroc demonstrated
transcriptome expression signatures that were negatively corre-
lated with the AD+ P PSD protein signature (Signed Jaccard
Indexes of −0.0025 and −0.0009, respectively, Supplementary
Data 8).
Effect of maraviroc on the PSD proteome. We looked to con-
ﬁrm our prediction for one of the above drugs, maraviroc, by
testing its effects on the PSD proteome in mice. We administered
either 50 mg/kg maraviroc dissolved in a vehicle solution of 18%
ethanol in normal saline or an equivalent volume of vehicle
solution alone to three-month-old C57Bl/6 J WT mice for 5 days.
We successfully quantiﬁed 1370 of the 1613 proteins that com-
prised our PSD signature of AD+ P, including 201 of the 240
PSD proteins that were nominally signi ﬁcantly reduced in
AD + P. Maraviroc treatment had a net effect of increasing PSD
protein abundance, with a more marked effect in the subset of
201 proteins most disrupted in AD+ P (Fig. 3, Supplementary
Data 9). The Signed Jaccard Index was−0.01186 for maraviroc’s
effect on the AD+ P PSD proteome signature.
Discussion
We hypothesized that AD+ P arises from a more severe synap-
topathy than that which is present in AD-P, based on multiple
studies that have compared indirect measures of synapse integrity
both in vivo and in postmortem tissue, between AD+ P and AD-
P groups
15. In the current report we provide a direct comparison
of the PSD proteomes between AD + P and AD-P subjects,
ﬁnding a shift to reduced levels of multiple proteins in the PSD of
AD + P. Relative to AD-P, PSDs from AD+ P subjects had lower
levels of protein kinases which participate in a network that is
also enriched for proteins with nominally signiﬁcantly reduced
levels in AD + P and for functions implicated in signaling to
post-synaptic structural elements. The PSD protein reductions in
AD + P relative to AD-P were not accounted for by the altered
burden of neuropathologies or the greater reduction in excitatory
neurons that we have previously reported in AD+ P relative to
AD-P. We were then able computationally identify several novel
drug treatments predicted to reverse the PSD proteome signature
of AD + P, and conﬁrm that at least one of them, maraviroc,
could reverse this signature in mouse cortex after short-term
systemic administration.
Given the prominent role post-synaptic regulation of the actin
cytoskeleton plays in the maintenance and plasticity of dendritic
spines18, it is not surprising that the PSD proteome of AD+ P
was selectively depleted of proteins enriched for functions asso-
ciated with actin regulation. The identiﬁcation of impairments of
this signaling network provides an opportunity for identifying
compounds that might have speci ﬁc therapeutic bene ﬁts for
individuals with AD+ P. We used a novel computational strat-
egy, examining the overlap of gene knockout signatures with the
AD + P PSD proteome alterations to identify upstream genes
amenable to perturbation by existing compounds to potentially
reverse the PSD proteome alterations in AD+ P. We were able to
conﬁrm this prediction for maraviroc, which generated a net
reversal of the PSD proteome reductions present in AD+ Pi na

Jaccard Index, showed a substantially larger effect in the PSD
proteome ( −0.01186) than that which was calculated using
mRNA alterations induced by maraviroc in cultured neurons
(−0.0009). The Signed Jaccard Index for the PSD proteome effect
was similar to to the mean Signed Jaccard Index of−0.03264 that
we reported for drugs indicated for treatment of CNS disease
20.
While our computational prediction was conﬁrmed for mar-
aviroc, several caveats persist. Our validation was conducted in
adult wildtype mice. Further tests in mouse models expressing
AD-associated pathologies are warranted. Although there is no
deﬁnitive mouse model for psychosis in AD21, the PSD proteome
signature of at least some models of Aβ overproduction overlap
with that of AD+ P16. Even if maraviroc’s effects are further
conﬁrmed in AD models, a number of limitations may arise when
repurposing a drug developed for treating other conditions. For
example, any medication used will be applied to frail elderly
individuals with multiple comorbidities, so preferred agents
would be documented to be well-tolerated in such a population.
Maraviroc, which was developed for chronic treatment of HIV
infection, may well meet this tolerability benchmark, as might one
of the other medications we identiﬁed, fostamatinib, which was
developed for chronic use in populations with serious auto-
immune disease22,23. Finally, we note that our conﬁrmation for
maraviroc need not hold true for the other identiﬁed compounds,
which will require independent validation in intact neural model
systems to evaluate their effects on the PSD.
Nevertheless, our strategy identiﬁed several genes that could
represent novel targets for addressing the synaptic impairments
in AD+ P. For example, actin rod formation in neurons, which is
promoted by agonism of the C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5
(CCR5), the target of maraviroc, has been increasingly recognized
as a component of Alzheimer’s neuropathology that induces PSD
loss24,25. Likewise, treatment with maraviroc improved cognition
in a small study of individuals with HIV-associated neurocogni-
tive disorder
26. Aurora Kinase B (AURKB), the target by which
fostamatinib was identiﬁed as a drug of potential beneﬁt for
AD + P, has recently been shown to play a role in promoting
neurite formation during early neuronal development27 and to
promote axonal repair after injury in post-mitotic neurons28.
Additionally, we identiﬁed reductions in levels of group of
protein kinases that interact with a network that also includes
other altered PSD proteins which serve to regulate the cytoske-
leton. The roles of many of these kinases in the synaptic plasticity
processes that regulate the maintenance of dendritic spines is well
established (e.g. CAMK2A29, LIMK130, typical31 and atypical32
PRKCs, TRIO33). Of interest, one of the atypical PRKCs, PRKCI,
while not itself established as having a role in spine maintenance,
was among the genes identiﬁed as nominally signiﬁcantly asso-
ciated with AD+ P (Supplementary Data 6). We also identiﬁed
TBK1, a kinase that when disrupted causes frontotemporal
dementia/ALS and induces dendritic spine loss in animal
models34. Albeit, whether TBK1 has a normative role in spine
maintenance is not established. It is likely that not just PSD
protein levels of these kinases, but their phosphorylation-
dependent activation, and the extent of phosphorylation of
their downstream targets, are altered in the PSD of AD + P
relative to AD-P. Thus, an important future direction will be to
delineate the phosphoproteome signature of the AD+ P PSD.
Such an investigation may both help to nominate candidate
therapies directly targeting the altered kinases and may provide
another metric to assess the therapeutic potential of other drug
candidates.
We report theﬁrst study, to our knowledge, to directly inter-
rogate the PSD in AD+ P. The abundance of numerous PSD
proteins was reduced in AD + P relative to both AD-P and
comparison subjects. Examination of the PSD proteome signature
of AD+ P, relative to AD-P, revealed lower levels of an inter-
acting set of protein kinases, regulators of Rho GTPases, and
other protein regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. We were able to
use the PSD protein signature of AD + P to computationally
nominate several novel potential pharmacotherapies for the
treatment of AD+ P, and provide initial experimental validation
that administration of one of the nominated drugs, maraviroc, to
adult mice yielded a net reversal of the PSD protein signature of
AD + P. Future studies are required to evaluate the ability of
maraviroc and the other identiﬁed drugs to reverse the AD+ P
PSD proteome signature in animal models of AD-related
pathologies and to delineate the phosphoproteome signature of
the AD+ P PSD.
Methods
Subjects. Tissue from subjects with AD were obtained from the brain bank of the
Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) at the University of Pittsburgh, using
protocols approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board and
Committee for Oversight of Research and Clinical Training Involving Decedents.
An initial group of 110 cases with a primary neuropathologic diagnosis of Alz-
heimer’s disease, a Braak stage between 3 and 5 were selected. End-stage cases, as
deﬁned by a Braak stage of 6, were excluded. Three AD cases were subsequently
removed from analysis after QC of the proteomics data. A fourth case was dis-
covered, prior to statistical analyses, to have not met inclusion criteria (did not
meet neuropathologic criteria for AD) and was excluded, leaving a total of 106 AD
subjects (Table 2).
Subjects underwent comprehensive evaluations by experienced clinicians in the
ADRC, including neurologic, neuropsychological, and psychiatric
assessments
16,17,35. Using this information, information obtained from clinical
records, and structured interviews with surviving relatives, an independent
committee of experienced clinicians made consensus DSM-IV diagnoses for each
subject. Psychosis was deﬁned as the presence of delusions or hallucinations at any
Fig. 3 Maraviroc effects on the PSD proteome signature of AD+ P. Adult
C57Bl/6 J WT mice were randomized to daily intraperitoneal injection of
maraviroc 50 mg/kg or vehicle for 5 days. 1370 of the 1613 proteins that
comprised our PSD signature of AD+ P, including 201 of the 240 PSD
proteins that were nominally signiﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P, were
successfully quantiﬁed. a Maraviroc treatment had a net effect of increasing
the abundance of 1370 proteins. The corresponding fold changes in AD+ P
vs AD-P for the identical proteins are also shown.b Maraviroc treatment
similarly had a net effect of increasing abundance in the subset of 201
proteins. P values are from one sample t-tests where the null was a
Log2(fold-change)=0.

excluded from the study.
Fixed and frozen tissue samples from 19 elderly cognitively normal comparison
subjects from the Religious Order Study (ROS) were obtained from the Rush
Alzheimer’s Disease Center (Table2), along with basic demographic and
neuropathologic information
36. Mild neurodegenerative pathologic changes were
accepted, up to a Braak stage of 2 for tau pathology, presence of sparse neuritic
plaques or early TDP-43 pathology.
All subject samples were identiﬁed by a code number, and staff were blind to
diagnosis group at all stages of sample preparation, data generation, and data
extraction.
Sample collection and neuropathologic assessment. For ADRC subjects, post-
mortem interval (PMI) was recorded at the time of brain removal. At autopsy, the
brain was removed intact, examined grossly, and divided in the midsagittal plane.
Gray matter samples from the right superior frontal gyrus of the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were dissected and frozen at−80 °C. The left hemibrain
was immersionﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin for at least one week, sectioned into
1.0 cm coronal slabs, and sampled according to Consortium to Establish a Registry
for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) protocol for neuropathological diagnosis of
AD
37 or, since 2012, following National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer’s Association
(NIA-AA) guidelines38. AD pathology was evaluated using the modiﬁed Biel-
schowsky silver stain39 and immunohistochemical staining for tau and amyloidβ.
Neuritic plaque density was assessed according to CERAD criteria37; distribution of
tau pathology was classiﬁed according to Braak stages40. Lewy body pathology was
assessed by alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry, and positive cases were clas-
siﬁed into amygdala-predominant, limbic/neocortical-predominant, or other
categories, a modiﬁed scheme based on consensus criteria38,41. For analysis in this
study, all alpha-synuclein positive categories were combined into one Lewy body
positive group. Immunohistochemical staining for phospho-TDP-43 was per-
formed on sections of amygdala, hippocampus, mesial temporal cortex and middle
frontal gyrus
42. Sections were evaluated for the absence or presence of TDP-43
positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, neuronal intranuclear inclusions and
dystrophic neurites. Based on the distribution of TDP-43 pathology, positive cases
were classiﬁed into amygdala-predominant, mesial temporal, neocortical, or in
cases when amygdala sections were not available, but all other sections were TDP-
43 negative, indeterminate categories. For analysis in this study, all TDP-43
positive categories were combined into one TDP-43 positive group.
Assessment of vascular pathology included atherosclerosis of the circle of Willis,
arteriolosclerosis in frontal white matter and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in
DLPFC. Each was rated as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3), and a
sum score was generated by adding the three individual scores. Microvascular
lesions (MVL) were deﬁned as remote microinfarcts/microhemorrhages not seen
on gross examination and less than 1.0 cm in size. MVLs were enumerated in
standardized sections
38 of middle frontal gyrus (DLPFC), superior and middle
temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, occipital cortex (BA 17/18), basal ganglia at
level of anterior commissure, and thalamus at the level of the subthalamic nucleus
to create MVL counts.
Neuropathologic diagnoses of Alzheimer disease were made according to
CERAD criteria
37, although all AD subjects also met NIA-Reagan criteria43 for
intermediate to high probability that their dementia was due to AD lesions.
For the 19 elderly cognitively normal comparison subjects from the ROS, the
same variables were provided to us, including Braak stage, CERAD neuritic plaque
scores, presence/absence of TDP-43 and Lewy body pathologies, severity of
vascular pathologies, and diagnostic classiﬁcation based on modiﬁed CERAD and
NIA-Reagan criteria (applying criteria in the absence of a diagnosis of dementia)44.
Biochemical fractionation and LC-MS/MS. Prior to biochemical fractionation,
subjects were stratiﬁed into blocks of 10-11 subjects. Each block was balanced for
diagnosis and sex. A post-hoc check ensured that the distributions of PMI, age, age
of AD onset, Braak stage and APOE*ε4 carrier status did not differ between blocks.
The order in which subject blocks were processed was randomized between suc-
cessive stages of processing described below (i.e. between measurement of protein
concentration, trypsin digestion, labeling with TMTPro, fractionation, and MS
injection. PSD enrichments were generated using a variation on our previously
described approach
45. Grey matter was homogenized in Syn-PER reagent (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA); synaptosomes were prepared according to manu-
facturer’s protocol and washed with 1 ml 0.1 mM CaCl2. The washed pellet was
resuspended in 500 µl of 20 mm Tris pH 8.0 with 1% Triton X-100, agitated on a
rocker at 4 °C for 30 minutes, and centrifuged at 47,000 RPM for 30 min at 4 °C in
the outer rim of a Sorval S80-AT2. The resulting pellet was washed with 250 µl
0.1 mM CaCl
2 and centrifuged at 47,000 RPM for 30 min at 4 °C. The washed PSD
pellet was taken up in 50 µl 1X S-Trap Buffer (100 mM TEAB, 5% SDS), vortexed,
and bath sonicated. Total protein concentration was determined by Micro-BCA
(Thermo Scientiﬁc).
A total of 10 µg total PSD protein from each sample were reduced, alkylated,
and trypsin digested on S-Trap™ micro spin columns (ProtiFi) per manufacturer’s
protocol. Subject blocks were randomly assigned to TMT blocks and labeled with
TMTPro channels 1–11 as described in ref.
46. A pooled control was created using
aliquots from the homogenate and synaptosome preparation steps which precede
PSD generation (to save tissue resources). The pooled control was digested
separately with S-Trap™ mini spin columns (ProtiFi, Farmingdale NY), split in two,
and labeled with TMTPro channels 12 and 13. TMT labeled subject preparations
from the same block were pooled along with 10 µg of the labeled pooled controls.
The TMT labeled peptide pools were separated into eight fractions with the Pierce™
High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc) per
manufacture’s protocol, evaporated, and reconstituted in 20 µl 97% H2O, 3% ACN,
0.1% formic acid.
Approximately 1 µg of TMT labeled peptides was loaded onto a heated PepMap
RSLC C18 2 µm, 100 angstrom, 75 µm × 50 cm column (ThermoScientiﬁc) and
eluted over 180 min gradients optimized for each high pH reverse-phase fraction as
in
47. Sample eluate was electrosprayed (2000 V) into a Thermo Scientiﬁc Orbitrap
Eclipse mass spectrometer for analysis. MS1 spectra were acquired at a resolving
power of 120,000. MS2 spectra were acquired in the Ion Trap with CID (35%) in
centroid mode. Real-time search (max search time= 34 s; max missed
cleavages = 1; Xcorr= 1; dCn= 0.1; ppm= 5) was used for MS3. MS3 spectra

Raw MS ﬁles were processed in Proteome Discoverer version 2.5
(ThermoScientiﬁc). MS spectra were searched against theHomo sapiensSwissProt
database. SEQUEST search engine was used (enzyme=trypsin, max. missed
cleavage=2, min. peptide length=6, precursor tolerance=10ppm). Static
modiﬁcations include acetylation (N-term,+42.011 Da), Met-loss (N-term,
-131.040 Da), Met-loss+Acetyl (N-temr,−89.030 Da), and TMT labeling (N-term
and K,+229.163 Da). Dynamic modiﬁcation included oxidation (M,+15.995 Da).
Peptide spectral matches wereﬁltered by the Percolator node (max Delta Cn=0.05,
target FDR (strict)=0.01, and target FDR (relaxed)=0.05). Reporter ion
quantiﬁcation was based on corrected S/N values with the following settings:
integration tolerance=20ppm, method=most conﬁdent centroid, co-isolation
threshold=100, and SPS mass matches=65.
Quantitative immunohistochemistry. Serial 5μm thick formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-
embedded tissue sections were immunostained on an automated stainer (Discovery
Ultra, Ventana, Tucson, AZ) using the following primary antibodies: PHF-1
(1:1000, kindly provided by Peter Davies), beta-amyloid NAB228 (1:4000 (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), after 40 min pretreatment with 90% formic
acid), and microglial markers Iba1 (1:500, Wako, Richmond, VA) and HLA-DR
(1:100, Dako, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Except for beta-amyloid,
slides for all other stains were pretreated with Discovery CC1 solution, a Tris-based
buffer with a slightly basic pH (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). All slides
were developed using a multimeric HRP/DAB detection system (Ventana Medical
Systems, Tucson, AZ). No counterstaining was performed to ease signal
quantiﬁcation.
Microscopy. Whole slide digital images of the immunostained sections were cre-
ated using a Mirax MIDI slide scanner (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) or Aperio AT2 slide
scanner (Leica, Deer Park, IL) at 40x resolution. A subset of cases was scanned on
both scanners to conﬁrm very high concordance of digital image analysis results.
Digital image analysis was performed using NearCyte software (Andrew Lesniak,
University of Pittsburgh). For each section, 4 rectangular regions of interest (ROI)
of 4mm
2 were created. These ROIs were deﬁned to span the entire cortical
thickness and were preferentially placed midway along the gyral axis to avoid
tangentially cut cortical regions. Minor manual adjustments were made to adapt to
curvatures and irregularities in the cortical ribbon. Once placed for theﬁrst ana-
lyzed stain (PHF-1), the same ROIs were re-used for all subsequent stains. If tissue
folds or other artifacts prevented placement in the same location, the ROI was
moved to an acceptable site as close as possible to the original location. For
quantitative image analysis, thresholds for signal positivity were optimized
manually for each stain and then maintained constant throughout the analysis of
all slides. Signals from all four ROIs were integrated into two outcome variables:
area ratio (= positive area/entire ﬁeld area) and mean signal intensity. For HLA-
DR and Iba1 stains, an additional variable, the HLA-DR/Iba1 ratio was derived to
normalize microglial activation (HLA-DR) to microglial density (Iba1). All ana-
lyses were done blinded to psychosis status.
LC-MS/MS quality control and normalization. Zero abundance was treated as
missing and missing rate was compared across samples. No obvious difference was
found across plexes or diagnosis groups (Fig. S6). Then we performed rigorous QC
and normalization on all quantiﬁed peptides. First, we performed sample loading
normalization to make the total abundance the same across all samples. Second,
peptides that were missing in both pooled control samples in at least half of the
plexes were removed. We also removed peptides that were mapped to multiple
proteins or genes. Three AD subjects who were included in the assay were deemed
as outliers based on their total abundances (Fig. S7a, b) and they were excluded
from the subsequent data normalization steps and analyses. Next, an internal
reference scaling (IRS) normalization
48 was performed for each peptide, where the
scaling factor (for each plex) was calculated as the ratio of the overall mean of all
pooled samples to the mean of the within-plex pooled samples. Finally, a median
normalization was performed to make the median of each sample equal to the
overall median of all samples (Fig. S7c). Post QC we quantiﬁed 27,919 peptides
with a missing rate≤50% across all samples and 5,807 peptides for which all
peptides were quantiﬁed in all samples (i.e. missing rate= 0%).
One additional subject who was included in the above normalizations was
discovered, prior to statistical analysis, to have not met inclusion criteria (did not
meet neuropath criteria for AD) and was excluded from all subsequent analyses,
leaving a ﬁnal cohort for analysis of 106 AD subjects and a reference group of 19
normal comparison subjects (Table2).
Statistical analysis. Sample size was determined by power analysis of data from
our prior publication
16. Power was a function of sample size and pi, where pi is the
proportion of altered protein ratios between AD-P and AD+ P. Assumptions for
the power analysis were that the average ratio for the pi proteins would be= 1.17
(and for the 1-pi proteins would= 1.0), SD (on log2 protein level)= 1.0, and one-
sided alpha= 0.05. Based on these criteria, we projected a sample size between 90
and 120 AD subjects would yield power of 0.75–0.84.
To test PSD yield between groups we performed linear regression. To test
protein abundance, for each sample we multiplied the PSD yield to the normalized
peptide abundance to account for the PSD yield variation in samples. Next, we
performed PeCorA49 analysis to identify“uncorrelated” peptides within each
protein. In the end, we rolled up yield-adjusted peptide data to protein level by
averaging the z-score of each peptide (on the log2 scale) that is mapped to the same
protein. The“uncorrelated” peptides were treated as separate proteins and were not
rolled up. Using a present call threshold of 100% when selecting peptides in the
roll-up step resulted in 1613 proteins for analysis, and a threshold of 50% yielded
4025 proteins. These values compare favorably with recent studies reporting
6,533–8,619 proteins with a missing rate≤50% assayed using similar methods
(albeit with a deeper off-line fractionation) in the more complex total gray matter
proteome in AD
19,50. Then linear regression was performed using the Limma
package51,52 in R (version 4.1.0) for each yield-adjusted protein.
For tests of our primary comparison between AD+ P and AD-P, all analyses
adjusted for age, PMI, sex, APOE*ε4 carrier status, Lewy body positivity, and
phospho-tau area ratio (log2 transformed). For comparisons of the AD groups to
our reference group of cognitively normal elderly subjects, analyses were adjusted
for age, PMI, and sex. APOE*ε4 carrier status and neuropathology variables were
excluded from these comparisons as they are highly associated with diagnosis
comparing AD and control. In all analyses two-group model-based log2 of fold
change between any two groups was calculated for each protein. All statistical tests
performed are two-sided. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to yield
FDR-adjusted p-values.
Functional annotation clustering analysis of differentially expressed proteins
was performed with DAVID53, using the default settings. In each analysis the
nominally signiﬁcantly differentially expressed proteins were tested for enrichment
relative to a background of the 1613 proteins quantiﬁed in all samples (or in
supplemental analyses a background of the 4025 proteins with missing rate <50%).
Computational systems pharmacology. Since all of the nominally signiﬁcant
differentially expressed proteins were reduced in AD+ P relative to AD-P, medi-
cations that directly target these proteins may have reduced efﬁcacy due to the
lower levels of the target. Therefore, we utilized a strategy designed to identify
upstream targets that regulate the expression of these nominally differentially
expressed proteins.
The Illumina correlation engine (https://hsls.ce.basespace.illumina.com/c/nextbio.nb)
knockdown atlas was used to identify genes which, when knocked down, altered
expression of the mRNA corresponding to the 1613 proteins quantiﬁed in 100% of AD
subjects. The identiﬁed genes (upstream-genes) were then extracted, as were the
correlations of their knockdown transcriptome signature with the directions of alteration
of the 1613 proteins.
To identify medications that target the upstream-genes, information about
medications and their targets were extracted from DrugBank (https://www.
drugbank.ca/)
54 including medication names, targets of medications and their
corresponding actions. The desired drug-target action was identiﬁed by aligning
the correlation between upstream-gene knockdown and our dataset. For example,
if an upstream-gene was negatively correlated with our dataset, it means that its
knockout recapitulated many of the alterations we observed in AD+ P relative to
AD-P. Therefore, drugs that antagonize or otherwise inhibit its activity would be
predicted to induce a signal that can reverse the expression proﬁle we observed in
AD + P, which may lead to beneﬁcial effects.
To conﬁrm whether our identiﬁed drug candidates themselves would result in
reversing the AD+ P PSD proteome signature, we extracted the gene expression
proﬁle for each drug from Level 5 LINCS L1000 data
55, a collection of gene
expression proﬁles for thousands of perturbagens at a variety of time points, doses,
and cell lines (GEO database accession numbers: GSE70138 and GSE92742). The
gene expression proﬁles were included only if they were from drug treatments on a
cell line derived from the central nervous system and the drug dose was≥ 1 µM. To
identify genes that were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed, the Z scores from
multiple tests for a same gene were averaged. An average |Z | > 1 was considered a
signiﬁcant effect
56.
The association between drug and PSD data was quantitatively evaluated with
the Signed Jaccard Index20. The index ranges from+1t o −1, where +1 and −1
indicate the same, or inverse, pattern of two gene sets.
Maraviroc effects on the PSD proteome. Maraviroc was dissolved in a vehicle
solution of 18% ethanol in normal saline. Twelve 3mo old C57Bl/6 J WT mice (6
males and 6 females) were randomized to daily intraperitoneal injection of mar-
aviroc 50 mg/kg or an equivalent volume of vehicle, balanced for sex and with the
experimenter blind to injectate identity. Mice were sacriﬁced 2 hours post the last
daily injection, to approximate Tmax, and the right cerebral cortex was harvested
on dry ice for proteomics. Biochemical Fractionation and LC-MS/MS were as
described above. Sample QC was as described above. One maraviroc-treated mouse
was identiﬁed as having protein yield (0.35 µg/µl) much lower than the mean yield
of the remaining mice (1.31 µg/µl). It was conﬁrmed to be an outlier when
examining the resultant peptide abundances as part of the sample QC (Fig. S8) and
was excluded from analyses, leaving aﬁnal N of 5 maraviroc treated and 6 vehicle
treated mice. Post QC a total of 22,965 peptides with 100% present calls were

COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY|           (2023) 6:598 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-04961-5 | www.nature.com/commsbio 9 ","The study identified differential protein expression patterns associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by analyzing brain tissue samples from individuals with AD and cognitively normal elderly controls. Key findings include altered abundances of RNA-binding proteins, splicing factors, and ribosomal proteins in AD brains compared to controls. The research also uncovered potential drug targets for AD through computational pharmacology analyses using the L1000 platform. Proteomic data were obtained from human postmortem brain tissues via targeted and microdomain-specific quantification methods. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of RNA processing, splicing, and ribosomal function pathways in AD brains. The study highlights the importance of RNA regulation in AD pathogenesis and suggests therapeutic targets for this neurodegenerative disease.","Individuals with Alzheimer Disease who develop psychotic symptoms (AD+ P) experience more rapid cognitive decline and have reduced indices of synaptic integrity relative to those without psychosis (AD-P). We sought to determine whether the postsynaptic density (PSD) proteome is altered in AD+ P relative to AD-P, analyzing PSDs from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of AD+ P, AD-P, and a reference group of cognitively normal elderly subjects. The PSD proteome of AD+ P showed a global shift towards lower levels of all proteins relative to AD-P, enriched for kinases, proteins regulating Rho GTPases, and other regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. We computationally identiﬁed potential novel therapies predicted to reverse the PSD protein signature of AD+ P. Five days of administration of one of these drugs, the C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 inhibitor, maraviroc, led to a net reversal of the PSD protein signature in adult mice, nominating it as a novel potential treatment for AD+ P.","Psychotic symptoms affect ~40 –60% of individuals with Alzheimer Disease (AD) 1. AD subjects with psychosis (AD + P) experience greater cognitive dysfunction early in disease progression prior to psychosis onset2,3 and more rapid cognitive decline compared to AD subjects without psychosis (AD-P)1–4. Current treatments for psychosis in AD with anti-psychotics have limited efﬁcacy, do not mitigate the more rapid cognitive decline, and confer excess mortality 5. In addition, AD + P is associated with worse outcomes than AD-P, including higher rates of aggression 6, caregiver distress 7, functional decline8, institutionalization9, and mortality 10. Thus, there is strong motivation to identify the biology underlying psychosis in AD in hopes of developing a targeted, more ef ﬁcacious intervention. The risk for psychosis in AD is to a large extent genetically determined, with an estimated heritability of 60%, indicative of a distinct biologic vulnerability4,11,12. Because it has long been recognized that synapse loss is the strongest neuropathologic correlate of cognitive decline in AD13,14, it has been hypothesized that the vulnerability to AD + P arises from greater synaptic impairment in AD+ P than AD-P. Prior studies that compared AD + P to AD-P subjects on a number of correlates of synapse integrity, including gray matter volumes, cerebral glucose utili-zation or blood ﬂow, or gray matter concentrations of the membrane breakdown products, glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine, have found support for this hypothesis across neocortical, but not medial temporal regions (reviewed in ref. 15). Most recently, we examined gray matter levels of a limited panel of 190 synaptic proteins in individuals with AD + P and found reductions in canonical postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins relative to AD-P subjects 16. These dif-ferences exceeded those which could be accounted for by any dif ferences in neuropathology burden between the groups16,o rb y reductions in the corresponding mRNA transcripts due to greater excitatory neuron loss in AD+ P17. None of these prior studies have directly examined the PSD in AD + P. We therefore conducted a proteomic analysis of PSD fractions from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of a large group of individuals with AD+ P and AD- P. To facilitate interpretation of differences between AD + P and AD-P we also included a reference group of cognitively normal elderly subjects. We found a global shift to reduced levels of PSD proteins in AD+ P subjects relative to both AD-P and cognitively normal subjects. There was a global shift towards lower levels in PSDs from AD+ P relative to AD-P subjects, including lower levels of a network of kinases, proteins regulating Rho GTPases, and proteins regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Using computational systems pharmacology we identi ﬁed several currently approved drugs predicted to reverse the PSD protein level differences between AD+ P and AD-P. Five days of exposure to one of these drugs, maraviroc, led to a net reversal of the PSD protein signature in adult mice, nominating it as a novel potential treatment for AD+ P.","PSD abundance in AD with and without psychosis. Prior to evaluating the full cohort, we validated our PSD enrichment in a subset of the AD cases (Fig. S1). To explore whether psychosis status globally affected the PSD yield in AD, weﬁrst evaluated the association of AD+ P with total gray matter yield of PSD protein (Fig. S2). Mean µg PSD/µg of gray matter protein was sig-niﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P relative to both AD-P and elderly cognitively normal subjects. The reduction in PSD yield in AD-P relative to elderly cognitively normal subjects was not signiﬁcant. PSD protein levels in AD with and without psychosis.W en e x t evaluated yield-adjusted PSD protein levels, conservatively limiting our initial analysis to the peptides present in 100% of subjects, comprising 1,613 proteins (Fig.1). There was a signiﬁcant shift in abundance of almost all proteins to lower levels in AD+ Pc o m -pared to AD-P (t=−90.6, df=1612, p <2×1 0−307). We con-ducted additional analyses to conﬁrm the robustness of this global shift. The global reduction was similarly present in the larger set of PSD proteins quantiﬁed using peptides present in≥50% of samples (Fig. S3a). Similarly, the global reduction of PSD protein levels persisted when covarying for excitatory neuron proportion, a measure we previously reported is reduced in AD+ P relative to AD-P17 (Fig. S3b, c). No individual protein level was signiﬁcantly reduced with an adjusted p < 0.05 (Supplementary Data 1). Thus, to characterize the nature of the broader signal of global reduction, we examined the 240 most reduced proteins (those with unadjustedp < 0.05). Functional annotation analysis of these 240 PSD proteins relative to a background of the 1,613 proteins that were quantiﬁed in 100% of subjects revealed strong enrichment for regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical determinant of post-synaptic dendritic spine structure and function (Supplementary Data 2). These included actin binding proteins and regulators of Rho GTPase signaling such as Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain containing Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) and Rho GTPase activating proteins (RhoGAPs). Additionally, there was enrichment for 23 protein serine/threonine kinases (Supplementary Data 2). These 23 kinases, which are important regulators of RhoGEFs, RhoGAPs, and actin binding proteins18, interact within a network that was itself enriched for the remaining 217 PSD proteins with nominally signiﬁcant reduc-tions in AD + P (Fig. 2). In addition to kinases, PH domain containing proteins, and actin binding proteins, the network included PDZ domain containing proteins and microtubule binding proteins, suggestive of disrupted signaling to additional post-synaptic structural elements (Fig. 2b). Choice of a more liberal threshold for peptide inclusion (e.g., present call≥50%) did not substantially alter the functional annotation ﬁndings, although now enrichment for histone proteins also emerged (Supplementary Data 3). Comparison of AD + P and AD-P with elderly cognitively normal subjects. While our focus was on the comparison of AD + P relative to AD-P, our dataset provided an opportunity to examine how the PSD is altered in these groups relative to our reference group of elderly cognitively normal subjects. Both AD groups were characterized by a signiﬁcant shift towards lower PSD protein levels compared to cognitively normal reference group, with greater reductions in AD + P than in AD-P (Figure S4a–c). As a result, 836/1613 (51.8%) proteins had an adjusted p < 0.05 in AD+ P in comparison to the reference group, whereas the corresponding number was 2/1613 (0.001%) proteins for the AD-P group (Supplementary Data 4). The pro-tein whose abundance was most altered between the AD and comparison subjects was APP, due solely to the increased levels of two peptides found within the Aβ sequence (RHDSGYEVHHQK and KLVFFAEDVGSNK, Supplementary Data 4 and noted as Aβ in Fig. S4c). Overall, the protein alterations present in the two AD groups relative to elderly cognitively normal subjects were highly correlated (Fig. S4c). As a consequence, both groups showed enrichment of differentially expressed proteins involved in pro-tein translation and of glycoproteins. Nevertheless, functional annotation of the proteins that differentiated AD+ P or AD-P from reference subjects revealed some differential patterns of enrichment. PSD proteins that differentiated AD+ P from elderly cognitively normal subjects included enrichment for proteins involved in calcium signaling, synaptic function, and cytoskeletal proteins. PSD proteins that differentiated AD-P from elderly cognitively normal subjects were enriched for proteins involved in protein quality control, ion channels, and small GTPases (Sup-plementary Data 5). We also undertook to contrast the PSD signature of AD±P relative to elderly cognitively normal subjects to the most extensive prior examination of the functional enrichment of proteins in total gray matter homogenates of individuals with AD and elderly controls subjects, reported in19. This contrast is summarized in Fig. S5. The differentially expressed proteins in the PSDs of both AD +P and AD-P shared with the overall gray matter homogenate enrichment for ribosomal proteins and glycoproteins. Other gray matter functional enrichments shared with either AD +P (Synapse, Mitochondria) or AD-P (Cell-ECM interactions, Ubi-quitination) may indicate that some of the overall signal detected in AD homogenate derives primarily from subgroups of individuals with or without psychosis. Finally, enrichments detected only in the PSD preparations (e.g. impacting Calcium signaling, ion transport, and the cytoskeleton) may reﬂect pathologic cascades that are most prominent within PSDs and not as readily detected in the multicellular, multicompartmental, gray matter homogenate. As such, these functions may represent postsynaptic-speciﬁc targets for intervention for cognitive impairment more generally. Relationship to genetic risk for AD with psychosis. We recently reported genome-wide gene-based tests of association with psy-chosis in AD11. A total of 239 of the 240 PSD proteins that were nominally signiﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P had available corre-sponding gene-based tests of association (Supplementary Data 6, and Supplemental Materials). Of these 239 genes whose proteins were assayed, 11 genes which were nominally altered at the protein level in AD+ P also exhibited at least nominal evidence of genetic association with AD+ P relative to AD-P. Notable among these were the actin binding protein genes SYNPO, SYNE1, ALDOA, and VPS16. Also included were the kinase PRKCI, and the GAPTBC1D10B. Predicted drug activity against the AD+ P PSD protein net-work. We next sought to identify existing pharmacotherapies with potential abilities to target the disrupted PSD signature of AD + P. We identiﬁed 50 gene knockout datasets in which the resulting changes to the transcriptome were correlated with the PSD protein signature of AD+ P (Supplementary Data 7). We identiﬁed 46 drugs targeting these genes, 7 of which showed the desired effect (inhibitor/antagonist or positive regulator) on the targeted gene (Table1). To further assess, computationally, the potential post-treatment effect of the nominated drugs on PSD protein levels in AD + P, two additional analyses were performed. First, the expression signatures due to knockdown of the upstream-genes were correlated with only the 240 PSD pro-teins nominally signiﬁcantly reduced in AD+ P to ensure that the correlation between the knockdown signature and AD+ P persisted when examining the most dysregulated proteins. This analysis identiﬁed thatMTOR had a correlation with the top 240 proteins that were opposite (negative) to its overall correlation with the 1613 proteins, excluding it, and its positive regulator, pimecrolimus, from further consideration. Second, we undertook to validate the gene signatures of the remaining candidate drugs. Of these, leronlimab, ibalizumab, and epigallocatechin gallate were not found in the LINCS database for evaluation of their induced transcriptome expression signatures, and procaine was not tested in CNS cells. Two of the remaining three medications, fostamatinib and maraviroc demonstrated transcriptome expression signatures that were negatively corre-lated with the AD+ P PSD protein signature (Signed Jaccard Indexes of −0.0025 and −0.0009, respectively, Supplementary Data 8). Effect of maraviroc on the PSD proteome. We looked to con-ﬁrm our prediction for one of the above drugs, maraviroc, by testing its effects on the PSD proteome in mice. We administered either 50 mg/kg maraviroc dissolved in a vehicle solution of 18% ethanol in normal saline or an equivalent volume of vehicle solution alone to three-month-old C57Bl/6 J WT mice for 5 days. We successfully quantiﬁed 1370 of the 1613 proteins that com-prised our PSD signature of AD+ P, including 201 of the 240 PSD proteins that were nominally signi ﬁcantly reduced in AD + P. Maraviroc treatment had a net effect of increasing PSD protein abundance, with a more marked effect in the subset of 201 proteins most disrupted in AD+ P (Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 9). The Signed Jaccard Index was−0.01186 for maraviroc’s effect on the AD+ P PSD proteome signature. Discussion We hypothesized that AD+ P arises from a more severe synap-topathy than that which is present in AD-P, based on multiple studies that have compared indirect measures of synapse integrity both in vivo and in postmortem tissue, between AD+ P and AD-P groups 15. In the current report we provide a direct comparison of the PSD proteomes between AD + P and AD-P subjects, ﬁnding a shift to reduced levels of multiple proteins in the PSD of AD + P. Relative to AD-P, PSDs from AD+ P subjects had lower levels of protein kinases which participate in a network that is also enriched for proteins with nominally signiﬁcantly reduced levels in AD + P and for functions implicated in signaling to post-synaptic structural elements. The PSD protein reductions in AD + P relative to AD-P were not accounted for by the altered burden of neuropathologies or the greater reduction in excitatory neurons that we have previously reported in AD+ P relative to AD-P. We were then able computationally identify several novel drug treatments predicted to reverse the PSD proteome signature of AD + P, and conﬁrm that at least one of them, maraviroc, could reverse this signature in mouse cortex after short-term systemic administration. Given the prominent role post-synaptic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton plays in the maintenance and plasticity of dendritic spines18, it is not surprising that the PSD proteome of AD+ P was selectively depleted of proteins enriched for functions asso-ciated with actin regulation. The identiﬁcation of impairments of this signaling network provides an opportunity for identifying compounds that might have speci ﬁc therapeutic bene ﬁts for individuals with AD+ P. We used a novel computational strat-egy, examining the overlap of gene knockout signatures with the AD + P PSD proteome alterations to identify upstream genes amenable to perturbation by existing compounds to potentially reverse the PSD proteome alterations in AD+ P. We were able to conﬁrm this prediction for maraviroc, which generated a net reversal of the PSD proteome reductions present in AD+ Pi na mouse model. Of note, our measure of net drug effect, the Signed Jaccard Index, showed a substantially larger effect in the PSD proteome ( −0.01186) than that which was calculated using mRNA alterations induced by maraviroc in cultured neurons (−0.0009). The Signed Jaccard Index for the PSD proteome effect was similar to to the mean Signed Jaccard Index of−0.03264 that we reported for drugs indicated for treatment of CNS disease 20. While our computational prediction was conﬁrmed for mar-aviroc, several caveats persist. Our validation was conducted in adult wildtype mice. Further tests in mouse models expressing AD-associated pathologies are warranted. Although there is no deﬁnitive mouse model for psychosis in AD21, the PSD proteome signature of at least some models of Aβ overproduction overlap with that of AD+ P16. Even if maraviroc’s effects are further conﬁrmed in AD models, a number of limitations may arise when repurposing a drug developed for treating other conditions. For example, any medication used will be applied to frail elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities, so preferred agents would be documented to be well-tolerated in such a population. Maraviroc, which was developed for chronic treatment of HIV infection, may well meet this tolerability benchmark, as might one of the other medications we identiﬁed, fostamatinib, which was developed for chronic use in populations with serious auto-immune disease22,23. Finally, we note that our conﬁrmation for maraviroc need not hold true for the other identiﬁed compounds, which will require independent validation in intact neural model systems to evaluate their effects on the PSD. Nevertheless, our strategy identiﬁed several genes that could represent novel targets for addressing the synaptic impairments in AD+ P. For example, actin rod formation in neurons, which is promoted by agonism of the C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5), the target of maraviroc, has been increasingly recognized as a component of Alzheimer’s neuropathology that induces PSD loss24,25. Likewise, treatment with maraviroc improved cognition in a small study of individuals with HIV-associated neurocogni-tive disorder 26. Aurora Kinase B (AURKB), the target by which fostamatinib was identiﬁed as a drug of potential beneﬁt for AD + P, has recently been shown to play a role in promoting neurite formation during early neuronal development27 and to promote axonal repair after injury in post-mitotic neurons28. Additionally, we identiﬁed reductions in levels of group of protein kinases that interact with a network that also includes other altered PSD proteins which serve to regulate the cytoske-leton. The roles of many of these kinases in the synaptic plasticity processes that regulate the maintenance of dendritic spines is well established (e.g. CAMK2A29, LIMK130, typical31 and atypical32 PRKCs, TRIO33). Of interest, one of the atypical PRKCs, PRKCI, while not itself established as having a role in spine maintenance, was among the genes identiﬁed as nominally signiﬁcantly asso-ciated with AD+ P (Supplementary Data 6). We also identiﬁed TBK1, a kinase that when disrupted causes frontotemporal dementia/ALS and induces dendritic spine loss in animal models34. Albeit, whether TBK1 has a normative role in spine maintenance is not established. It is likely that not just PSD protein levels of these kinases, but their phosphorylation-dependent activation, and the extent of phosphorylation of their downstream targets, are altered in the PSD of AD + P relative to AD-P. Thus, an important future direction will be to delineate the phosphoproteome signature of the AD+ P PSD. Such an investigation may both help to nominate candidate therapies directly targeting the altered kinases and may provide another metric to assess the therapeutic potential of other drug candidates. We report theﬁrst study, to our knowledge, to directly inter-rogate the PSD in AD+ P. The abundance of numerous PSD proteins was reduced in AD + P relative to both AD-P and comparison subjects. Examination of the PSD proteome signature of AD+ P, relative to AD-P, revealed lower levels of an inter-acting set of protein kinases, regulators of Rho GTPases, and other protein regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. We were able to use the PSD protein signature of AD + P to computationally nominate several novel potential pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AD+ P, and provide initial experimental validation that administration of one of the nominated drugs, maraviroc, to adult mice yielded a net reversal of the PSD protein signature of AD + P. Future studies are required to evaluate the ability of maraviroc and the other identiﬁed drugs to reverse the AD+ P PSD proteome signature in animal models of AD-related pathologies and to delineate the phosphoproteome signature of the AD+ P PSD."

The amyloid β peptide (Aβ), starting with pyroglutamate (pE) at
position 3 and ending at position 42 (Aβ3pE-42), predominantly
accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease. Consistently,
donanemab, a therapeutic antibody raised against Aβ3pE-42, has
been shown to be effective in recent clinical trials. Although the
primary Aβ produced physiologically is Aβ1-40/42, an explanation
for how and why this physiological A β is converted to the
pathological form remains elusive. Here, we present experi-
mental evidence that accounts for the aging-associated Aβ3pE-42
deposition: Aβ3pE-42 was metabolically more stable than other
Aβx-42 variants; deﬁciency of neprilysin, the major Aβ-degrading
enzyme, induced a relatively selective deposition of Aβ3pE-42 in
both APP transgenic andApp knock-in mouse brains; Aβ3pE-42
deposition always colocalized with Pittsburgh compound B–
positive cored plaques in APP transgenic mouse brains; and under
aberrant conditions, such as a signiﬁcant reduction in neprilysin
activity, aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, and glutaminyl-
peptide cyclotransferase-like were up-regulated in the progres-
sion of aging, and a proportion of Aβ1-42 may be processed to
Aβ3pE-42. Our ﬁndings suggest that anti-Aβ therapies are more
effective if given before Aβ3pE-42 deposition.

Introduction
Senile plaques, which are one of the key pathological features
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are composed of amyloidβ peptides
(Aβs) with a variety of secondary and tertiary structures because
of post-translational modiﬁcations (Saido et al, 1995, 1996). This
heterogeneity appears to affect catabolism and aggregation rates,
resulting in structural changes in plaques. It has been reported
repeatedly that most of Aβ in the brains of aged humans and in
Down syndrome starts with pyroglutamate (pE) at position 3 and
ends at position 42 (Aβ3pE-42) (Harigaya et al, 1995; Saido et al, 1995,
1996; Iwatsubo et al, 1996; Lemere et al, 1996; Kawarabayashi et al,
2001; Frost et al, 2013). In contrast, transgenic (Tg) mice over-
expressing human APP with pathogenic mutations primarily ac-
cumulate A β1-40 and Aβ 1-42 ( Sturchler-Pierrat et al, 1997 ;
Kawarabayashi et al, 2001). We reassessed this observation in the
brains of AD patients quantitatively using a panel of antibodies
capable of distinguishing among amino-terminal variants or among
carboxyl-terminal variants of Aβ and veriﬁed that the predominant
Aβ variant in the brains of AD patients is indeed Aβ3pE-42 (>40% of
total Aβ)( Fig S1). There is, however, some discrepancy among
different reports regarding the quantity of Aβ variants, which vary
depending on the methods employed. For instance, the group led
by Michel Goedert, who used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and LC-
MS/MS to resolve the cryo-EM structure of Aβ42 ﬁlaments from
human brains, recently indicated that Aβ3pE-42 was a minor variant
in the brains of AD patients andApp knock-in (KI) mice (Yang et al,
2022). This inconsistency can be accounted for by the unique
physicochemical nature of Aβ3pE-42, which is seldom recovered
from reversed-phase HPLC under normal conditions (Table S1).
However, the use of a heated (50°C) basic solvent containing be-
taine and limited proteolysis using lysyl endopeptidase allows full
recovery in HPLC and detection by mass spectrometry, respectively.
These observations explain the relatively low estimation of Aβ3pE-
42 levels in some prior studies as well (Glenner & Wong, 1984, 2012;
Wong et al, 1985; Mori et al, 1992). Consistently,Güntert et al (2006)
successfully detected A β3pE-42 in the human brain by mass
spectrometry after sufﬁcient
 proteolytic digestion. It is notable that
a therapeutic antibody raised against this variant, donanemab, has

2012; Sims et al, 2023).
The selective deposition of this physiologically rare Aβ variant in
the human brain appears to be attributed to its presumed meta-
bolic stability and aggregation propensity because pyroglutamyl
peptide is resistant to major aminopeptidases except for pyro-
glutamyl aminopeptidase (Mori et al, 1992). In accordance with this,
an immediate aminopeptidase-sensitive precursor of A β3pE-42,
Aβ3E-42, is a very minor component in AD brain (Fig S1) (Table
S2). However, our observations of in vivo A β1-42 catabolism
demonstrated that speciﬁc endoproteolysis mediated by neprilysin
(NEP), but not aminopeptidase, is the major rate-limiting step with
Aβ10-37 as a catabolic intermediate (Iwata et al, 2000). Thus, it is
unclear about the mechanisms underlying generation of Aβ3pE-42.
In addition, the presence of Aβ variants with different amino-
terminal structures in the AD brains may be explained by the as-
sumption that they have different life spans.
The present study aims to examine whether the amino-terminal
structure of Aβx-42 inﬂuences its catabolic rate in vivo based on the
diversity of its amino-terminal structure observed in the AD brain
(Fig S1). The study also serves as an initial attempt to address the
question “What determines the life spans of extracellular peptides,
such as Aβs, in the brain?” For this purpose, we synthesized amino-
terminal variants of Aβ internally radiolabeled with
3H at residues 2,
4, 9, and 17 and with14C at 20, 29, 34, 40, and 42 (Fig S2) and analyzed
their catabolic rates in the rat hippocampal tissue according to a
previously reported method (Iwata et al, 2000). Furthermore, to
elucidate possible pathways of Aβ3pE-40/42 generation, we ana-
lyzed amyloid pathologies in the brains of APP-Tg (Sturchler-Pierrat
et al, 1997) and App KI mice (Saito et al, 2014) using various ex-
perimental paradigms, such as quantitative Western blot (WB)
analysis, ELISA, mass spectrometry, and image analysis for im-
munohistochemistry and positron emission tomography (PET) of
amyloid. We found that a deﬁciency of NEP, the major Aβ-degrading
enzyme, up-regulated the compensatory pathway, where amino-
peptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, and glutaminyl-peptide
cyclotransferase-like (QPCTL) are involved, resulting in the for-
mation and relatively selective accumulation of Aβ3pE-42 in the
brains of both APP-Tg andApp KI mice.
Results
Catabolism of Aβx-42 variants in vivo
The synthesized variants included Aβ1D(L-Asp)-42, Aβ1rD(D-Asp)-
42, Aβ1AcD(acetyl-Asp)-42, Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, Aβ3pE-42, Aβ4F-42,
and Aβ17L-42 (Fig S2). The results demonstrate that subtle differ-
ences in the amino-terminal structure have a profound inﬂuence
on the way Aβis catabolized (Figs 1A–F and S3, Table 1). First, Aβ3pE-
42 was much more resistant to in vivo catabolism than Aβ1-42; most
of it remained uncatabolized even 60 min after administration into
the hippocampus, whereas Aβ1-42 was almost fully degraded within
30 min. This observation is consistent with the presumption at-
tributing the selective deposition of Aβ3pE-42 in the human brain to
its metabolic stability (Saido et al, 1995). In contrast, Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-
42, and Aβ4F-42 were catabolized even more rapidly than Aβ1-42.
These results clearly indicate the presence of structural determi-
nants of life span in the amino-terminal sequence of Aβ. Again,
these truncated Aβ peptides without pyroglutamate are consis-
tently seen as minor components deposited in the senile human
brain (Fig S1)(Saido et al, 1996). The catabolic stability of these Aβ
variants therefore correlates well with their tendencies to be
pathologically deposited in the human brain. The Aβ17L-42 (p3
fragment) appeared to have a longer in vivo half-life than Aβ1-42,
but the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 1).
These observations also indicate that the loss of theﬁrst two
amino acid residues, DA, is not the cause of the metabolic stability
of Aβ3pE-42. Loss of theα-amino group and R-conﬁguration of the
ﬁrst amino acid did not affect the metabolic rates, because Aβ1AcD-
42 and Aβ1rD-42
were degraded at a rate similar to that of A β1-42
(Table 1 and Fig S3). The speciﬁc structure of Aβ3pE-42 seems to
generate an anti-catabolism signal, as discussed below. The con-
sistently facilitated catabolism of Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, and Aβ4F-42
also indicates that the amino-terminal aspartic residue of Aβ1-42 is
involved in the regulation of the catabolic rate, generating an anti-
catabolism signal that is milder than that of Aβ3pE-42. Because the
rate-limiting step of Aβ1-42 degradation is catalyzed by NEP (Iwata
et al, 2000, 2001), the conversion of Aβ1-42 to Aβ3pE-42 is likely to
decelerate this process. The facilitation of catabolism by removal of
aspartate from Aβ1-42, however, may possibly be accounted for by
two distinct mechanisms: one is conversion to better substrates for
NEP, and the other is participation of alternative catabolic path-
way(s) with respect to Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, and Aβ4F-42. In any case,
NEP may contribute to catabolism, because a catabolic interme-
diate similar to Aβ10-37 detected during Aβ1-42 degradation (Iwata
et al, 2000) was observed (Fig 1, green arrowheads). A detailed
analysis of the peptide fragments generated during the in vivo
catabolism is required to clarify this notion.
Effect of Mme deﬁciency on N1D- and N3pE-positive amyloid
plaque deposition in the APP-Tg mouse brain
We subsequently examined the effect ofMme (gene nomenclature
of NEP) deﬁciency on deposition of amyloid plaques immunore-
active to various anti-Aβ antibodies including N1D and N3pE in the
brains of APP-Tg mice (Fig 2A and B). Mme deﬁciency modestly
increased N1D-positive amyloid plaques but induced a drastic
increase in N3pE-positive plaques, particularly at and after 18 mo of
age. Other immunostaining and thioﬂavin staining patterns were
almost similar to that of N1D immunostaining. Large plaques were
detected in the sections immunostained for N1D (Fig 2A) and plaque
size distribution for both N1D- and N3pE-positive amyloid plaques.
Interestingly, we found that plaque size was roughly divided into
three clusters: smaller/cored plaques (≤300 μm
2), intermediate
plaques (1,500–4,500 μm2), and larger plaques (>20,000μm2)( Figs
2C and S4). The numbers of both N1D- and N3pE-positive amyloid
plaques presented (Fig 2B) with a distinct size distribution: N3pE
immunoreactivity tended to be present in smaller/cored plaques
(≤300 μm
2) and intermediate plaques (1,500–4,500 μm2), whereas
N1D was present in larger plaques (>20,000μm2) in addition to the
clusters of smaller/cored plaques and intermediate plaques. The
relative increase in total N3pE-positive area byMme deﬁciency was

that NEP expression invariably declines with age (Iwata et al, 2002;
Wang et al, 2003;Russo et al, 2005; Hellstrom-Lindahl et al, 2008), it
is notable that even heterozygousMme deﬁciency, presenting an
~50% reduction in NEP activity (Iwata et al, 2001), thus resulted in a
relative increase in the ratio of Aβ3pE-40/42 to Aβ1-40/42 (Fig 2D).
We then analyzed the detergent-insoluble/formic acid– soluble
fractions of these mouse brains by mass spectrometry after the
digestion of the samples by lysyl endopeptidase (Figs 3A and Band
S5 and Table S3). We detected not only Aβ1-16 but also Aβ3pE-16 in
the brains ofMme−/−APP-Tg mice (Fig 3B). Interestingly, this fraction
contained trace quantities of Aβ2-16 and Aβ3-16, which are pre-
cursors of Aβ3pE-x. Next, we further analyzed amounts of A βs
present in the soluble fraction and accumulated in the insoluble
fraction of the brains of APP-Tg mice using Western blot (WB)
analysis (Figs 4A–C and S6) and ELISA (Fig 4D), which showed that
changes in amounts of Aβ immunoreactive to the anti-Aβ anti-
bodies basically showed similar patterns as that obtained using
immunohistochemistry: Mme deﬁciency prominently increased the
amounts of Aβ3pE-x from middle age, but a difference in the
amount of Aβ1-x between the two genotypes was not observed with
the progression of age. In contrast, the amount of Aβ3pE-x in both
genotypes kept increasing until 24 mo of age ( Fig 4B and C ),
resulting in an increased ratio of Aβ3pE-40/42 to Aβ1-40/42 (Fig 4D,
rightmost graph). Notably, detectable amounts of A β3pE-40/42
were present both in the soluble and in the insoluble fractions
(the order level of pmol/g), although they were considerably less
than that of Aβ 1-40/42. Colocalization of A β3pE-42 with cored

Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), which is known to selectively bind to
cored plaques (Maeda et al, 2007; Ikonomovic et al, 2008)( Fig 5).
Aβ3pE-42–positive signals corresponding to PiB-binding sites were
detected preferentially in the core of amyloid plaques, whereas Aβ1-
42–positive signals were observed in larger amyloid plaques (Fig 5A)
and the PiB binding was increased in Mme−/−APP-Tg mice in a
manner colocalizing with N3pE-positive cored plaques in a signiﬁ-
cant way (Fig 5B, left panel, andFig 5C). PET analysis also showed an
increase of in vivo binding of PiB in theMme−/−APP-Tg mice in an
age-dependent manner ( Fig 5B, right panel, and Fig 5D). Fur-
thermore, we found that Aβ3pE-40/42, but not Aβ1-40/42, colo-
calized well with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is known to be
involved in Aβ aggregation (Nilsson et al, 2004), in the cores of
amyloid plaques (Fig S7A). Intensities of ApoE-positive signals in
the amyloid plaques and levels of ApoE andα1-antichymotrypsin
in the soluble fraction were signiﬁcantly elevated by the Mme
deﬁciency in the 24-mo-old APP-Tg mice (Fig S7B and C). These
observations consistently indicated that Mme deﬁciency in-
creases the cored plaque–associated Aβ3pE-42.
Generation and analysis ofApp
NL-(ΔDA)-F and AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F knock-
in mouse lines
We next aimed to reproduce Aβ3pE-42 pathology in mouse models,
for which two knock-in mouse lines were generated:AppNL-(ΔDA)-F
and AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F (Fig 6A). This strategy was based on our previous
experimental results showing that primary neurons expressingAPP
cDNA with theﬁrst two amino acid residues of Aβ deleted (NL[ΔDA]
E) produced Aβ3E-40/42 and that those in which E had been
replaced by Q (NL[ΔDA]Q) produced Aβ3pE-40/42 (Shirotani et al,
2002). First, using theAppNL-F line ofApp KI mice we conﬁrmed the
effects of Mme deﬁciency as obtained with APP-Tg mice. Inciden-
tally, Mme deﬁciency not only accelerated the deposition of both
Aβ1-42 and Aβ3pE-42 in theAppNL-F line, but also increased the ratio
of Aβ3pE-42 to Aβ1-42 (Fig 6B). When we analyzed new lines ofApp
KI mice, we were indeed able to detect a trace amount (~1 fmol/g) of
Aβ3pE-42 only in the brains ofAppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-Fmice at 2 mo of age (Fig S8).
Despite our expectation, neither theAppNL-(ΔDA)-F nor theAppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F
lines exhibited any visible Aβpathology at all, even after aging (i.e., 18
mo or more) (Fig 6C). Notably, biochemical quantiﬁcation indicated that
the AppNL-F line deposited more Aβ3pE-42 than theAppNL-(ΔDA)-F and
AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F lines (Fig 6D), consistently indicating that Aβ3E-42 and
Aβ3Q-42 are much more short-lived than Aβ1-42 after production
in vivo.
In any case, both histochemical and biochemical analyses of
APP-Tg (Figs 2, 4,a n d5)a n dAppNL-F line of App KI mice (Figs 6B
and S9A) consistently indicat ed that deposition of A β3pE-42
takes place much later than that of A β1-42. The biochemical
quantity of Aβ3pE-42 accounts for only 0.1% of total Aβ42 in the
insoluble fraction of 24-mo-old AppNL-F mouse brains (Fig S9B
and C).
Changes in expression levels of exopeptidases and glutaminyl-
peptide cyclotransferases involved in AβN3pE generation by
Mme deﬁciency
We assumed that a potential pathway where aminopeptidases and
dipeptidyl peptidases may be involved (Fig S10) could compensate
for physiological Aβ degradation decreased byMme deﬁciency. Our
ﬁndings show that aminopeptidase A (APN), aminopeptidase N
(APN), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which were immuno-
puriﬁed from the membrane fraction of mouse brains, displayed
Aβ-degrading activity (Fig 7A). Among them, DPP4 exhibited the
highest activity. Protein contents were in the order of APN > APA >
DPP4, but DPP4 had the highest speciﬁc activity (Fig 7C), suggesting
that it plays a signiﬁcant role in truncating amino-terminal amino
acids (DA). Our results showed that the expression levels of APN,
DPP4, and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like (QPCTL) were
up-regulated by Mme deﬁciency, whereas the expression level of
thyrotropin-releasing hormone–degrading enzyme, a pyroglutamyl
aminopeptidase, was decreased (Fig 7D and E).

An unresolved issue in understanding the mechanism of Aβ de-
position in the human brain, an upstream event triggering the AD
cascade (Selkoe & Hardy, 2016), is the difference in the primary
structure of Aβ between the pathologically deposited and physi-
ologically secreted forms (Saido et al, 1995, 1996; Saido & Iwata,
2006). Gravina et al demonstrated using end-speciﬁc antibodies
that most Aβin the AD brain is amino-terminally truncated and that
Aβ1-42 accounts for only 10–20% of total Aβx-42 (Gravina et al, 1995),
whereas Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 are the major variants secreted by cells
(Selkoe & Hardy, 2016). The actual amount of a physiologically
secreted form, Aβ1(L-Asp)-42, in the AD brain was even smaller (less
than 5%) (Fig S1). This speciﬁc form accounts for >40% of total Aβx-
42 as quantitated against varying amounts of synthetic Aβ peptides,
in agreement withKuo et al (1997); Russo et al (1997). Thus, among
the structural variants known to be present in AD brains, Aβ3pE-42
is the most abundant in both early- and late-onset cases. The next
most abundant Aβ variant after Aβ3pE-42 was Aβ1iD-42, which was
estimated to be 26% of the total Aβ (Fig S1). Moro et al (2018)
observed that the amount of Aβ3pE-42 was correlated well with
phosphor-tau load in AD and age-matched control brains rather
than that of Aβ1iD-42; thus, deposition of Aβ3pE-42 appears to be
associated with AD pathogenesis.

Metabolic resistance of Aβ3pE-42, an epitope of donanemab Iwata et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202402650 vol 7 | no 12 | e202402650 7o f1 7 Aβ3pE-42 has been shown to exhibit greater neurotoxicity and
oligomerization properties than Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 (He & Barrow,
1999; Jawhar et al, 2011;Nussbaum et al, 2012; Frost et al, 2013; Wulff
et al, 2016;Dunkelmann et al, 2018a,2018b). Conversion of Aβ1-42 to
Aβ3pE-42 results in the loss of one positive and two negative
charges at the N-terminus of Aβ (Saido et al, 1995), and may thus
account for its unique physical, chemical, and biological charac-
teristics. The generation of this peculiar Aβ variant may thus play a
major pathogenic role in AD development and resulted in the
discovery of donanemab. The mechanism by which Aβ3pE-42 is
generated is likely to be mediated by amino-terminal truncation of
Aβ1-42 by exopeptidase(s), such as aminopeptidases or dipeptidyl
peptidases, followed by cyclization of the amino-terminal gluta-
mate residue in Aβ3pE-42 (Fig S10). The cyclization may be spon-
taneous or enzymatic (Cynis et al, 2006; Antonyan et al, 2018), but to
our knowledge, substantial conversion of A β3E-42 to Aβ3pE-42
under physiological conditions has never been demonstrated
even in vitro (Shirotani et al, 2002).
Our ﬁndings suggest the following hypothetical scenario for
pathological A β3pE-42 deposition in the human brain, as the
conversion of Aβ3E-42 to this speciﬁc form can be achieved by a
single chemical step involving d ehydration/cyclization of the
amino-terminal glutamate residue ( Fig S10 ). Under normal
conditions, the NEP-dependent pathway, which is constitutively
active, is sufﬁcient to catabolize Aβ1-42 without amino-terminal
proteolysis to produce A β2A-42, A β3E-42, and A β4F-42. This
conclusion was reached because aminopeptidase inhibitors did
not block the in vivo degradation of radiolabeled Aβ1-42 (Iwata
et al, 2000), and because Aβ1(Ac-Asp)-42 and Aβ1(D-Asp
)-42, both
of which are resistant to mammalian aminopeptidase activity

(ΔDA)-Q-F KI mice, the third amino acid of Aβ (E) in
AppNL-(ΔDA)-F is converted to Q. These experimental
designs were made based on our previous
observation, showing that cortical neurons
expressing APP cDNAs with the NL-(ΔDA)-Q

produced Aβ3pE-40/42 (Shirotani et al, 2002).

Metabolic resistance of Aβ3pE-42, an epitope of donanemab Iwata et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202402650 vol 7 | no 12 | e202402650 9o f1 7 (Harigaya et al, 1995 ), underwent in vivo degradation in a
manner similar to that of Aβ1-42 (Table 1). However, under ab-
errant conditions, such as a signiﬁcant reduction in NEP activity
presumably caused by brain aging processes and AD develop-
ment, the NEP-independent pathway(s) may be opened and
Aβ1-42 may be processed by aminopeptidases or dipeptidyl
peptidases, which are present in the extracellular milieu in the
brain (Mentlein, 2004; Banegas et al, 2006; Hui, 2007; Khosla et al,
2022)( Figs 7 and S10). In support of this, these exopeptidases
were abnormally up-regulated in an age-dependent manner to
compensate for reduced NEP-mediated endoproteolysis. Al-
though most of the amino-terminally truncated A βx-42
underwent further proteo lysis, a small portion of A β3E-42
could be converted to the catabolism-resistant form by QPCT
or QPCTL (Fig S10), increasing the probability of pathological Aβ
deposition.
Interestingly, we detected A β3pE-16 and trace quantities of
Aβ2A-16 and Aβ3E-16 in Mme
−/−APP-Tg mouse brain (Fig 3B). Fur-
thermore, Mme deﬁciency increased not only the histochemical
quantity of amyloid plaques but also the biochemical quantity of
Aβ3pE-42 in the soluble fraction of APP-Tg brains as analyzed by WB
and ELISA (Figs 4 and S6). The presence of Aβ3pE-42 in a soluble
form even before plaque formation in the human brain (Russo et al,
1997) indicates the presence of a dynamic equilibrium between the
liquid and solid phases. These observations imply that the
N-terminal truncation of Aβ2A-x and conversion from Aβ3E-x to
Aβ3pE-x may take place both in a solid state such as the core of
amyloid plaques and in a liquid–solid transition state, such as
formation of amyloid plaques from soluble Aβ monomers and
oligomers. Aβ3pE-42–positive signals corresponding to PiB-binding
sites were detected preferentially in the core of amyloid plaques,
whereas Aβ1-42–positive signals were observed in larger amyloid

state, it is difﬁcult to account for this morphological difference.
The relative amount of Aβ3pE-42 per total Aβ in the APP-Tg and
App KI mouse models was less than 1% (Figs 4D and Eand S9C) and
did not recapitulate the massive accumulation of Aβ3pE-42 in the
human brain (Fig S1), even if Aβdeposition precedes disease onset
by more than two decades (Bateman et al, 2012). Thus, APP-Tg mice
and App KI mice, which accumulate mainly full-length Aβ1-42, but
little Aβ3pE-42, fail to exhibit major subsequent pathologies (tau
pathology and neurodegeneration) even after humanization of the
entire murine Mapt gene (Hashimoto et al, 2019; Saito et al, 2019).
Because it is not feasible to spatiotemporally analyze the depo-
sition of Aβ3pE-42 in the human brain, we can only make an as-
sumption based on such mouse model data. Yang et al showed by
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry the presence of various Aβ peptides
in different AD brains, whereasApp KI mice uniformly accumulated
Aβ1-42 (Yang et al, 2022), suggesting that Aβ1-42 undergoes trun-
cation over decades after pathological deposition in the human
brain. They also found“Type I and IIﬁlaments” in AD brain and only
of “Type II”ﬁlaments in theApp KI mouse brain. Because both Aβ1-
42 and Aβ3pE-42 are abundant in AD brains (Fig S1) and because
Aβ1-42 is the predominant variant inApp KI mouse brain (Figs 6B
and S9), Types I and II are likely composed of Aβ3pE-42 and Aβ1-42,
respectively. Although this assumption needs to be experimentally
validated, it may explain why Aβ in App KI or APP-Tg mice can be
extracted
by GuHCl (Kawarabayashi et al, 2001; Saito et al, 2014),
whereas that in AD brains requires formic acid for Aβ extraction
(Harigaya et al, 1995; Saido et al, 1995; Kawarabayashi et al, 2001).
The difference in the quantity of Aβ3pE-42 accumulated in the
human brain and in the mouse model remains an important issue
to be solved.
Glutamate cyclization of Aβ3E-42 is a deﬁnite ﬁnal process that
results in Aβ3pE-42 production ( Fig S10), and it is possible to
regulate the production of Aβ3pE-42 by pharmacological or die-
tary means (Hennekens et al, 2015;Coimbra et al, 2019; Vijayan &
Zhang, 2019). Alternatively, the ubiquitously present pyroglutamyl
peptidase activity (Cummins & O’Connor, 1998), which was also
down-regulated by Mme deﬁciency (Fig 7E), would convert Aβ3pE-
42 to Aβ4F-42. In any event, it is advantageous that both Aβ3E-42
and Aβ4F-42 are even more labile to in vivo catabolism and less
pathologically prone to deposition in the brain than the physi-
ological Aβ1-42 form (Fig 1 and Table 1). Also, selective activation
of NEP in the cortex and hippocampus is another therapeutic
strategy (Saito et al, 2005; Watamura et al, 2022, 2024; Hori et al,
2023).
Lastly, our observations suggest that there may exist an “N-
end rule” for Aβ catabolism. The original “N-end rule ” for in-
tracellular protein cataboli sm is closely associated with a
speciﬁc class of ubiquitin ligases that recognize the amino-
terminal structure of substrate proteins ( Dougan et al, 2012 ;
Kw
on & Ciechanover, 2017; Dissmeyer et al, 2018). In this study, we
demonstrated that the amino-terminal structure of A β inﬂu-
ences its rate of metabolism. Although it is not yet clear how
generalizable this “N-end rule” is for extracellular protein ca-
tabolism, there may exist a common mechanism that could
account for the catabolism of relatively large and hydrophobic
peptides represented by Aβ.
Materials and Methods
Radiolabeled peptides
Synthesis, puriﬁcation, structural integrity, and subsequent in vivo
analysis of radiolabeled Aβ peptides were performed as described
for 3H/14C-Aβ1-42 (Iwata et al, 2000). The Aβx-42 variants including
Aβ1-42 were synthesized simultaneously from the carboxyl-
terminus. When the sequential coupling of Fmoc amino acids
proceeded to the point where Aβ17L-42 was produced, a fraction of
the peptide–resin complex was isolated and subjected to depro-
tection and cleavage from the resin. The remaining portion of the
peptide–resin was used to further synthesize Aβ4F-42, Aβ3E-42,
Aβ3pE-42, Aβ2A-42, and Aβ1(D-Asp)-42 in a similar manner. Acet-
ylated Aβ1-42 (Aβ1[Ac-Asp]-42) was produced by reacting Aβ1-42–
containing resin with acetic anhydride after removal of the Fmoc
group by piperazine. After extensive deprotection and cleavage with
TFA, ethanedithiol, anisole, and dimethyl sulﬁde from the resin,
followed byﬁltration, the peptides were washed three times by cold
ether precipitation and subjected to size-exclusion chromatogra-
phy (Shodex OHpak SB-802.5 HQ; Showa Denko) equilibrated with
dimethylformamide. After removal of the solvent in the presence of
an azeotropic solvent under vacuum, the puriﬁed peptides were
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored in aliquots at−80°C until
use. The structural integrity of the peptides was con ﬁrmed by
reversed-phase HPLC analysis (where the peptides were eluted as
single peaks), peptide mapping with lysyl endopeptidase, direct
chemical sequencing, and mass spectrometric analysis.
Antibodies
Anti-Aβ antibodies speci ﬁc to amino-terminal structures or
carboxyl-terminal structures of Aβ variants were prepared as de-
scribed previously (Saido et al, 1996) and were used for Western blot
(WB) analysis and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) at the
concentration of 1μg/ml. N1D and N3pE, which were used widely
throughout the present study, are rabbit polyclonal antibodies
speciﬁc to the amino-terminals of A β1(D)-x and Aβ3(pE)-x, re-
spectively. Other antibodies used in the present study are as fol-
lows: anti-pan Aβ antibody (mouse monoclonal 4G8, 1μg/ml for
WB, 2.5 μg/ml for IHC; Millipore), anti-ApoE (goat polyclonal, sc-
6384, 0.4μg/ml for WB; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-
α1-antichymotrypsin (AP15343PU-N, 0.2 μg/ml for WB; Acris
Antibodies).
Human materials
Frozen brain tissues from the temporal cortex were obtained from
the Manchester Brain Bank and frozen/stored at −80°C. Experi-
ments using the human materials (Western blotting) have been
approved
by the Ethical Committee of RIKEN.

Metabolic resistance of Aβ3pE-42, an epitope of donanemab Iwata et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202402650 vol 7 | no 12 | e202402650 11 of 17 Quantum Science and Technology. Male, 8 –10-wk-old, Sprague
Dawley rats used for in vivo analysis of metabolic rates of radio-
labeled Aβx-42 peptides were obtained from Japan SLC.Mme-KO
mice (Lu et al, 1995) and APP-Tg mice (APP23) (Sturchler-Pierrat
et al, 1997) were kindly provided by Dr. Craig Gerard (Harvard
Medical School) and Dr. Matthias Staufenbiel (Novartis Institutes for
Biomedical Research), respectively. APP-Tg mice with a hetero-
zygous Mme-deﬁcient background (Mme
+/−APP-Tg) were produced
by crossbreeding APP23 mice, which overexpress human-type
APP-carrying double mutations (KM670/671NL), and homozygous
Mme-deﬁcient mice (Mme
−/−); Mme+/+APP-Tg andMme−/−APP-Tg lit-
termates were produced by breeding femaleMme+/−APP-Tg and male
Mme+/−APP-Tg mice, as described previously (Iwata et al, 2013). All
mice were on the same genetic background (C57BL/6J). Both male
and female mice were analyzed at the ages indicated in theﬁgure
legends. In the same way, Mme
+/+App KI ( AppNL-F) mice and
Mme−/−AppNL-F littermates were produced usingAppNL-F/NL-F KI mice
(Saito et al, 2014). They were housed in plastic cages. One to three
rats per cage (one toﬁve mice per cage) received food (CE2; Clea
Japan, Inc.) and water ad lib, and were maintained on a 12/12-h
light–dark cycle (lights on at 09:00, off at 21:00).
Development of App
NL-(ΔDA)-F and AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F KI mice
These mouse strains were developed according to the production
method of App
NL-F KI mice (Saito et al, 2014). First, we modiﬁed
the targeting vector used to generate theAppNL-F KI mice. InAppNL-
(ΔDA)-F KI mouse strain, the genes encoding two amino acids
(aspartic acid and alanine at positions 1 and 2 in the Aβ sequence)
were deleted from the targeting vector. InAppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F KI mouse
strain, the two amino acids were similarly deleted and one point
mutation from glutamic acid to glutamine at position 3 in the Aβ
sequence was added to the targeting vector. Using these targeting
vectors, we performed the same manipulations as in the devel-
opment of theApp
NL-F KI mice. Theﬁrst-generation mice obtained
by gene targeting were crossed with EIIa-Cre transgenic mice (JAX:
003724; The Jackson Laboratory) to remove the neo resistance gene
by the Cre-loxP system, and then backcrossed at leastﬁve gen-
erations to establish a C57BL/6J genetic background as previously
described (Saito et al, 2014).
Immunohistochemistry and its quantitative assessment
Mouse brains wereﬁxed by transcardial perfusion with phosphate-
buffered 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraf-
ﬁn. Four-micrometer-thick sections were mounted onto aminoprop
yltriethoxysilane-coated glass slides. The brain sections were im-
munostained using anti-A β antibodies and visualized by the
avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex procedure (Vectastain ABC kits;
Vector Laboratories) using 3,3-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen.
Sections were observed with a light microscope, Provis AX80
(Olympus Optical), using a 4X objective and a 1.5X digital zoom, and
digital images were captured with a DP70 digital microscope camera
(Olympus Optical). The density of immunoreactive Aβ deposits in
the hippocampal formation and neocortex was measured using
image analysis software, MetaMorph, ver. 6.1 (Universal Imaging
Corporation, Downingtown, USA), after the raw images had been
inverted using image-editing software (Adobe Photoshop CS5;
Adobe Systems, Inc.) by an investigator blinded as to sample
identity. To reduce the variance among tissue sections, we used the
average of data from three sections per mouse as an individual
value.
Alternatively, amyloid pathology was detected using biotinylated
secondary antibody and tyramide signal ampli ﬁcation (Akoya
Biosciences). Before mounting, the sections were treated, when
required, with Hoechst 33342 diluted in PBS. Data images were
obtained using NanoZoomer Digital Pathology C9600 (Hamamatsu
Photonics) and EVOS M5000 Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc). Immunoreactive signals were quantiﬁed by Deﬁniens Tis-
sue Studio (Deﬁniens).
Lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C) digestion and mass spectrometry
Monoisotopic mass values of A β variants in the detergent-
insoluble/formic acid –soluble fractions were measured by a
Microﬂex II MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in
reﬂector mode, using standard operating parameters after the
digestion of endoproteinase Lys-C, as previously described (Moore
et al, 2012). Samples were dissolved with 70% (vol/vol) formic acid
and subjected to sonication for 3 min. The formic acid was then
evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 20μl of unbuffered
10 mM NH
4HCO3 solution, subjected to sonication, and digested
with 15 ng of endoproteinase Lys-C (Fujiﬁlm Wako Chemicals) for
15 h at 37°C. The resulting peptide fragments were adsorbed on a
MonoTip mini C18 pipette tip (GL Sciences, Inc.), desalted with 5%
(vol/vol) methanol containing 0.1% (vol/vol) TFA, and eluted with
5 μl of 60% (vol/vol) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (vol/vol) TFA. The
eluate was mixed with an equal volume of a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid solution (10 mg/ml in 50% [vol/vol] acetonitrile; Tokyo
Chemical Industry Co.), and 1μl thereof was spotted on a stainless-
steel Bruker MALDI 96 target plate (Bruker Daltonics). A baseline
correction and anti-aliasing of mass spectra were carried out using
FlexAnalysis 2.2 (Bruker Daltonics). External calibration of MALDI-
TOF mass was carried out using singly charged monoisotopic peaks
of peptide standards.
Western blotting
Soluble and detergent-insoluble/formic acid–extractable fractions
were prepared from mouse brains, and protein concentrations
were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). An
equivalent amount of protein from each fraction was separated by
5–20% gradient SDS– polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred electrophoretically to 0.22-μ m nitrocellulose mem-
branes (Protoran, Whatman GmbH). The membranes were boiled in
PBS for 3 min to gain high sensitivity. The blot was probed with anti-
Aβ antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-
rabbit IgG (GE HealthCare Japan). An immunoreactive band on the
membrane was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (GE HealthCare Japan), and the band intensity was determined
with a densitometer, LAS4000 (GE HealthCare Japan), using Science
Lab 97 Image Gauge software (ver. 3.0.1; GE HealthCare Japan).
Immunoreactive protein content in each sample was calculated
based on a standard curve constructed with synthesized A β

ments was repeated at least three times. Formic acid–extractable
fractions from neocortices of early-onset AD and late-onset AD
patients were prepared according to the method described pre-
viously (Saido et al, 1995).
Aβ ELISA
Mouse cerebral cortices were homogenized in buffer A (50 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitor cocktail) using
Multi-Beads Shocker (Saito et al, 2014). The homogenized samples
were directed to centrifugation at 200,000g for 20 min at 4°C, and
the supernatant was collected as a Tris-buffered saline (TS) –
soluble fraction. The pellet was loosened with buffer A, centrifuged
at 200,000g for 5 min at 4°C, and then dissolved in 6 M guanidine
HCl (GuHCl) buffer. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the
sample was sonicated at 25°C for 1 min. Subsequently, the sample
was centrifuged at 200,000g for 20 min at 25°C and the supernatant
collected as a GuHCl fraction. The amounts of Aβx-40, Aβx-42, Aβ1-
40, Aβ1-42, Aβ3pE-40, and Aβ3pE-42 in each fraction were deter-
mined by sandwich ELISA kits: Fujiﬁlm Wako #292-62301, Fujiﬁlm
Wako #298-62401, and Immuno-Biological Laboratories [IBL] #27713,
#27711, #27418, and #27716, respectively.
Autoradiographic and immunohistochemical labeling and
PET imaging
Radiosynthesis of [
11C]PiB was conducted as described else-
where (Maeda et al, 2007). Six-μm-thick paraformaldehyde- ﬁxed
brain sections from 24-mo-old Mme+/+APP-Tg, Mme+/−APP-Tg,
and Mme−/−APP-Tg mice were incubated in 50 mM Tris –HCl
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5% ethanol and [11C]PiB (37 MBq/l, ~200
pM) at room temperature for 60 min. After the reaction, the

sequently dried under warm blowing air and contacted to an
imaging plate (Fuji Photo Film) for 1 h. Imaging plate data were
scanned by a BAS5000 system (Fuji Photo Film). The intensities of
radioactive signals in the neo cortex and hippocampus were
measured by Multi Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film). Speci ﬁc
binding of [
11C]PiB to amyloid in these regions was calculated as
the difference in signal intensity versus the cerebellum, which
lacks marked plaque lesions.
After attenuation of radioactivity, brain sections used for the au-
tographic assay were reacted with rabbit polyclonal antibody against
Aβ3pE (dilution, 1:50,000) (Saido et al, 1995, 1996), and immunolabeling
was developed with a tyramide signal ampliﬁcation-Direct kit (Akoya
Biosciences).
Longitudinal PET scans were conducted for Mme
+/+APP-Tg,
Mme+/−APP-Tg, and Mme−/−APP-Tg mice at 9, 13, and 20 mo of
age, as stated elsewhere (Tai et al, 2005), with a microPET Focus
220 animal scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA) designed
for rodents and small monkeys, which provides 95 transaxial
slices 0.815 mm (center-to-cent er) apart, a 19.0-cm transaxial
ﬁeld of view, and a 7.6-cm axial ﬁeld of view (Tai et al, 2005).
Before the scans, the mice were anesthetized with 1.5% (vol/vol)
isoﬂurane. After transmission scans for attenuation correction
using a 68Ge-68Ga point source, emission scans were performed
for 60 min in a 3D list mode with an energy window of 350–750
keV, immediately after the i ntravenous injection of [
11C]PiB
(32.0 ± 7.1 MBq). All list-mode data were sorted into 3D sinograms,
which were then Fourier-rebinned into 2D sinograms (frames,
10 × 1, 8 × 5, and 1 × 10 min). Summation images from 30 to 60 min
after [
11C]PiB injection were reconstructed with maximum a
posteriori reconstruction, and dynamic images were recon-
structed with ﬁltered back-projection using a 0.5-mm Hanning
ﬁlter. Volumes of interest were placed on multiple brain areas
using PMOD image analysis software (PMOD Group) with refer-
ence to an MRI template generated in a previous study (Maeda
et al, 2007). The radioligand bindin g in the hippocampus and
neocortex was quantiﬁed by calculating the binding potential (a
combined measure of the density of target molecules and af-
ﬁn i t yo ft h et r a c e r )b a s e do nt h es p e c iﬁc binding compared with

Immunopuriﬁcation of peptidases
Coupling of Dynabeads protein G (Life Technologies Japan) with
anti-mouse APA/BP1/6C3 antigen antibody, anti-mouse APN/CD13
antibody, or anti-mouse DPP4/CD26 antibody was carried out using
20 mM dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride in 0.2 M trietha-
nolamine (pH 8.2) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A
Triton X-100 –solubilized membrane fraction from neocortices
of mice was precleared with Dynabeads protein G, and then in-
cubated with each antibody coupled with Dynabeads protein G
overnight at 4°C. The supernatant was removed from the peptidase–
antibody–protein beads complex, and after several passages of
washing, the peptidase was eluted from the complex with 25 mM
citrate buffer (pH 3) into a tube containing 0.5N NaOH solution to
neutralize pH. Immunopuriﬁ ed peptidases presented a single
band on silver-stained SDS –PAGE; conﬁrmation that they were
desired peptidases was obtained by characterization based on
substrate speciﬁcity, inhibitor sensitivity, and molecular mass on
SDS–PAGE (data not shown).
Measurement of peptidase activities
Two methods consisting of an Aβ digestion assay using HPLC and a
ﬂuorometric assay using artiﬁcial substrates were used.
To assay Aβ-degrading activity by APA or APN, a reaction mixture
consisting of immunopuriﬁed mouse APA (120 pg) or mouse APN
(400 pg), Aβ
1-40 (2 μg; Bachem AG), 1 mM CaCl2, cOmplete, EDTA-free
(Roche Diagnostics), 0.1 mM ZLLLal (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan),
10 μM pepstatin A (Peptide Institute), and 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) in
a total volume 50μl was incubated for 5 h at 37°C, and terminated
by the addition of 450μl of 0.1% TFA. For the assay of Aβ-degrading
activity by DPP4, 5 mM EDTA instead of 1 mM CaCl2 and cOmplete,
EDTA-free and immunopuriﬁed mouse DPP4 (58 pg) instead of the
above peptidases were added to the above reaction mixture.
Amounts of remaining intact Aβ and its proteolytic fragments were
analyzed by HPLC (HP 1100 series; Agilent Technologies) connected
to a UV detector. A reversed-phase polymer column (Capcell Pak

0.1% TFA was used to separate peptides. Bound peptides were
eluted by a linear gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA from 10 to
40 min at aﬂow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The APA- or APN-dependent Aβ-
degrading activity was determined based on the decrease in the
rate of digestion caused by 0.1 mM amastatin, a speciﬁc inhibitor of
APA and APN. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA
protein assay kit (Pierce). For DPP4, 2 mM PMSF, a speciﬁc inhibitor
of DPP4, was employed instead of amastatin. The activity was
represented by the amount of degradation ofμmol of a substrate/
mg protein of enzyme/min.
APA-, APN-, and DPP4-dependent peptidase activities in Triton
X-100–solubilized membrane fractions from neocortices of mice
were ﬂuorometrically assayed in the same assay mixtures as above
except that 0.2 mM Glu-MCA, 0.1 mM Ala-MCA, and Gly-Pro-MCA
(Bachem), respectively, were used as a substrate. Activities were
determined from theﬂuorescence intensity at Ex. 390 nm and Em.
460 nm, based on the decrease in the rate of digestion caused by
0.1 mM amastatin or 2 mM PMSF, as mentioned above.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from hippocampi of 18-mo-old maleMme
+/+
APP-Tg and Mme−/−APP-Tg mice using High Pure RNA Tissue Kit
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Afterﬁrst-strand cDNA was synthesized
using PrimeScript reverse transcriptase–PCR Kit (Takara Bio Inc.),
qRT-PCR was conducted using Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio Inc.) and a
SmartCycler II system (Takara Bio Inc.) with the following two-step
ampliﬁcation proﬁle: 40 cycles of 5 s at 95°C and 20 s at 60°C.
Relative quantiﬁcation of Qpct (gene symbol for QC) and Qpctl
(gene symbol for QCL) RNA expression was carried out by nor-
malization to the expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate de-
hydrogenase (GAPDH). Nucleotide sequences of the probes and
forward/reverse primers were Mm_Qpct-Probe (ACCAACCAACTG-
GATGGCATGGATCTGT) and Mm_Qpct-F (CCTCACCCTCCTGGATCAAGA)/
Mm_Qpct-R (GGGAATGTTGGATTTGCTGCTC) for mouse Qpct,
Mm_Qpctl-Probe (AGGCTACGTTGCAGTCCCTGTCGGC) and Mm_Qpctl-
F (GGCAATCTCCAAGTGAGAAAGTTC)/Mm_Qpctl-R (GGGTCCAGTTCAA-
CATGCCAG) for mouseQpctl, and Mm_GAPDH-Probe (TGGTGGACCT
CATGGCCTACATGGCC) and Mm_GAPDH-F (CAAGCTCATTTCCTGGTATG
ACAA)/Mm_GAPDH-R (TTGGGATAGGGCCTCTCTTGC) for mouse
Gapdh.
Statistics
All data are shown as the mean ± SEM. For comparisons of the
means among three or more groups, statistical analysis was
performed by one-way, two-way, or repeated-measures two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc test; the
Student –Newman –Keuls or the Tukey test was applied if the data
passed the Shapiro –Wilk normality and the Brown –Forsythe
equal variance tests. If the normality test or the equal variance
test was not passed at ANOVA, the Kruskal –Wallis one-way
ANOVA on the ranks was performed. These analyses were per-
formed using SigmaPlot software ver.14.0 (Systat Software Inc) or
GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad software).P-values below

http://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202402650
Vol 7 | No 12 | e202402650 ","The article discusses metabolic resistance of Aβ3pE-42, an epitope targeted by donanemab, a therapeutic antibody for Alzheimer's disease. It explores factors affecting the degradation and clearance of this specific amyloid-beta peptide fragment in the brain. Key points include the involvement of somatostatin and the dopaminergic system in promoting neprilysin-mediated degradation of Aβ peptides. Studies indicate that while Aβ3pE-42 is a target for donanemab, its metabolic resistance may impact therapeutic efficacy. The research highlights mechanisms such as α-endosulfin-KATP channel pathways and the role of specific brain systems in modulating Aβ clearance.","The amyloid β peptide (Aβ), starting with pyroglutamate (pE) at position 3 and ending at position 42 (Aβ3pE-42), predominantly accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease. Consistently, donanemab, a therapeutic antibody raised against Aβ3pE-42, has been shown to be effective in recent clinical trials. Although the primary Aβ produced physiologically is Aβ1-40/42, an explanation for how and why this physiological Aβ is converted to the pathological form remains elusive. Here, we present experimental evidence that accounts for the aging-associated Aβ3pE-42 deposition: Aβ3pE-42 was metabolically more stable than other Aβx-42 variants; deficiency of neprilysin, the major Aβ-degrading enzyme, induced a relatively selective deposition of Aβ3pE-42 in both APP transgenic and App knock-in mouse brains; Aβ3pE-42 deposition always colocalized with Pittsburgh compound B–positive cored plaques in APP transgenic mouse brains; and under aberrant conditions, such as a significant reduction in neprilysin activity, aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like were up-regulated in the progression of aging, and a proportion of Aβ1-42 may be processed to Aβ3pE-42. Our findings suggest that anti-Aβ therapies are more effective if given before Aβ3pE-42 deposition.","Senile plaques, which are one of the key pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are composed of amyloidβ peptides (Aβs) with a variety of secondary and tertiary structures because of post-translational modifications (Saido et al, 1995, 1996). This heterogeneity appears to affect catabolism and aggregation rates, resulting in structural changes in plaques. It has been reported repeatedly that most of Aβ in the brains of aged humans and in Down syndrome starts with pyroglutamate (pE) at position 3 and ends at position 42 (Aβ3pE-42) (Harigaya et al, 1995; Saido et al, 1995, 1996; Iwatsubo et al, 1996; Lemere et al, 1996; Kawarabayashi et al, 2001; Frost et al, 2013). In contrast, transgenic (Tg) mice over-expressing human APP with pathogenic mutations primarily accumulate Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 (Sturchler-Pierrat et al, 1997; Kawarabayashi et al, 2001). We reassessed this observation in the brains of AD patients quantitatively using a panel of antibodies capable of distinguishing among amino-terminal variants or among carboxyl-terminal variants of Aβ and verified that the predominant Aβ variant in the brains of AD patients is indeed Aβ3pE-42 (>40% of total Aβ)(Fig S1). There is, however, some discrepancy among different reports regarding the quantity of Aβ variants, which vary depending on the methods employed. For instance, the group led by Michel Goedert, who used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and LC-MS/MS to resolve the cryo-EM structure of Aβ42 filaments from human brains, recently indicated that Aβ3pE-42 was a minor variant in the brains of AD patients and App knock-in (KI) mice (Yang et al, 2022). This inconsistency can be accounted for by the unique physicochemical nature of Aβ3pE-42, which is seldom recovered from reversed-phase HPLC under normal conditions (Table S1). However, the use of a heated (50°C) basic solvent containing betaine and limited proteolysis using lysyl endopeptidase allows full recovery in HPLC and detection by mass spectrometry, respectively. These observations explain the relatively low estimation of Aβ3pE-42 levels in some prior studies as well (Glenner & Wong, 1984, 2012; Wong et al, 1985; Mori et al, 1992). Consistently, Güntert et al (2006) successfully detected Aβ3pE-42 in the human brain by mass spectrometry after sufficient proteolytic digestion. It is notable that a therapeutic antibody raised against this variant, donanemab, has been shown to be effective in recent clinical trials (Demattos et al, 2012; Sims et al, 2023). The selective deposition of this physiologically rare Aβ variant in the human brain appears to be attributed to its presumed metabolic stability and aggregation propensity because pyroglutamyl peptide is resistant to major aminopeptidases except for pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (Mori et al, 1992). In accordance with this, an immediate aminopeptidase-sensitive precursor of Aβ3pE-42, Aβ3E-42, is a very minor component in AD brain (Fig S1) (Table S2). However, our observations of in vivo Aβ1-42 catabolism demonstrated that specific endoproteolysis mediated by neprilysin (NEP), but not aminopeptidase, is the major rate-limiting step with Aβ10-37 as a catabolic intermediate (Iwata et al, 2000). Thus, it is unclear about the mechanisms underlying generation of Aβ3pE-42. In addition, the presence of Aβ variants with different amino-terminal structures in the AD brains may be explained by the assumption that they have different life spans. The present study aims to examine whether the amino-terminal structure of Aβx-42 influences its catabolic rate in vivo based on the diversity of its amino-terminal structure observed in the AD brain (Fig S1). The study also serves as an initial attempt to address the question “What determines the life spans of extracellular peptides, such as Aβs, in the brain?” For this purpose, we synthesized amino-terminal variants of Aβ internally radiolabeled with 3H at residues 2, 4, 9, and 17 and with 14C at 20, 29, 34, 40, and 42 (Fig S2) and analyzed their catabolic rates in the rat hippocampal tissue according to a previously reported method (Iwata et al, 2000). Furthermore, to elucidate possible pathways of Aβ3pE-40/42 generation, we analyzed amyloid pathologies in the brains of APP-Tg (Sturchler-Pierrat et al, 1997) and App KI mice (Saito et al, 2014) using various experimental paradigms, such as quantitative Western blot (WB) analysis, ELISA, mass spectrometry, and image analysis for immunohistochemistry and positron emission tomography (PET) of amyloid. We found that a deficiency of NEP, the major Aβ-degrading enzyme, up-regulated the compensatory pathway, where aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like (QPCTL) are involved, resulting in the formation and relatively selective accumulation of Aβ3pE-42 in the brains of both APP-Tg and App KI mice.","Catabolism of Aβx-42 variants in vivo The synthesized variants included Aβ1D(L-Asp)-42, Aβ1rD(D-Asp)-42, Aβ1AcD(acetyl-Asp)-42, Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, Aβ3pE-42, Aβ4F-42, and Aβ17L-42 (Fig S2). The results demonstrate that subtle differences in the amino-terminal structure have a profound influence on the way Aβ is catabolized (Figs 1A–F and S3, Table 1). First, Aβ3pE-42 was much more resistant to in vivo catabolism than Aβ1-42; most of it remained uncatabolized even 60 min after administration into the hippocampus, whereas Aβ1-42 was almost fully degraded within 30 min. This observation is consistent with the presumption attributing the selective deposition of Aβ3pE-42 in the human brain to its metabolic stability (Saido et al, 1995). In contrast, Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, and Aβ4F-42 were catabolized even more rapidly than Aβ1-42. These results clearly indicate the presence of structural determinants of life span in the amino-terminal sequence of Aβ. Again, these truncated Aβ peptides without pyroglutamate are consistently seen as minor components deposited in the senile human brain (Fig S1)(Saido et al, 1996). The catabolic stability of these Aβ variants therefore correlates well with their tendencies to be pathologically deposited in the human brain. The Aβ17L-42 (p3 fragment) appeared to have a longer in vivo half-life than Aβ1-42, but the difference was not statistically significant (Table 1). These observations also indicate that the loss of the first two amino acid residues, DA, is not the cause of the metabolic stability of Aβ3pE-42. Loss of the α-amino group and R-configuration of the first amino acid did not affect the metabolic rates, because Aβ1AcD-42 and Aβ1rD-42 were degraded at a rate similar to that of Aβ1-42 (Table 1 and Fig S3). The specific structure of Aβ3pE-42 seems to generate an anti-catabolism signal, as discussed below. The consistently facilitated catabolism of Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, and Aβ4F-42 also indicates that the amino-terminal aspartic residue of Aβ1-42 is involved in the regulation of the catabolic rate, generating an anti-catabolism signal that is milder than that of Aβ3pE-42. Because the rate-limiting step of Aβ1-42 degradation is catalyzed by NEP (Iwata et al, 2000, 2001), the conversion of Aβ1-42 to Aβ3pE-42 is likely to decelerate this process. The facilitation of catabolism by removal of aspartate from Aβ1-42, however, may possibly be accounted for by two distinct mechanisms: one is conversion to better substrates for NEP, and the other is participation of alternative catabolic pathway(s) with respect to Aβ2A-42, Aβ3E-42, and Aβ4F-42. In any case, NEP may contribute to catabolism, because a catabolic intermediate similar to Aβ10-37 detected during Aβ1-42 degradation (Iwata et al, 2000) was observed (Fig 1, green arrowheads). A detailed analysis of the peptide fragments generated during the in vivo catabolism is required to clarify this notion. Effect of Mme deficiency on N1D- and N3pE-positive amyloid plaque deposition in the APP-Tg mouse brain We subsequently examined the effect of Mme (gene nomenclature of NEP) deficiency on deposition of amyloid plaques immunoreactive to various anti-Aβ antibodies including N1D and N3pE in the brains of APP-Tg mice (Fig 2A and B). Mme deficiency modestly increased N1D-positive amyloid plaques but induced a drastic increase in N3pE-positive plaques, particularly at and after 18 mo of age. Other immunostaining and thioflavin staining patterns were almost similar to that of N1D immunostaining. Large plaques were detected in the sections immunostained for N1D (Fig 2A) and plaque size distribution for both N1D- and N3pE-positive amyloid plaques. Interestingly, we found that plaque size was roughly divided into three clusters: smaller/cored plaques (≤300 μm2), intermediate plaques (1,500–4,500 μm2), and larger plaques (>20,000 μm2)(Figs 2C and S4). The numbers of both N1D- and N3pE-positive amyloid plaques presented (Fig 2B) with a distinct size distribution: N3pE immunoreactivity tended to be present in smaller/cored plaques (≤300 μm2) and intermediate plaques (1,500–4,500 μm2), whereas N1D was present in larger plaques (>20,000 μm2) in addition to the clusters of smaller/cored plaques and intermediate plaques. The relative increase in total N3pE-positive area by Mme deficiency was significantly larger than that of N1D-positive area (Fig 2D). Given that NEP expression invariably declines with age (Iwata et al, 2002; Wang et al, 2003; Russo et al, 2005; Hellstrom-Lindahl et al, 2008), it is notable that even heterozygous Mme deficiency, presenting an ~50% reduction in NEP activity (Iwata et al, 2001), thus resulted in a relative increase in the ratio of Aβ3pE-40/42 to Aβ1-40/42 (Fig 2D). We then analyzed the detergent-insoluble/formic acid–soluble fractions of these mouse brains by mass spectrometry after the digestion of the samples by lysyl endopeptidase (Figs 3A and B and S5 and Table S3). We detected not only Aβ1-16 but also Aβ3pE-16 in the brains of Mme−/−APP-Tg mice (Fig 3B). Interestingly, this fraction contained trace quantities of Aβ2-16 and Aβ3-16, which are precursors of Aβ3pE-x. Next, we further analyzed amounts of Aβs present in the soluble fraction and accumulated in the insoluble fraction of the brains of APP-Tg mice using Western blot (WB) analysis (Figs 4A–C and S6) and ELISA (Fig 4D), which showed that changes in amounts of Aβ immunoreactive to the anti-Aβ antibodies basically showed similar patterns as that obtained using immunohistochemistry: Mme deficiency prominently increased the amounts of Aβ3pE-x from middle age, but a difference in the amount of Aβ1-x between the two genotypes was not observed with the progression of age. In contrast, the amount of Aβ3pE-x in both genotypes kept increasing until 24 mo of age (Fig 4B and C), resulting in an increased ratio of Aβ3pE-40/42 to Aβ1-40/42 (Fig 4D, rightmost graph). Notably, detectable amounts of Aβ3pE-40/42 were present both in the soluble and in the insoluble fractions (the order level of pmol/g), although they were considerably less than that of Aβ1-40/42. Colocalization of Aβ3pE-42 with cored plaques in the Mme−/−APP-Tg mouse brain was examined using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), which is known to selectively bind to cored plaques (Maeda et al, 2007; Ikonomovic et al, 2008)(Fig 5). Aβ3pE-42–positive signals corresponding to PiB-binding sites were detected preferentially in the core of amyloid plaques, whereas Aβ1-42–positive signals were observed in larger amyloid plaques (Fig 5A) and the PiB binding was increased in Mme−/−APP-Tg mice in a manner colocalizing with N3pE-positive cored plaques in a significant way (Fig 5B, left panel, and Fig 5C). PET analysis also showed an increase of in vivo binding of PiB in the Mme−/−APP-Tg mice in an age-dependent manner (Fig 5B, right panel, and Fig 5D). Furthermore, we found that Aβ3pE-40/42, but not Aβ1-40/42, colocalized well with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is known to be involved in Aβ aggregation (Nilsson et al, 2004), in the cores of amyloid plaques (Fig S7A). Intensities of ApoE-positive signals in the amyloid plaques and levels of ApoE and α1-antichymotrypsin in the soluble fraction were significantly elevated by the Mme deficiency in the 24-mo-old APP-Tg mice (Fig S7B and C). These observations consistently indicated that Mme deficiency increases the cored plaque–associated Aβ3pE-42. Generation and analysis of AppNL-(ΔDA)-F and AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F knock-in mouse lines We next aimed to reproduce Aβ3pE-42 pathology in mouse models, for which two knock-in mouse lines were generated: AppNL-(ΔDA)-F and AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F (Fig 6A). This strategy was based on our previous experimental results showing that primary neurons expressing APP cDNA with the first two amino acid residues of Aβ deleted (NL[ΔDA]E) produced Aβ3E-40/42 and that those in which E had been replaced by Q (NL[ΔDA]Q) produced Aβ3pE-40/42 (Shirotani et al, 2002). First, using the AppNL-F line of App KI mice we confirmed the effects of Mme deficiency as obtained with APP-Tg mice. Incidentally, Mme deficiency not only accelerated the deposition of both Aβ1-42 and Aβ3pE-42 in the AppNL-F line, but also increased the ratio of Aβ3pE-42 to Aβ1-42 (Fig 6B). When we analyzed new lines of App KI mice, we were indeed able to detect a trace amount (~1 fmol/g) of Aβ3pE-42 only in the brains of AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F mice at 2 mo of age (Fig S8). Despite our expectation, neither the AppNL-(ΔDA)-F nor the AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F lines exhibited any visible Aβ pathology at all, even after aging (i.e., 18 mo or more) (Fig 6C). Notably, biochemical quantification indicated that the AppNL-F line deposited more Aβ3pE-42 than the AppNL-(ΔDA)-F and AppNL-(ΔDA)-Q-F lines (Fig 6D), consistently indicating that Aβ3E-42 and Aβ3Q-42 are much more short-lived than Aβ1-42 after production in vivo. In any case, both histochemical and biochemical analyses of APP-Tg (Figs 2, 4, and 5) and AppNL-F line of App KI mice (Figs 6B and S9A) consistently indicated that deposition of Aβ3pE-42 takes place much later than that of Aβ1-42. The biochemical quantity of Aβ3pE-42 accounts for only 0.1% of total Aβ42 in the insoluble fraction of 24-mo-old AppNL-F mouse brains (Fig S9B and C). Changes in expression levels of exopeptidases and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferases involved in AβN3pE generation by Mme deficiency We assumed that a potential pathway where aminopeptidases and dipeptidyl peptidases may be involved (Fig S10) could compensate for physiological Aβ degradation decreased by Mme deficiency. Our findings show that aminopeptidase A (APN), aminopeptidase N (APN), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which were immunopurified from the membrane fraction of mouse brains, displayed Aβ-degrading activity (Fig 7A). Among them, DPP4 exhibited the highest activity. Protein contents were in the order of APN > APA > DPP4, but DPP4 had the highest specific activity (Fig 7C), suggesting that it plays a significant role in truncating amino-terminal amino acids (DA). Our results showed that the expression levels of APN, DPP4, and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like (QPCTL) were up-regulated by Mme deficiency, whereas the expression level of thyrotropin-releasing hormone–degrading enzyme, a pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase, was decreased (Fig 7D and E)."

Abstract
Background and Objectives
Previous studies have highlighted antidiabetic drugs as repurposing candidates for Alzheimer
disease (AD), but the disease-modifying eﬀects are still unclear.
Methods
A 2-sample mendelian randomization study design was applied to examine the association
between genetic variation in the targets of 4 antidiabetic drug classes and AD risk. Genetic
summary statistics for blood glucose were analyzed using UK Biobank data of 326,885 par-
ticipants, whereas summary statistics for AD were retrieved from previous genome-wide as-
sociation studies comprising 24,087 clinically diagnosed AD cases and 55,058 controls. Positive
control analysis on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and
obesity-related traits was conducted to validate the selection of instrumental variables.
Results
In the positive control analysis, genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with
higher insulin secretion, a lower risk of T2DM, and an increment in body mass index, waist
circumference, and hip circumference, consistent with drug mechanistic actions and previous
trial evidence. In the primary analysis, genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated
with a lower risk of AD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose,
95% CI 0.19– 0.72, p = 0.0034). These results for sulfonylureas were largely unchanged in the
sensitivity analysis using a genetic variant,rs757110, that has been validated to modulate the
target proteins of sulfonylureas (OR = 0.35 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI
0.15– 0.82, p = 0.016). An association between genetic variations in the glucagon-like peptide 1
(GLP-1) analogue target and a lower risk of AD was also observed (OR = 0.32 per 1 mmol/L
decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.13– 0.79, p = 0.014). However, this result should be
interpreted with caution because the positive control analyses for GLP-1 analogues did not
comply with a weight-loss eﬀect as shown in previous clinical trials. Results regarding other drug
classes were inconclusive.
Discussion
Genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with a lower risk of AD, and future
studies are warranted to clarify the underlying mechanistic pathways between sulfonylureas
and AD.

 Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease,
characterized by aberrant protein aggregation and neuronal
loss in the brain that leads to cognitive decline, memory loss,
and ultimately death.
1 However, currently, only a few agents
or drugs that can improve symptoms have been approved for
AD, whereas their neuroprotective eﬀects remain uncertain.2
Developing new drugs for AD is imperative but also extremely
challenging with more than 400 candidates recently failed in
phase III trials.3 Drug repurposing or repositioning, where
approved drugs are tested for a novel indication, has been
proposed as a more rapid and cost-e ﬀective strategy to
identify potential AD treatments because approved drugs
possess well-documented information for mechanism of ac-
tions and comprehensive safety proﬁles.
4
AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are 2 of the most
prevalent diseases in the aged population. A meta-analysis of
1,746,777 participants reported a 53% higher risk of de-
veloping AD in patients with T2DM.
5 Besides, AD has been
proposed as “type 3 diabetes” with insulin resistance and
impaired glucose control in the brain.6 Antidiabetic drugs,
based on their original intention of enhancing insulin signal-
ing and regulating glucose metabolism, have been highlighted
as repurposing candidates for AD.
7 Several randomized clin-
ical trials (RCTs) have been conducted in patients with early
or mild-to-moderate AD to investigate the disease-modifying
eﬀects of antidiabetic drugs, but the evidence to date was
inconclusive.
8 Given the long prodromal phase of AD, clinical
trials targeting early or mild-to-moderate AD have been
considered belated, whereas primary intervention in pre-
clinical AD or even earlier may oﬀer the best opportunity of
therapeutic success.
9 However, such primary prevention trials
are challenging because they require considerably large sam-
ple sizes and long-duration intervention.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical tool using
genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to make causal
inference between exposure(s) and outcome(s). Because
genetic variants are assigned randomly at conception and
before disease onset, MR is considered as a“natural” RCT,
which can minimize confounding and reverse causation.
10
Particularly for the genetic variants within the genes that
encode drug target proteins, such variants may inﬂuence the
expression of genes, modulate the function of encoded pro-
teins, and thereby closely proxy drug mechanism actions. In
the spirit of natural RCTs, MR studies leveraging such
druggable variants are useful in identifying drug repurposing
opportunities and predicting side eﬀects.
11 An MR study used
a variant on theHMGCR gene to proxy statin use and found
that genetically mimicked statin use was associated with a
higher risk of T2DM, consistent with the evidence from an
RCT of 129,170 participants.
12 Apart from controlling for
confounding and reverse causality, MR also provides the
possibility to emulate primary prevention trials that comprise
large sample sizes (recent genetic discoveries are usually based
on hundreds of thousands of participants) and long in-
tervention duration (genetically instrumented exposure oc-
curs before the outcome and is lifelong). Hence, we
conducted an MR study to examine the eﬀects of genetic
variation in antidiabetic drug targets on AD risk.
Methods
Study Design
The current study was conducted using a 2-sample MR design,
which extracted exposure and outcome data from 2 in-
dependent nonoverlapping populations. Genetic variants
within the genes that encode protein targets of antidiabetic
drugs (cis-variants) were identiﬁed in a genome-wide associa-
tion study (GWAS) summary dataset for blood glucose and
used as proxy for antidiabetic drug use. Lowering blood glucose
is an established physiologic response to antidiabetic drug
treatment, and hence, blood glucose is the biomarker of interest
in our study. To retain the validity of causal estimation, 3 MR
model assumptions are essential, which are (1) a robust asso-
ciation between IVs and target proteins (relevance), (2) in-
dependence of IVs on confounders (exchangeability), and (3)
no direct eﬀects of IVs on AD risk other than through the drug
targets (exclusion restriction). A framework of our study design
is presented in eFigure 1, links.lww.com/WNL/C91.
Blood Glucose GWAS Data
IV-exposure associations were extracted from a GWAS of
blood glucose analyzed on participants of European ancestry
from UK Biobank (UKB).
13 Individuals with a diagnosis of
diabetes in the inpatient registry (deﬁned as E10-14 inICD-10
and 2500-2529 in ICD-9) or with self-reported diabetes in
questionnaires were excluded from the analysis. In the associ-
ation testing, a mixed linear model– based method was used to
control for population stratiﬁcation by principle components
and relatedness by a genetic relationship matrix.14 Finally,
326,885 participants were analyzed. Details about the GWAS
are provided in eAppendix 1, links.lww.com/WNL/C91.

 AD GWAS Data
The AD summary statistics (IV-outcome associations) were
extracted from a previously conducted GWAS.
15 In phase 1, the
data from Alzheimer’s disease working group of the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium, the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s
Project, and the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project were
meta-analyzed, totaling 24,087 clinically diagnosed late-onset AD
cases and 55,058 controls. In phase 3, 47,793 AD-by-proxy cases
and 328,320 controls from UKB were additionally meta-analyzed
on top of the phase 1 stage, resulting in 71,880 AD/AD-by-proxy
cases and 383,378 controls. We used the dataset that only contains
clinically diagnosed AD cases in primary analysis and the dataset
that contains AD/AD-by-proxy cases in sensitivity analysis.
Instrument Selection
Seven major classes of antidiabetic drugs were initially identiﬁed,
including metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor,
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, insulin/
insulin analogues, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues,
sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones (TZD).
16 Information re-
garding the pharmacologically active protein targets and corre-
sponding encoding genes was retrieved from the DrugBank and
the ChEMBL databases separately (Table 1).17,18 Because the
protein targets of metformin diﬀered in the 2 databases and the
molecules underlying metformin’s physiologic eﬀects remain
largely unknown,19 metformin was excluded from further analysis.
Next, we identiﬁed thecis-variants within each encoding gene
(±2,500 base pairs of the gene location) and retained the
variants associated with blood glucose at a false discovery rate
of <0.05. None of the variants for SGLT2 inhibitors survived
the selection, hence being excluded from further analysis.
Palindromic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs [formerly
SNPs]; SNVs with the same pair of purine pyrimidine bases
on forward and reverse strands) were excluded to avoid am-
biguity in the identiﬁcation of eﬀect alleles. The 2 variants for
DPP4 inhibitors are both palindromic (no high-LD proxies
were found), so the drug was excluded from further analysis.
The variants that remained for each drug class were then
clumped with a R
2 of 0.01 and a window size of 500 kB,
complemented with a sensitivity analysis clumping with R2
from 0.01 to 0.50 to gain greater precision by including a
larger number of partially independent variants. 11 The
process of instrument selection is displayed in Figure 1. In

ditional variant, rs757110 , for sulfonylureas, which has
been validated as a strong proxy in in vitro and population
studies. 20,21
Positive Control Analysis
To validate our selection of IVs, positive control analysis was
performed with T2DM, insulin secretion, insulin resistance,
and obesity-related traits as outcomes. T2DM is the original
indication of antidiabetic drugs, whereas sulfonylureas and
GLP-1 analogues promote insulin secretion and TZD in-
creases insulin sensitivity.
16 IVs for insulin/insulin analogues
were selected withinINSR that encodes the insulin receptor,
so it would be expected to alter the function of the insulin

 receptor and reduce insulin resistance. Obesity is another
phenotype inﬂuenced by antidiabetic drugs. A meta-analysis
of clinical trials suggests that insulin analogues, sulfonylureas,
and TZD contribute to weight gain, and GLP-1 analogues
cause weight loss.
22 Hence, 3 obesity-related traits, including
body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and hip
circumference (HIP), were used as outcomes.
Because the GWAS datasets for insulin secretion, insulin re-
sistance, WC, and HIP (outcome datasets) contain less SNVs
than the UKB blood glucose GWAS (exposure dataset), we
retained nonpalindromic SNVs available in both datasets and
performed clumping to obtain IVs for the positive control anal-
yses (R
2 < 0.01). Genetically predicted drug eﬀects that showed
directional consistency with clinical trial evidence/drug mecha-
nisms were considered to pass the positive control analysis.
In addition to the positive control analyses, we also explored
the association between genetic variation in antidiabetic drug
targets and cardiovascular diseases/hippocampal volume de-
spite rather inconclusive evidence given by previous clinical
trials.

rized in eTable 1, links.lww.com/WNL/C91.29-33 Characteristics

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations,
and Patient Consents
Our analysis of UKB data has been conducted under appli-
cation number“22224.” The summary statistics for AD, BMI,
and T2DM do not contain any personal information, and the
GWAS have obtained ethical approval from relevant ethics
review boards.
Statistical Analysis
First, the IV-exposure association from the blood glucose
GWAS dataset and the IV-outcome association from the
outcome GWAS dataset were merged. The causal association
was estimated with the Wald ratio test for 1 single IV and with
the random-eﬀects inverse variance– weighted (IVW) method
for multiple IVs.
10 The IVW method provides unbiased causal
estimation when all IVs are valid or if overall pleiotropy is
balanced to be zero.
10 The Cochran’s Q test was performed to
test heterogeneity within IVs and to detect any types of
pleiotropy, balanced or unbalanced ( p for heterogeneity
<0.05).10 To deal with unbalanced pleiotropy, the MR-Egger
regression was applied. MR-Egger provides reliable causal
estimation even if all IVs are invalid and indicates the presence

the IVs was tested by F statistics and indicates weak instru-
ments when F statistics <11. All analyses were conducted using
the “TwoSampleMR” package in R software version 3.6.0.34 To
resemble the lowering eﬀects of blood glucose by antidiabetic
drugs, all estimations were scaled to per 1 mmol/L decrement
in blood glucose. A Bonferroni-corrected signiﬁcance level ofp
value < 0.012 (0.05/4) was used to adjust for multiple testing of
5 drug classes. For the genetically instrumented drug class
conﬁrmed to be associated with AD, we further investigated the
colocalization between blood glucose and AD within the target
gene region using the“coloc” package.35

tion, insulin resistance, BMI, WC, and HIP are publicly avail-

Results
Positive Control Analyses
As shown in Figure 2, panel A, genetic variation in the targets of
TZD, sulfonylureas, insulin analogues, and GLP-1 analogues
was associated with a decreased risk of T2DM. When looking
into insulin secretion and insulin resistance (Figure 2, panels B
and C), genetic variation in the targets of sulfonylureas and
GLP-1 analogues was associated with increased insulin secre-
tion, whereas insulin/insulin analogues and TZD were associ-
ated with decreased insulin resistance, consistent with the drug
mechanism of actions. For obesity-related traits (Figure 2,
panels D– F), the estimates for TZD and sulfonylureas sug-
gested increment in BMI, WC, and HIP, consistent with evi-
dence from the meta-analysis of clinical trials. However, the
estimates for insulin/insulin analogues and GLP-1 analogues
were varying across the 3 obesity-related traits.
Effects of Genetic Variation in Antidiabetic
Drug Targets on AD Risk
The results from our primary analysis using a GWAS dataset
that contains 24,087 clinically diagnosed late-onset AD cases
are shown in Figure 3. Generally, genetic variation in sulfo-
nylurea targets was associated with a reduced risk of AD at the
Bonferroni-corrected threshold (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38 per 1
mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.19– 0.72, p =
0.0034). The association was consistent in the analysis using
the validated proxy,rs757110 (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.15– 0.82,
p = 0.016). Meanwhile, the estimates for sulfonylureas in the
weighted median method (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.17– 0.84) and
MR-Egger regression (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.05– 3.79) also
conﬁrmed a reduced risk of AD, although with a wider CI as
the MR-Egger regression produces larger standard errors than
the conventional IVW method (eTable 4, links.lww.com/
WNL/C91). Besides, a suggestive association between ge-
netic variation in the GLP-1 analogue target and lower risk of
AD was observed across diﬀerent MR methods (Figure 3 and
eTable 4, links.lww.com/WNL/C91, IVW: OR = 0.32, 95%
CI 0.13– 0.79, p = 0.014; weighted median: OR = 0.34, 95% CI
0.11– 1.07, p = 0.066; MR-Egger: OR = 0.35, 95% CI
0.05– 2.52, p = 0.49). For all the estimates, no heterogeneity
within IVs or substantial pleiotropy was detected (Figure 3,
p for heterogeneity >0.05,p for pleiotropy >0.05).
In the sensitivity analysis using a GWAS dataset comprising
71,880 AD/AD-by-proxy cases (eFigure 2, links.lww.com/
WNL/C91), genetic variation in the targets of sulfonylureas
and GLP-1 analogues showed protective eﬀects (sulfonyl-
ureas: OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.58– 1.05; GLP-1 analogues: OR =
0.53, 95% CI 0.37– 0.77), although the eﬀect sizes attenuated
toward the null possibly because of the dilution eﬀects by AD-
by-proxy cases. Considering the possible uncertainty arising
from instrumenting each drug class with a relatively small
number of IVs, we conducted a sensitivity analysis retaining
more partially independent IVs by clumping the variants with
relaxing R
2. The estimates for sulfonylureas and GLP-1 ana-
logues stabilized throughout the R2 ranging from 0.001 to
0.50; meanwhile, the standard error decreased with more IVs
being included. However, the estimates insulin analogue and
TZD varied across di ﬀerent R
2 and included the null
(Figure 4).
Colocalization Analysis for Sulfonylureas and
GLP-1 Analogues
Colocalization analysis was performed for sulfonylureas and
GLP-1 analogues within the drug target encoding genes
(±2,500 base pairs ofKCNJ11 and ABCC8 for sulfonylureas
and ofGLP1R for GLP-1 analogues). The results are shown in
eTable 5, links.lww.com/WNL/C91. Generally, we did not
observe strong evidence suggesting colocalization between
blood glucose and AD within the 2 gene regions for sulfonyl-
ureas (probability for sharing 1 common causal variant: 2.5% in
KCNJ11 and 3.9% inABCC8); however, when looking into the
regional association plots (eFigure 3, links.lww.com/WNL/
C91), a trend of colocalization was noted. For GLP-1 ana-
logues, we did notﬁnd any evidence of either sharing a com-
mon variant or a distinct trend of colocalization withinGLP1R
(eTable 5 and eFigure 4, links.lww.com/WNL/C91). For
more details regarding the colocalization analyses and results,
please see eAppendix 3, links.lww.com/WNL/C91.
Discussion
We investigated the eﬀects of genetic variation in antidiabetic
drug targets on AD risk using a combination of genetic
datasets for blood glucose (;300,000 participants) and AD
(24,087 AD cases and 55,058 controls). We found evidence to
support that genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was as-
sociated with a lower risk of AD.
A handful of observational studies have investigated the re-
lationship of sulfonylureas with AD, but the results are rather

 inconclusive.36-39 In a prospective study following 127,209
dementia-free individuals for 7 years, a marginal protective eﬀect
was observed in diabetic patients (s u l f o n y l u r e a sv sn o tt a k i n ga n y
antidiabetic drugs: HR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.71– 1.01).38 Conversely,
in a case-control study of 7,086 AD cases, sulfonylureas were not
associated with the development of AD (users vs nonusers: OR =
1.01, 95% CI 0.72– 1.42).
37 The present MR study diﬀers from
these observational studies in 3 key aspects. First, the observa-
tional studies were conducted in diabetic patients and hence were
unable to separate the true drug eﬀect from that of diabetes,
i.e., confounding by indication. Meanwhile, the present MR study
investigated the genetically predicted drug eﬀects in a nondiabetic
general population. Second, the observational studies measured
drug use at baseline, but the existence of poor monotherapy
adherence may cause contamination. A study on veterans showed
that around 40% of diabetic patients who initiated sulfonylureas
added or switched to metformin afterward.
39 Drug adherence is
less of a concern in our MR models because the genetically
instrumented exposure is lifelong. Finally, unmeasured con-
founding could also be an issue in observational studies. Although
the observational studies have controlled for confounders avail-
able in their datasets, these are diﬃcult to measure, or even
unknown, and may linger and induce bias. Conversely, taking
advantage of the random allocation of genetic variants at con-
ception, MR is expected to be less aﬀected by confounding.
10
Sulfonylureas lower blood glucose by blocking the KATP
channel on the membrane of pancreatic beta cells. Physio-
logically, the pancreatic KATP channel closes as a response to
blood glucose increase, subsequently producing a membrane
depolarization and stimulating insulin secretion.20 Therefore,
sulfonylurea use might relate to AD partly through its regu-
latory eﬀects on glucose metabolism. Evidence from a pre-
vious MR study showed that increased fasting blood glucose
(OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.04– 1.68) andβ-cell dysfunction (OR =
1.92, 95% CI 1.15– 3.21) contributed to a higher risk of AD.
40
Particularly, AD has been proposed as a brain-speciﬁc form of
diabetes, a“type 3 diabetes.”6 A study by An et al.41 found that
abnormalities in brain glucose homeostasis, characterized by
higher brain blood glucose levels, reduced glycolyticﬂux, and
lower neuronal glucose transporter 3 levels, were intrinsic to AD
pathogenesis. Moreover, periphery glucose regulation might af-
fect the glucose homeostasis in the CNS. The same study showed
that longitudinal increases in fasting plasma glucose levels were
associated with higher brain tissue glucose concentrations.
41
The KATP channel is also abundantly expressed in the brain.42
Although the exact role of KATP channels in the brain is largely
unknown, it has been found to modulate neurotransmitter
release and to mediate the action of memantine in the mouse
hippocampus.
42-44 Besides, the brain KATP channel has been
evident to aﬀect CNS function by clinical investigations. A
study compared neuropsychological features between adults
with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) caused
by KCNJ11 variations and byINS variations (the gene en-
codes insulin; its variations inﬂuence insulin synthesis). Pa-
tients with KCNJ11 variations were more likely to have
abnormal CNS features, such as learning diﬃculties, reduced
IQ, and motor deﬁcits, whereas patients withINS variations
rarely showed neurologic abnormalities. 45 Furthermore,
Clark et al.46 have conﬁrmed that such neurologic abnormities
originate from the CNS. Analogous to the genetic variations
in patients with PNDM, our IVs selected within theKCNJ11
and ABCC8 genes may simultaneously capture the modula-
tion of the KATP channel in the brain and pancreas. This
synthesis would incorporate the downstream eﬀects, either
through neurologic alterations or blood glucose regulation, in
our MR models. Given the poor penetration of the sulfonyl-
urea across the blood-brain barrier,
47 caution is warranted in
repurposing the existing sulfonylurea agents for AD, especially
until the elucidation of the underlying mechanistic pathways,
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.
A suggestive association between genetic variation in GLP-1
analogue targets and lower risk of AD was also observed in our
study. GLP-1 lowers blood glucose by binding to GLP-1

load, although the study was underpowered to detect such
changes.50 Besides, 2 ongoing RCTs (phase 2 and phase 3) are
planning to recruit patients with early AD to examine the eﬀects of
GLP-1 analogues (liraglutide and semaglutide, respectively) on
cerebral glucose metabolism, cognitive performance, and patho-
logic biomarkers (ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT01843075
and NCT04777396), which is expected to provide more con-
vincing evidence to this topic.
The present MR study has several strengths. First, the par-
ticipants were restricted to people of European ancestry,
which minimized the possible bias arising from population
stratiﬁcation. Second, the IVs were selected from thecis-var-
iants within the coding genes for drug targets (±2.5 kB),
which controlled the likelihood of pleiotropy by IVs tagging
other genes. Also, no heterogeneity within the IVs was detected
in our MR analysis, further substantiating the absence of plei-
otropy that would bias our estimations. Third, we conducted a
set of positive control analyses to validate the strength of our
IVs. The results for sulfonylureas, instrumented either by the 4
clumped IVs or by the validated proxyrs757110, were in line
with the evidence from prior meta-analyses of clinical trials.
This strongly supported these IVs as appropriate proxies. Then,
a reduced risk in AD was observed, consistent in these 2 sets of
IVs, which further lends support for a putative causal re-
lationship between sulfonylureas and AD.
The study has several limitations. First, our study can only
predict the on-target eﬀects of antidiabetic drugs because only
the well-documented protein targets were included in our
analysis. Drug eﬀects that are not exerted through these

 protein targets (oﬀ-target eﬀects) cannot be captured in our
MR models. Second, the genetically predicted drug eﬀects
may be somewhat diﬀerent from therapeutic practice. An
exposure instrumented by genetic variants is present from
birth and lasts for a lifetime. Our analyses may therefore be
interpreted as assessing long-term modulation eﬀects of drug
target proteins. Moreover, given that genetic eﬀects are life-
long, our estimates cannot reﬂect the eﬀects of exposure to
antidiabetic drugs during a certain period of life. Third, met-
formin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and DPP4 inhibitors were ex-
cluded from the analysis because of yet unclear mechanism of
actions or lack of proper IVs. Also, our results regarding
insulin/insulin analogues, TZD, and GLP-1 analogues are
inconclusive, likely because of the uncertainty by the small
number of IVs. Future studies are warranted to reexamine
these drug classes when more or stronger IVs are available.
Besides, because we only used the genetic summary data re-
stricted to the population of European ancestry, the gener-
alizability of our results would be conﬁned in European
ancestral populations. Finally, we did notﬁnd strong coloc-
alization evidence for blood glucose and AD withinKCNJ11
and ABCC8 for sulfonylureas, which might be due to weak
variant-AD association in the region. Therefore, ourﬁndings
regarding sulfonylureas warranted further examinations when
a larger AD GWAS is available.
In conclusion, this study provides supportive evidence for
genetic variation of sulfonylurea targets, through the modu-
lation of the K
ATP channel, which was associated with a lower
risk of AD. Future studies should be conducted to clarify the
underlying mechanistic pathways between sulfonylureas and
AD. The study also exempliﬁes how the MR design may be a
promising tool forﬁnding new indications for approved drugs.
The method allows testing interventions that are otherwise
costly, time-consuming, or, in other ways, impractical and
should be considered a screening instrument in the drug de-
velopment phase.

 ","The article discusses the relationship between type 2 diabetes, antidiabetic medications, and Alzheimer's disease. It reviews studies indicating a potential protective effect of metformin and sulfonylureas against dementia. Genetic associations linking glucose metabolism with Alzheimer's are explored through Mendelian randomization. The role of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in both type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's is highlighted, suggesting that modulation of these channels could be a therapeutic target. Additionally, the article mentions evidence for brain glucose dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease and discusses the mechanisms underlying cognitive features observed in individuals with KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes.","Background and Objectives Previous studies have highlighted antidiabetic drugs as repurposing candidates for Alzheimer disease (AD), but the disease-modifying effects are still unclear. Methods A 2-sample mendelian randomization study design was applied to examine the association between genetic variation in the targets of 4 antidiabetic drug classes and AD risk. Genetic summary statistics for blood glucose were analyzed using UK Biobank data of 326,885 participants, whereas summary statistics for AD were retrieved from previous genome-wide association studies comprising 24,087 clinically diagnosed AD cases and 55,058 controls. Positive control analysis on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and obesity-related traits was conducted to validate the selection of instrumental variables. Results In the positive control analysis, genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with higher insulin secretion, a lower risk of T2DM, and an increment in body mass index, waist circumference, and hip circumference, consistent with drug mechanistic actions and previous trial evidence. In the primary analysis, genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with a lower risk of AD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.19– 0.72, p = 0.0034). These results for sulfonylureas were largely unchanged in the sensitivity analysis using a genetic variant,rs757110, that has been validated to modulate the target proteins of sulfonylureas (OR = 0.35 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.15– 0.82, p = 0.016). An association between genetic variations in the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue target and a lower risk of AD was also observed (OR = 0.32 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.13– 0.79, p = 0.014). However, this result should be interpreted with caution because the positive control analyses for GLP-1 analogues did not comply with a weight-loss effect as shown in previous clinical trials. Results regarding other drug classes were inconclusive. Discussion Genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with a lower risk of AD, and future studies are warranted to clarify the underlying mechanistic pathways between sulfonylureas and AD.","Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, characterized by aberrant protein aggregation and neuronal loss in the brain that leads to cognitive decline, memory loss, and ultimately death. However, currently, only a few agents or drugs that can improve symptoms have been approved for AD, whereas their neuroprotective effects remain uncertain. Developing new drugs for AD is imperative but also extremely challenging with more than 400 candidates recently failed in phase III trials. Drug repurposing or repositioning, where approved drugs are tested for a novel indication, has been proposed as a more rapid and cost-effective strategy to identify potential AD treatments because approved drugs possess well-documented information for mechanism of actions and comprehensive safety profiles. AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are 2 of the most prevalent diseases in the aged population. A meta-analysis of 1,746,777 participants reported a 53% higher risk of developing AD in patients with T2DM. Besides, AD has been proposed as “type 3 diabetes” with insulin resistance and impaired glucose control in the brain. Antidiabetic drugs, based on their original intention of enhancing insulin signaling and regulating glucose metabolism, have been highlighted as repurposing candidates for AD. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted in patients with early or mild-to-moderate AD to investigate the disease-modifying effects of antidiabetic drugs, but the evidence to date was inconclusive. Given the long prodromal phase of AD, clinical trials targeting early or mild-to-moderate AD have been considered belated, whereas primary intervention in preclinical AD or even earlier may offer the best opportunity of therapeutic success. However, such primary prevention trials are challenging because they require considerably large sample sizes and long-duration intervention. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical tool using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to make causal inference between exposure(s) and outcome(s). Because genetic variants are assigned randomly at conception and before disease onset, MR is considered as a“natural” RCT, which can minimize confounding and reverse causation. Particularly for the genetic variants within the genes that encode drug target proteins, such variants may influence the expression of genes, modulate the function of encoded proteins, and thereby closely proxy drug mechanism actions. In the spirit of natural RCTs, MR studies leveraging such druggable variants are useful in identifying drug repurposing opportunities and predicting side effects. An MR study used a variant on the HMGCR gene to proxy statin use and found that genetically mimicked statin use was associated with a higher risk of T2DM, consistent with the evidence from an RCT of 129,170 participants. Apart from controlling for confounding and reverse causality, MR also provides the possibility to emulate primary prevention trials that comprise large sample sizes (recent genetic discoveries are usually based on hundreds of thousands of participants) and long intervention duration (genetically instrumented exposure occurs before the outcome and is lifelong). Hence, we conducted an MR study to examine the effects of genetic variation in antidiabetic drug targets on AD risk.","Positive Control Analyses As shown in Figure 2, panel A, genetic variation in the targets of TZD, sulfonylureas, insulin analogues, and GLP-1 analogues was associated with a decreased risk of T2DM. When looking into insulin secretion and insulin resistance (Figure 2, panels B and C), genetic variation in the targets of sulfonylureas and GLP-1 analogues was associated with increased insulin secretion, whereas insulin/insulin analogues and TZD were associated with decreased insulin resistance, consistent with the drug mechanism of actions. For obesity-related traits (Figure 2, panels D– F), the estimates for TZD and sulfonylureas suggested increment in BMI, WC, and HIP, consistent with evidence from the meta-analysis of clinical trials. However, the estimates for insulin/insulin analogues and GLP-1 analogues were varying across the 3 obesity-related traits. Effects of Genetic Variation in Antidiabetic Drug Targets on AD Risk The results from our primary analysis using a GWAS dataset that contains 24,087 clinically diagnosed late-onset AD cases are shown in Figure 3. Generally, genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with a reduced risk of AD at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.19– 0.72, p = 0.0034). The association was consistent in the analysis using the validated proxy,rs757110 (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.15– 0.82, p = 0.016). Meanwhile, the estimates for sulfonylureas in the weighted median method (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.17– 0.84) and MR-Egger regression (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.05– 3.79) also confirmed a reduced risk of AD, although with a wider CI as the MR-Egger regression produces larger standard errors than the conventional IVW method (eTable 4, links.lww.com/WNL/C91). Besides, a suggestive association between genetic variation in the GLP-1 analogue target and lower risk of AD was observed across different MR methods (Figure 3 and eTable 4, links.lww.com/WNL/C91, IVW: OR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.13– 0.79, p = 0.014; weighted median: OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.11– 1.07, p = 0.066; MR-Egger: OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.05– 2.52, p = 0.49). For all the estimates, no heterogeneity within IVs or substantial pleiotropy was detected (Figure 3, p for heterogeneity >0.05,p for pleiotropy >0.05). In the sensitivity analysis using a GWAS dataset comprising 71,880 AD/AD-by-proxy cases (eFigure 2, links.lww.com/WNL/C91), genetic variation in the targets of sulfonylureas and GLP-1 analogues showed protective effects (sulfonylureas: OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.58– 1.05; GLP-1 analogues: OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.37– 0.77), although the effect sizes attenuated toward the null possibly because of the dilution effects by AD-by-proxy cases. Considering the possible uncertainty arising from instrumenting each drug class with a relatively small number of IVs, we conducted a sensitivity analysis retaining more partially independent IVs by clumping the variants with relaxing R2. The estimates for sulfonylureas and GLP-1 analogues stabilized throughout the R2 ranging from 0.001 to 0.50; meanwhile, the standard error decreased with more IVs being included. However, the estimates insulin analogue and TZD varied across different R2 and included the null (Figure 4). Colocalization Analysis for Sulfonylureas and GLP-1 Analogues Colocalization analysis was performed for sulfonylureas and GLP-1 analogues within the drug target encoding genes (±2,500 base pairs ofKCNJ11 and ABCC8 for sulfonylureas and ofGLP1R for GLP-1 analogues). The results are shown in eTable 5, links.lww.com/WNL/C91. Generally, we did not observe strong evidence suggesting colocalization between blood glucose and AD within the 2 gene regions for sulfonylureas (probability for sharing 1 common causal variant: 2.5% in KCNJ11 and 3.9% inABCC8); however, when looking into the regional association plots (eFigure 3, links.lww.com/WNL/C91), a trend of colocalization was noted. For GLP-1 analogues, we did not find any evidence of either sharing a common variant or a distinct trend of colocalization withinGLP1R (eTable 5 and eFigure 4, links.lww.com/WNL/C91).

SUMMARY
The high number of failed pre-clinical and clinical studies for compounds targeting Alzheimer disease (AD)
has demonstrated that there is a need to reassess existing strategies. Here, we pursue a holistic, mecha-
nism-centric drug repurposing approach combining computational analytics and experimental screening
data. Based on this integrative workﬂow, we identiﬁed 77 druggable modiﬁers of tau phosphorylation
(pTau). One of the upstream modulators of pTau, HDAC6, was screened with 5,632 drugs in a tau-speciﬁc
assay, resulting in the identiﬁcation of 20 repurposing candidates. Four compounds and their known targets
were found to have a link to AD-speciﬁc genes. Our approach can be applied to a variety of AD-associated
pathophysiological mechanisms to identify more repurposing candidates.
INTRODUCTION
Aging societies face a rapidly growing number of people
suffering from AD, resulting in an enormous socioeconomic
burden.1 Billions of dollars are invested to address this problem,
but despite all efforts to ﬁnd effective therapeutics, treatment op-
tions are sparse and have largely failed to achieve satisfying
results in the ﬁght against AD. More than 100 candidate com-
pounds were abandoned in development or showed disap-
pointing results in clinical trials (CTs), leaving only a limited
number of remedies that are currently approved and used for
symptomatic treatment of AD.
2
THE BIGGER PICTURE Owing to current setbacks in the discovery and development of novel treatments
tackling Alzheimer disease (AD), a re-evaluation of research and development (R&D) strategies is underway.
Here, we present a holistic pharmacological approach that combines drug-target information with knowl-
edge graphs that represent essential pathophysiology mechanisms. The resulting Human Brain Pharma-
come (HBP) embeds hundreds of relevant drug-target interactions in the context of disease mechanisms
governing AD. We demonstrate how such a tool can be used to aid AD research by identifying already-
approved drugs that have the potential to treat the disease, thereby bypassing the expensive and time-
consuming task of researching and developing a new drug. In our study, we identiﬁed new drug-target com-
binations and provided mechanistic explanations that help to improve our understanding of AD pathology
and support future development of effective therapeutic strategies.

OPEN ACCESS Why do CTs in AD treatment continue to fail? An incomplete
understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, erroneous
selection of target and drug candidates, shortcomings of pre-
clinical animal models, wrong drug dosage regimens, and false
recruiting of best responders are some of the reasons why these
clinical studies have so far failed.
3,4 Novel therapeutic avenues
must be established, and achieving this requires a re-evaluation
of the strategies currently used.
Drug repurposing, the process of identifying new therapeutic
uses for existing drugs, has grown in popularity in recent years
and has been shown to be quite successful.
5,6 This strategy,
also referred to as drug repositioning, offers an enormous advan-
tage: substances that have already been well examined and
approved with a wide spectrum of data, including safety and ef-
ﬁciency proﬁles, can be critically evaluated in a new disease
context. Drug repurposing maximizes the therapeutic applica-
tion of drugs while minimizing the risk of failure, leading to a
reduced period of time by which they are ready for the market
with a new indication context.
7
Repositioning of drugs can be driven by structuralin silicoan-
alyses (e.g., molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, vir-
tual screening, or cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) or X-ray
structural determination)
8 or by the experimental domain
(in vitro biochemical and cellular assays, high-throughput
screening, in vivo animal tests),9,10 or approached through a
combination of both ﬁelds.11 Generally, drug repurposing strate-
gies are drug, target, or disease centric depending on the
research focus or pharmaceutical interest.
12 In a drug-centric
approach, a drug is connected to a formerly unknown target
(off-target) and its target-associated indications, whereas in a
target-centric approach, the drug-target relationship is known
(on-target) and linked to a new therapeutic context.
New avenues of drug repurposing are being explored, including
signature-based approaches that focus on evidence-driven iden-
tiﬁcation of new repurposing compounds,
13 which is in line with
our mechanism-oriented strategy. In the repurposing approach
described here, we are not restricted to a single approach, there-
fore allowing greater ﬂexibility in terms of repositioning candidate
identiﬁcation. We combined knowledge mined from a variety of
sources with focused experimental screening data of selected
drug candidates into our drug-target-mechanism-oriented data
model, the Human Brain Pharmacome (HBP). Information retrieval
and extraction were applied in a reciprocal manner for the enrich-
ment of targets, ligands, chemical similarity, or assays in the HBP.
The enrichment of our computational model was complemented
by information extracted from the patent literature as well as quan-
titative information extracted from tables in published articles.
Dedicated mining strategies enabled us to use this information
for drug/target prospective and retrospective validation as well
as for assay reﬁnement. The dynamic nature of literature and the
continuous research efforts in AD prompted us to develop and
implement processes for progressive updates of the knowledge
graph with several internal checks to ensure that novel and even
controversial ﬁndings were added back to the HBP with full prov-
enance of the information source.
Here, we demonstrate our approach in an AD-biomarker-
centric search strategy. The HBP model includes a highly granular
representation of mechanistic underpinnings of tauopathies, a
class of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the depo-
sition of abnormal microtubule-associated tau protein (MAPT) in
the brain in the form of neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs).
14,15 Phos-
phorylation of MAPT (pTau), and thus creation of insoluble aggre-
gates, is considered one of the key regulatory factors that drives
AD pathology, and its abundance is used as a predictive
biomarker of AD.
16 Based on our work in the pTau context, we
implemented a generalizable workﬂow (Figure 1; Video S1)f o r
the identiﬁcation of new druggable targets in relation to AD-spe-
ciﬁc pathophysiology processes. In ourin silico-driven knowledge
mining approach, we focused on mechanisms related to post-
translational modiﬁcations. Starting with pTau as the root node
(primary target, seemethods), we sought to answer the following
questions in the context of this AD pathological hallmark:
1) Are there druggable targets (secondary targets, see
methods) that modulate pTau?
2) Which of the targets identiﬁed in (1) are putative repurpos-
ing targets based on qualitative and quantitative data
analysis?
3) Which repurposing compounds are highly active in our
pTau-focused experimental setting?
4) Can we validate unknown drug-target pairs in the context
of AD therapeutics?
RESULTS
The HBP
We created a drug- and mechanism-oriented model, the HBP,
that covers a broad spectrum of biological processes relevant in
the pathophysiological context of AD (Figures 2A and 2B). By aug-
menting it with metadata, quantitative data, and contextual infor-
mation, we have created a comprehensive framework forin silico
identiﬁcation of druggable mechanisms and a broad information
base for evaluating potential therapeutic targets and agents.
Identiﬁcation of druggable modulators of pTau
Using our secondary target selection pipeline (seemethods), we
identiﬁed 77 druggable targets (cited in 155 documents) that also
have an upstream causal interaction with pTau (Figures 2Aa n d
2C; Data S1). Our initial list contained proteins from several
different gene families: MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, MAPK9,
MAPK10, MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13, and MAPK14 (mitogen-
activated protein kinases); PPP1CA, PPP2CA, PPP2CB, PPP3CA,
and PPP5C (protein phosphatase catalytic subunits); PPP2R1A
and PPP2R2A (protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunits);
S100A1 and S100B (S100 calcium binding proteins); CDK1,
CDK2, CDK5, and CDK5R1 (cyclin dependent kinases); CAMK2A
and CAMK2B (calmodulin dependent protein kinases); and ABL1
and ABL2 (Abl family tyrosine kinases). Cross-validation of
protein-protein-interaction data from several resources (IntAct,
BioGRID, Pathway Commons, STRING,https://bikmi.pharmacome.
scaiview.com/) conﬁrmed 54 of these targets as direct interactors of
pTau (Data S2).
Qualitative and quantitative data analysis reveal
putative repurposing targets
One of our primary goals was to ﬁnd new or repurposed com-
pounds for treating pTau in the context of AD. To this end, we
ll
OPEN ACCESS Article
2 Patterns 3, 100433, March 11, 2022 performed a statistical analysis of the secondary target metadata
to identify the best candidate for additional screening (Data S1).
First, we determined the number of BioAssays available for
each secondary target to evaluate which of our candidate proteins
had the most screening data available. These calculations are
indicative of the number of known drug-target interactions as
conﬁrmed by several independent studies and serve as better
values to evaluate protein/compound associations as opposed
to looking purely at drugs that are approved and on the market.
Our search resulted in a list of the top ﬁve ranked proteins:
HDAC6, ABL1, CDK2, MAPK14, and SRC with 1,938, 1,929,
1,518, 1,490, and 1,363 BioAssay mentions, respectively. We
then calculated the ratio of these counts to the number of available
drugs for each protein, thereby determining which candidates had
the greatest opportunity for drug repurposing exploration. Based
on the information mined from DrugBank, HDAC6 had the highest
BioAssay-to-known-drug ratio of the top ﬁve candidates with
1,938 available assays at the time of writing and only six approved
drugs on the market, thus making it a prime candidate for testing
potential new therapeutic compounds. Additionally, among the
top ﬁve ranked proteins, HDAC6 had the fewest mentions within
the parsed corpus of patents. Furthermore, research into the cur-
rent clinical trial landscape revealed that there is only one trial in
the recruiting phase in context of both AD and an approved
HDAC6 selective compound (NCT03056495;Data S1). Therefore,
assay availability, the lack of market-available or patented drugs,
and the sparse clinical focus strongly argue in favor of HDAC6 as a
suitable target candidate to demonstrate our repurposing selec-
tion workﬂow.
Secondary-target candidate selection: HDAC6
Research into HDAC6 revealed that it was previously the focus of
cancer research
20 owing to its role in chromatin remodeling, cell
motility, and gene regulation.21 However, HDAC6 activity has
also been shown to inﬂuence the structure of microtubules,
thus making it an enticing candidate in the context of neurode-
generative diseases.22,23 Interestingly, the HBP revealed a new
potential intervention pathway: HDAC6 was shown to have a
direct inﬂuence on acetylation of pTau.19 According to Carlo-
magno et al., HDAC6 mediated deacetylation of tau at certain
sites (such as K321;Figure 3A), which also allow for phosphory-
lation of the tau protein (pTau).
24 One such study reported that
HDAC6 activity at K280 and K281 positively correlated with the
pTau protein abundance,
25 while another group demonstrated
that a direct acetylation of MAPT was shown to favor the gener-
ation of pathological pTau aggregates.26 The study mentioned
ﬁrst suggests that the inhibition of HDAC6 and thereby the acet-
ylation of K280 and K281, should lead to a decrease in harmful
pTau aggregation by indirectly preventing phosphorylation
from taking place at key residues. We have adapted this informa-
tion in our hypothesis (Figure 2C). Though the dynamics of the
post-translational modiﬁcations of MAPT, their mutual inﬂuence,
and the downstream effects on the formation of pathological tau
tangles are not fully understood, especially in a human context,
HDAC6 does appear to have a central role in which disease-rele-
vant signal cascades in AD are integrated.
Experimental validation of HDAC6 and candidate
compounds
As classical HDAC6 assays often use consensus sequences
derived from histone substrates, we sought to use a more speciﬁc
readout for our experimental validation step. We therefore devel-
oped a substrate derived from amino acid (AA) sites 278–281 of
the human tau protein, which was shown to be directly linked to
pathological tau aggregation.
26 This peptide, Ile-Asn-(dimethyl)
Lys-(ac)Lys was used for the development of our in-house

biochemical and cellular assays are chosen for

insights for future experiments. (7) Earmarked combinations and screening data are mapped to the knowledge graph to enhance future queries (see ‘‘General
applicability of the HBP’’ inresults). From here, an entry point of interest can be selected to reinitiate the pipeline.

speciﬁc standard inhibitors, vorinostat (SAHA) and trichostatin A.
These inhibitors had half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC

similar to those found in a histone-based HDAC6 assay (6.2 nM

lapping speciﬁcity of the two catalytic HDAC6 domains,29 but
also demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and the direct
involvement of HDAC6 at K281 deacetylation of human tau. To
identify promising HDAC6 inhibitors that can modulate its activity
on human tau, we screened a collection of drugs to identify those
with the greatest effect on tau peptide deacetylation.

listed as one of the druggable secondary targets,
HDAC6 was further investigated using this tool. This

HDAC6 (indicated by ‘‘c’’) blocks (crossed out

fect indicated by ‘‘d,’’ dotted arrow; reduction of
pTau is indicated in red) by indirectly preventing
phosphorylation at key residues through remaining
acetylation (green). The edges (left and right)
marked with the same lowercase letter correspond
to each other.
In total, 5,632 compounds were
screened on 16 plates with a z0 exceeding
0.5 on all plates. The average signal inten-
sity of all data points was 1.4% inhibition,
indicating no systematic errors were pre-
sent within the screening, with a standard
deviation of 0.35. Interestingly, 65% of
the 279 active molecules from the primary screening were
conﬁrmed as hits, with a hit being deﬁned as a compound
showing at least 75% inhibition. Such a conﬁrmation rate is
reasonable for this type of complex and coupled enzymatic
assay. To validate the 183 conﬁrmed active compounds, a sec-
ond HDAC6 screening was conducted in addition to dose
response studies (Figure 3D). This assay employing a shorter,
less speciﬁc peptide derived from histone H3 resulted in 104
compounds inhibiting to at least 75%. From these, 23 molecules
were found to be speciﬁc for the histone H3 substrate, and 81 in-
hibited the conversion of both substrates. As a result, 102 com-
pounds from the tau-based screening were speciﬁc for this

and 3D). In the following step, their activities were conﬁrmed,
and the 20 molecules that speciﬁcally were found to be the
most active in inhibiting tau-based substrate conversion and
had favorable physicochemical properties (Figure 3; Table S3)
were selected. Suitable properties included drug likeliness, tak-
ing into account molecular weight (MW), solubility, and rule of
ﬁve criteria,
30 as well as likeliness for central nervous system
(CNS) penetration (topological polar surface area [TPSA] below
100) and having fewer than 8 rotatable bonds, although certain
molecules were still included even if one of the rules was violated
(Table S4). These compounds were further validated using west-
ern blots against pTau (Figures 3E and 3F). The reduced phos-
phorylation of tau further demonstrated the applicability of
HDAC6 inhibitors in the context of tau hyperphosphorylation
and may represent promising avenues for AD therapy.
Mapping identiﬁed HDAC6 inhibitors to the HBP
The compounds found to inhibit HDAC6 activity were queried
against the ChEMBL database to determine any additional
drug targets for these molecules (Figure 4A). During data collec-
tion, we made sure that two parameters were controlled:
pCHEMBL >6 and conﬁdence level >7 were used. A pCHEMBL
value of more than 6 signiﬁes that all measurementss of inhibition
are less than 1mM (pIC
50 = negative log 6 [IC50 in mM]). The con-
ﬁdence level corresponds to the ChEMBL conﬁdence score (see
https://chembl.gitbook.io/chem bl-interface-documentation/
frequently-asked-questions/chembl-data-questions).With these
two parameters, we were able to control the quality of the data
sampled as well as the potency of the interactions surveyed.
Of the 20 compounds, 17 were found to interact with targets
other than HDAC6. Using information collected from the
GWAS Catalog,
31 a list of known, disease-associated genes
was compiled based on identiﬁed single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) (p < 10/C07) and compared against the compound
targets. Only four of the drugs—quercetin (ChEMBL:
CHEMBL50), GW441756X (ChEMBL:CHEMBL1516890), Debio
1347 (ChEMBL:CHEMBL3907479), and indirubin-3
0-monoxime
(ChEMBL:CHEMBL216543)—targeted proteins that were found
to be associated with AD (Figure 4B; Data S3). It was not surpris-
ing that quercetin and GW441756X would have additional tar-
gets of interest, as these compounds were found to interact
with the greatest number of molecules from those in our list (80
and 62, respectively). Interestingly, of the eight overlapping hits
from the AD association analysis, three were found to be tar-
geted by multiple drugs in our list. CDK1 and CSNK2A1 are
both targets of quercetin and GW441756X, while GSK3B was
also found to be modulated by these compounds as well as in-
dirubin-3
0-monoxime. Based on the information collected from
the GWAS Catalog, we were able to calculate what percentage
of each compound’s target list was associated with AD (Fig-
ure 4C). We found that indirubin-30-monoxime had the highest

Debio-1347 had the second highest score at 14.7%. This sug-
gests that indirubin-3 0-monoxime would have the greatest
chance of repurposing due to its strong focus on AD-related
targets.
To extract additional information on the candidate compounds
in relation to the primary (pTau)/secondary (HDAC6) targets,
queries consisting of concepts and keywords were generated
and executed using https://pharmacome.scaiview.com/ (Fig-
ure 4D; Data S4). Debio-1347 was not found in the context of
HDAC6, MAPT, or AD, whereas quercetin has clear connections
to these molecules (230 and 1,416 mentions, respectively) and
AD (1,679 mentions). Meanwhile, both indirubin-3
0-monoxime
and GW441756X were found to be mentioned in publications in
association with MAPT (13 and 4 mentions, respectively) and
AD (6 and 7 mentions, respectively). Next, we searched both
ClinicalTrials.gov and patent literature for recent information on
the candidate compounds and any ongoing investigations into
their therapeutic uses. Again, among these four compounds,
only quercetin has been used in a clinical trial performed in the
context of AD (a total of 4 trials were found). A patent search via
dedicated concept queries and analysis of disease-related topics
(Medical Subject Headings [MeSH]) extended the coverage of the
elucidated contextual information. For Debio-1347 and
GW441756X compounds, cancer-related terms dominated the
results, with a relevance score (Kullback-Leibler divergence) of
6.12 for ‘‘small cell lung carcinoma’’ (Debio-1347) and 5.98 for
‘‘glioblastoma’’ (GW441756X), whereas indirubin-3
0-monoxime
appeared in an inﬂammatory context ﬁrst (‘‘prostatitis’’ relevance
score: 3.67), followed by ‘‘hemangiosarcoma’’ (relevance score:
3.65). For quercetin, a broad range of disease context information
could be identiﬁed (Figures S4 and S5; Data S4). All four com-

pounds were mentioned together with the
MeSH terms ‘‘arthritis,’’ ‘‘asthma,’’ ‘‘coli-
tis,’’ ‘‘ﬁbrosis,’’ ‘‘hemangiosarcoma,’’
‘‘multiple myeloma,’’ ‘‘psoriasis,’’ ‘‘stom-
ach neoplasm,’’ and ‘‘wounds and in-
juries.’’ Only patents containing the com-
pounds quercetin and indirubin-3
0-
monoxime speciﬁcally contained MeSH
terms in the context of neurodegenerative disorders (quercetin:
‘‘Alzheimer disease,’’ ‘‘Parkinson disease,’’ ‘‘nervous system dis-
eases’’; both: ‘‘plaque, amyloid’’).
Because of their relevance to AD ( Figure 4B), these four
selected compounds and their identiﬁed targets were mapped
to the HBP to improve the performance of subsequent iterations
of the pipeline. A new node was created for any drug or protein
that did not already exist within the network, and generated
edges were annotated with the parsed interaction information.
In summary, our computational analysis identiﬁed repurposing
candidate compounds based on their proximity to protein tar-
gets and biological pathways relevant to AD pathology. Among
those, indirubin-3
0-monoxime had the highest score based on
the ratio of AD-relevant genes and pathways it targets, suggest-
ing that it would serve as a suitable, focused therapeutic, while
minimizing potential side effects due to off-target interactions.
Furthermore, cellular characterization of AD-relevant cell types
and evidence collected from literature that include this com-
pound revealed the mechanism by which it can positively regu-
late AD, thereby strengthening it as a potential repurposing
candidate and further validating our pipeline.
General applicability of the HBP
With the HBP, we have created a computational model that links
drugs, their targets, and highly associated mechanisms. This
complex framework of interactions spans multiple modalities
and consists of biological processes complemented by highly
granular representations of biological mechanisms. Though
this model focuses primarily on AD, it can also be used to explore
other diseases that share pathological aspects with AD. The
HBP is enriched with qualitative and quantitative data, thus facil-
itating the ability to ﬁlter data using a variety of metadata, the

mental data.
Though our pipeline was initiated using a modiﬁed protein, it is
not limited to this type of entity. A primary target can also be a
biological process in the form of a single entity or an entire sub-
graph. A drug could also serve as the starting point forin silico
processing and in vitro validation (or vice versa). The ﬂexibility
of this workﬂow enables far-reaching possibilities in terms of po-
tential biological questions and hypothesis generation.
For example, assume that a biological process, such as auto-
phagy, is the entry point (primary target) of our workﬂow. Patho-
logical autophagic processes play an essential role across dis-
eases
32 as in AD.33 Therefore, this primary target would allow
one to start from thein vitroperspective and answer the following
question: Which repurposing compounds have a regulatory ef-
fect on autophagy? In a subsequent step, one could determine
where the compound-speciﬁc targets (secondary targets) are
located in the graph. These targets could be in a relationship
with autophagy itself or affect a process or another protein target
that are elements of the autophagic process. This information
can be used to hypothesize potential mechanisms of action in
the autophagy context, which in turn could be tested via appro-
priate in vitroassays. In theory, the HBP could provide possible
explanations for how compounds work in the autophagy
context.
In summary, our network and the associated hybrid workﬂow
offer a wide range of opportunities to answer open questions in
the search for appropriate approaches to new therapeutic treat-
ments, extending beyond the context of AD.
DISCUSSION
AD research has suffered greatly from a lack of successful clin-
ical trials and a scarcity of effective treatment options.
2 It has
taken 18 years for a new drug, the antibody aducanumab which
reduces Ab plaques in AD patients,34 to be approved, but its ef-
ﬁcacy is highly controversial.35 These shortcomings are due in
part to our lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms
governing the disease, resulting in massive loss of time and
money spent testing compounds that were not well understood.
To avoid repeating such mistakes, we have developed the HBP,
a comprehensive network of molecular interactions focused on
the pathways and mechanisms that regulate the pathophysi-
ology of AD.
Here, we demonstrated that the HBP can aid researchers in
quickly screening and identifying novel therapeutics by applying
the principles of drug repurposing to AD. In our example, we
experimentally validated 5,632 compounds against HDAC6, a
secondary interactor that was identiﬁed by our pipeline as being
a druggable regulator of our biomarker of interest, pTau. Our re-
sults showed that of the compounds screened, 183 successfully
increased the amount of acetylated tau, thereby decreasing the
number of sites available for phosphorylation. Further character-
ization of these compounds revealed that four compounds
already had links to AD (quercetin, GW441756X, indirubin-3-
monoxime and Debio-1347), and as a result, metadata for these
compounds were gathered and added to the HBP via text mining
and table extraction approaches for use in subsequent iterations
of the workﬂow.
To ascertain their potential in treating AD, we investigated our
list of compounds and found evidence to support our selection.
Quercetin is a ﬂavonoid found in fruits and vegetables and has a
wide range of biological associations, such as anti-carcinogenic,
anti-inﬂammatory, and anti-viral activity.
36 GW441756X (syno-
nym: GW-441756, see ChEMBL1516890) is a tropomyosin re-
ceptor kinase A (TrkA) inhibitor. 37 TrkA signaling has been
recently described as a potential therapeutic target for pain38
and, moreover, is suggested to contribute to degeneration of
basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), which is associ-
ated with cognitive decline in AD.39 Debio-1347 is a selective
ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor and exhibits
high antitumor activity. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and
their receptors have been shown to be involved in the pathogen-
esis of Parkinson disease and AD.
40,41 Indirubin-30-monoxime is
an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs), and
recently inhibitors of these enzymes have been of interest for
the treatment of cancer. CDK isoforms have also been shown
to play a key role in cancer proliferation via abnormal cell-cycle
regulation.
42 Interestingly, indirubin-30-monoxime is described
to play a role in neuronal apoptosis in AD,43 and in Sf9 cells ex-
pressing human tau 23, the compound was found to suppress
tau phosphorylation.44
Though these compounds all had links to AD and were of great
interest to our drug repurposing efforts, one of them did not have
enough metadata available for proper analysis because it is rela-
tively novel. Indeed, VU0361737, a positive allosteric modulator
(PAM) of metabotropic glutamate receptors,
45 did show prom-
ising results in our pTau speciﬁc assay. Interestingly, this com-
pound is mentioned in a patent together with HDAC6 and
MAPT (US patent 10500232); however, no focus on neurodegen-
eration is described.
The presented examples also highlight another problem of
drug discovery approaches that target neurodegenerative dis-
eases, which is the complexity of the underlying biology. Human
tau can be phosphorylated at 85 different sites within the protein,
and each site plays a different role in regard to microtubule bind-
ing and aggregation.
46 Two important post-translational modiﬁ-
cations that have arguably the largest inﬂuence on activity of tau
are phosphorylation and acetylation. Tau can be acetylated at
more than 20 sites
47 by p300 or CREB binding protein or via au-
toacetylation48 and deacetylated by SIRT1 and HDAC6.48 Some
of these acetylations are critical for tauopathies, for example,
K280 and K281, on which the peptidic substrate of this work
was based.
47 Unfortunately, the regulation of the acetylation pat-
terns and their effect on phosphorylation and aggregation are
complex. This complexity extends to the proteins responsible
for the post-translational modiﬁcations, such as the protective
versus detrimental effects of both SIRT1 and HDAC6 in terms
of known tauopathy symptoms.
49 While some groups report a
protective effect of HDAC6,50 others suggest that inhibiting this
protein can lead to improvement.51,52 Some of these effects
might be cell line speciﬁc or more relevant for certain tau iso-
forms, which adds another layer of complexity. The N2a cells
used in this study represent a simple and robust model, which
expresses many different tau isoforms.
53 More complex cell
lines54 as well as models based on induced pluripotent stem
(iPS) cells can be applied in the future55 to achieve a more pro-
found biological validation of the compounds for progression

Patterns 3, 100433, March 11, 20227 toward in vivoefﬁcacy testing, but this is beyond the scope of the
present study. Here, we emphasize the mechanism-centric
approach complemented by targeted experimental validation,
which should serve as an inspiration for the development of
new drug repurposing approaches. In the future, the HDAC6
modulators identiﬁed in this study may help to dissect some of
the contradicting effects observed by tau acetylation.
In silico methods are becoming increasingly important in the
pharmacological setting and have found their place alongside
in vitroand in vivomethods.
56,57 Combining in silicowith in vitro
techniques is a relatively new approach, but it shows enormous
potential in drug repurposing and drug discovery.
58 In particular,
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has helped
to rapidly advance these approaches, but it has also highlighted
its limitations.
59 Models are currently limited to what information
is present in databases and their underlying network, while limited
capabilities restrict what can be validated inin vitroexperiments.
Another essential factor to consider is the lack of understanding
of key biological mechanisms. With all these factors in mind, we
sought to address as many of them as possible using the high-level
HBP concept. The HBP beneﬁts from a unique constellation of
expertise, bothin silico and in vitro based, and through mutual
interaction, enrichment through the integration of experimental re-
sults, and periodic reviewing, the model continues to grow and
evolve resulting in a dynamic computational ecosystem.
We are aware that our HBP concept is not free of limitations and
biases. Directed data toward AD and tau pathology are comple-
mented by a largely unbiased collection of data to balance the
model. Other biases arise from our target-based ﬁltering criteria.
Selecting targets based on available screening data might intro-
duce historical bias and give more weight to unsuccessful targets
previously hyped, mostly in areas outside neurodegenerative
research. Moreover, the non-exhaustive number of patents cho-
sen as a ﬁltering criterion to favor targets might create a tendency
to exclude potentially robust, but underutilized targets associated
with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. We deliberately
chose these criteria to speciﬁcally highlight more novel targets
in the AD context. The use of protein-protein-interaction (PPI)
data to narrow down target candidates is a tool that should also
be considered with caution, as PPI data may not have been gener-
ated from CNS cells and may be limited in the types of target in-
teractions listed in the speciﬁc use case.
Our strategy is generalizable and applicable to a wide variety of
conditions as we have shown in Schultz et al.,
60 where we used a
similar drug target mechanism graph (COVID-19 PHARMACOME)
to predict the synergistic effect of speciﬁc drug pairs for combina-
tion therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our method is also ﬂexible
in terms of the entry point: from anin silico perspective, the
context-enriched, qualitative biomedical knowledge graph is
used to mine data related to drugs or targets to generate mecha-
nistic hypotheses that can be validated through experimental
testing. In turn, anin vitro-centric strategy would generate exper-
imental output about putative drug-target combinations or actions
of drugs on biological processes, which is then underpinned by
computational insights about associated biological mechanisms
as well as referential drug, target, genetic, and disease data.
With our drug repurposing strategy, we have found previously
unreported drug-target combinations that represent very inter-
esting candidates for AD therapeutic purposes. Furthermore,
we have gained knowledge about potential new targets through
our dynamic HBP concept. Our methodology and the resulting
ﬁndings could steer research in a new direction and pave the
way toward successful therapeutic intervention.
Data-driven approaches are increasingly in the spotlight as the
amount of available data and metadata grows and artiﬁcial intel-
ligence (AI) approaches offer a way to keep track and derive in-
sights. In particular, cross-validation over everything known,
mediated by an interplay ofin silicoand in vitroanalysis, repre-
sents a future path to knowledge discovery, especially for com-
plex diseases.

Methods
Generation of a compound screening library
The collection of 5,632 compounds was assembled by an external partner
(SPECS) in a manner aligned to the recommendations from the Broad Institute
(Cambridge, MA, USA).
61 In assembling this ‘‘mirror’’ collection, compounds
were purchased from the same set of more than 70 high-quality suppliers iden-
tiﬁed by the Broad Institute and quality controlled by liquid chromatography/
mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for purity and identity (minimum purity >90%).
Compounds at 10 mM were stored in 100% DMSO at/C020
/C14C. A curated data-
base is available containing the compound, indication, primary target (where
known), and mechanism of action as well as analysis tools that can assist in
mechanism of action determination and target elucidation.
61 In total, the library
contains 2,350 launched drugs, 95 withdrawn drugs, 1,600 drugs in clinical
phases, and 1,587 drugs in preclinical development.
Construction of an AD-centered OpenBEL model
We re-curated our existing AD model
62,63 and adapted all relations to the latest
version of OpenBEL (BEL v2.1;https://bel.bio/). BEL allows one to encode
causal and correlative relations between entities, including information such
as origin of the relation (PMID) and annotations of associated metadata
(e.g., species, tissue, assay, or disease). The revision was carried out using
deﬁned processes, implemented in the software systems e(BE:L) and Py-
BEL.
64 We expanded our model by further curation and enrichment proced-
ures to increase the granularity of the existing data and incorporated additional
biological information to sharpen the AD pathological picture (Table S1). In to-
tal, we curated 115 abstracts and 2,317 full-text articles, which yielded
159,962 relations (Table S1) with more than 7,350 annotations. Further,
13,580 drugs from DrugBank were mapped directly onto the HBP itself and
were supplemented with compounds extracted from ChEMBL. The tau sub-
graph was identiﬁed and labeled within the HBP and comprised 6,269 relations
(Table S1) with 1,161 unique annotations.
Enrichment of the OpenBEL model
To supplement our model with interactions that were not directly cited in the
curated publications, we compiled data from several repositories and
ll
OPEN ACCESS Article
8 Patterns 3, 100433, March 11, 2022 converted them into the OpenBEL format so that we could enrich our AD
model with established biological relationships and metadata (Table S2).
Pathway data from KEGG,65,66 Pathway Commons,67,68 and Reactome69
were transformed and normalized70 to complement our AD knowledge graph
as well as PPIs from IntAct,71 BioGRID,72 and StringDB73 As our primary goal
was to create a tool for investigating drug repurposing candidates, we also
included data form both DrugBank
74 and Clinical Trials75 to identify known
drug interactions and the disease contexts in which they were studied, respec-
tively. After this enrichment step, the total number of edges in our graph
increased to 728,809, while the tau subgraph grew to 7,100 relations.
Integration of quantitative information
To extract quantitative information, we employed our general-purpose table
extraction system that was developed to extract information from unstructured
scientiﬁc documents, in which relevant content is arranged in tabular format
(Figure S1). The details of this system are presented in Namysl et al.
76 Here,
we will give a brief overview of the table recognition method and highlight its
experimental evaluation.
We were able to parse two popular input formats: the born-digital PDF ﬁles
and the digitized document images. Our table recognition system employs
two ad hoc heuristics for table structure recognition. The ﬁrst heuristic recog-
nizes tables that are typeset with a LaTeX packagebooktabs. The second algo-
rithm handles the bordered table format. Moreover, the system includes a
regular expression- and graph-based table interpretation method for attri-
bute-value pairs extraction. This complementary table interpretation phase
additionally ensures that the tabular structure was correctly recognized. The
system was validated using two well-known table recognition bench-
marks.
77,78 It achieved results that are competitive with the best academic table
recognition approaches on the ICDAR 2013 benchmark,77 which consists of
digital-born government and business documents. The ﬂexibility of the system
was additionally validated using the ICDAR 2019 dataset,78 which comprises
low-quality scanned document images. In particular, our table recognition sys-
tem reached highest precision among the examined commercial and academic
table recognition methods on both datasets. For more details about the evalu-
ation using the general-purpose benchmarks, please refer to the article
describing our table recognition system.
76
Moreover, we evaluated our system using an in-house biomedical dataset
consisting of documents collected in the context of tau aggregation and
retrieved from PubMed Central.
79 The ground-truth annotations were gener-
ated semi-automatically from the XML article content and then manually
curated. In total, our benchmark consists of more than 1,100 PDF documents
containing over 1,600 tables. We compared our table recognition approach
with a leading commercial document analysis system and two popular
open-source table recognition toolkits. We outperformed all baselines in terms
of precision in this scenario. The detailed description of our biomedical bench-
marking dataset, the evaluation procedure, the experimental setup, and the re-
sults are presented in Adams et al.
80
Furthermore, inFigure S2, we present an example of a table recognized us-
ing our system.
Integration of contextual information
For retrieval of contextual information, we used our semantic search engine
https://pharmacome.scaiview.com/. This repository contains more than 37
million articles and 2.7 million reviews as well as more than 10 million patents.
More than 1.15 million documents were annotated with ontologies and ter-
minologies, including the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classiﬁca-
tion System, Bioassay Ontology (BAO), the Brain Region and Cell Type
terminology (BRCT), the DrugBank Database, HUGO Gene Nomenclature
Committee, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). We performed queries
to identify literature containing drug, target, and disease relations and used on-
tologies such as BAO to ﬁlter selectively for assay information. MeSH-speciﬁc
analytics in patents for selected candidate compounds was used to identify
disease-related terms, which were investigated in the context of the corre-
sponding compound (Figure S4). Terms were ranked according to Kullback-
Leibler divergence, an information-based measure of disparity among proba-
bility distributions.
81
Selection of disease-related primary target/candidate compound
The HBP represents a high-level concept with various entry points, such as
genes, proteins, drugs, or even cellular processes. The primary target deﬁnes
the center node from which we start our mining routine.
Selection of the primary target in the context of AD was done based on one
of the following criteria:
d Biomarker qualiﬁed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (pTau)
d Suggested biomarker identiﬁed in relevant literature
d Drug action indicated to be signiﬁcantly relevant for AD therapeutic
intervention
Secondary target selection pipeline
As many therapeutic strategies focus on regulating a key biomarker directly
through compounds and medication, we chose to expand our range of targets
by ﬁrst establishing a workﬂow to identify interactors (secondary targets) that
work upstream of a given node (primary target). In short, the pipeline is initiated
with the gene symbol of a given protein of interest as well as with an optional
post-translational modiﬁcation. The node matching these parameters is iden-
tiﬁed within the graph, and a list comprised of neighboring nodes found to have
a ‘‘causal’’ relationship to the matched node is generated. Individual proteins
are extracted from these identiﬁed neighbors and are considered a possible
secondary protein-target interactor.
For a secondary target to be valid for further consideration, the following
conditions were deﬁned:
d Druggability: A drug or compound targets and modulates the activity of
the protein. Proteins in the model have links to drugs and compounds
extracted from DrugBank as well as those added by experimental ev-
idence.
d Known mechanism of action of secondary target on primary candidate:
The effect of the secondary target on the primary candidate (either acti-
vation or inhibition) must be known to discern the outcome of a drug on
the activity/abundance of the primary target.
Identiﬁed secondary targets were further ﬁltered based on following criteria:
d Promiscuity: Proteins within our model that are considered ‘‘hubs’’
(edge count >1,000) were excluded from our list. Targeting such pro-
teins would likely result in unforeseen downstream effects in associated
pathways and processes.
d High assayability: To verify our ﬁndings, secondary targets for which an
assay exists that allows one to measure their effect on the activity or
abundance of the primary target were given preference.
d PubChem BioAssays: The number of assays available according to
PubChem
82 were considered during evaluation. Secondary targets
were excluded and labeled with ‘‘suboptimal experimental accessi-
bility’’ when no conﬁrmatory assay was given, while the highest
numbers were taken as a measure for ‘‘degree of focus of interest.’’
d Interaction type: secondary targets that could not be clearly conﬁrmed
as direct interactors modulating pTau were excluded.
PPI analysis
A PPI analysis was performed to limit the list of druggable pTau modulators to
possible direct interactors. We extracted our druggable targets list from BiKMi
and compared these PPI data with four other sources: IntAct, BioGRID,
Pathway Commons, and StringDB. Selection criteria were applied only when
extracting data from String DB. It was speciﬁed that for a valid interaction an
experiment had to be present. Targets were sorted by frequency of occur-
rence. Targets that occurred repeatedly in three or four sources were recog-
nized as putative MAPT interactors with direct inﬂuence on pTau. Targets
with fewer than two mentions were manually reviewed and rejected if biolog-
ical data indicated an indirect inﬂuence on pTau (e.g., signaling cascades
between primary and secondary target) and/or if a direct inﬂuence on phos-
phorylation could not be supported by a study. For each putative direct modu-
lator of pTau, a reference was given.
Drug prioritization pipeline
Once secondary targets were identiﬁed and ﬁltered, a list of drugs and com-
pounds was generated for each protein. Each compound was ranked using
the available metadata:
d Primary target outcome: The effect of the drug on its target results in the
desired downstream change in activity or abundance of the primary
ll
OPEN ACCESSArticle
Patterns 3, 100433, March 11, 20229 target. Drugs producing unknown or undesirable outcomes were
excluded from further analysis.
d Patent: Drugs that are currently patented were not prioritized.
d Clinical trials: Drugs that have not been tested in a clinical stage II trial in
context of AD were preferred.
d Generics: Drugs with generic, cost-effective versions available were
preferred over drugs that are on patent.
d Promiscuity: Compounds with fewer targets (thus being more speciﬁc)
were ranked higher than those that bound non-speciﬁcally to a wide
range of proteins.
HDAC activity assay
The assay analyzing the tau-based substrate was designed around a coupled
enzymatic reaction (Figures 3A and 3B). Deacetylation of a luciferi- labeled
substrate peptide through HDAC6 allows for trypsin, a serine protease, to
cleave an N-terminal aminoluciferin, thereby enabling a quantiﬁable biolumi-
nescent reaction. Assays were performed in 384-well microtiter plates (Greiner
784904) with 15mL total volume. Before the assay, 20 nL of compound or con-
trol substance was added to designated wells using an Echo550 liquid handler
(Beckman Coulter, USA). Initially, 10 mL enzyme buffer containing 2 nM
HDAC6, 50mM aminoluciferin peptide, and 0.05% BSA in HEPES buffer solu-
tion (25 mM, with added 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgCl
2,p H7 )
was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After
incubation, 5 mL of detection reagent (0.5mg luciferase [Biomol, Germany])
(ﬁnal concentration 0.067 mg/mL), 2 mg trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
(0.133 mg/mL), and 400mM ATP (Jena Bioscience, Germany) (ﬁnal concentra-
tion 133mM) in HEPES (25 mM, with added 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and
1 mM MgCl2, pH 7) were added and measured directly using an EnVision multi-
mode reader (PerkinElmer, USA) at 200 ms integration time.
To analyze a histone-based peptide substrate, HDAC-Glo I/II Assay and
Screening System (Promega, USA) was used according to the instructions
of the manufacturer. Brieﬂy, reagents were prepared as described in the
manual, and plates and compounds were handled as described previously.
HDAC6 was added to all wells in 5mL assay buffer (0.2 nM, ﬁnal concentration
0.1 nM) and incubated for 10 min. Afterward, 5mL of substrate reaction was
added and incubated for 10 min followed by luciferase measurement using
an EnVision multimode reader as described previously. Assay quality was
assured by Z
0 calculation with all plates above 0.5 regarded as valid.

Neuro-2a cells were cultivated in 75 cm
2 ﬂasks using DMEM with penicillin
(100 U/mL), streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL), L-glutamine (2 mM), and FBS (10%).
Medium was changed every third day, and cells were incubated at 37/C14Ca n d
5% CO2. Passaging was done in 1:5 dilution, as soon as conﬂuency was
around 90%, usually once a week. For cell seeding, the monolayer was
washed using 10 mL PBS, followed by detachment and dissociation of cells
using 1.5 mL of 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA solution (Capricorn Scientiﬁc,
Germany) for 3 min at 37
/C14C. Cells were resuspended in culture medium,
centrifuged at 300 3 g for 5 min, resuspended in fresh medium, and
counted.
Cells were seeded at 500,000 cells per well in non-coated 6-well plates
(Greiner BioOne, Germany). After 12 h, compounds and controls were added
at the desired concentrations in 4 mL total volume and incubated for an addi-
tional 12 h. After treatment, the wells were washed with PBS for 3 min, and
150 mL lysis buffer (RIPA buffer [Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA] supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails [both Sigma-Aldrich, USA])
was applied, followed by a shaking incubation for 10 min on ice. Cells were
scraped off, collected in Eppendorf tubes, and centrifuged (213 g at 4
/C14C)
for 10 min. The supernatant was collected in a separate tube, and protein con-
centration was measured using Pierce BCA Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scienti-
ﬁc, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
For western blot experiments, protein from cell lysates was prepared in
loading buffer and reducing agent. In each sample, 24mg protein, 3mL1 03
SDS, and 7.5mL4 3 LDS were ﬁlled with deionized H
2O to a ﬁnal volume of
30 mL. Contents of each tube were boiled at 95/C14C for 10 min. Gradient gels
(1.0 mm, 4%–12% [Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA]) were used and run using
MOPS buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA) for 45–60 min at 200 V and
4
/C14C. Protein transfer was done as a ""wet"" transfer using activated polyvinyli-
dene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane for 1 h at 400 mA at 4/C14C.
After protein transfer, membranes were washed in TBS-T twice for 5 min and
blocked in 5% BSA in TBS-T for 1 h. Primary antibodies were applied in different
dilutions (monoclonal mouse anti-a-tubulin [DM1A] 1:2,000, Cell Signaling, Cat.
No. 3873; monoclonal rabbit anti-acetyl-a-tubulin [Lys40] 1:800, Cell Signaling,
Cat. No. 5335; polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-Tau [Ser396] 1:500, Invitrogen,
Cat. No. 44-752G; monoclonal mouse anti-Tau antibody [HT7] 1:100, Invitro-
gen, Cat. No. MN1000) in blocking buffer overnight on a spinner at 4
/C14C. Tubulin
and tau levels, either total protein levels or post-translational modiﬁcations,
were detected simultaneously. After washing for 5 min, 3 times with TBS-T,
the secondary antibody (WS HRP polyclonal goat anti-mouse, Li-Cor, Cat.
No. A11029; WS HRP polyclonal goat anti-rabbit, Li-Cor, Cat. No. A31576)
was applied at 1:15,000 dilution for 1 h in the dark on a spinner at 4
/C14C. After-
ward, the membrane was washed 3 times for 5 min each with PBS and analyzed
using chemiluminescent detection reagent (Li-Cor, USA).
After detection, the membranes were stripped to apply a different set of an-
tibodies. Therefore, the membrane was washed with PBS, then a western blot
stripping buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA) was applied for 7 min. After
washing (33 5 min, PBS), the membranes could be blocked again and sub-
jected to the next antibody. Rabbit antibodies were generally applied ﬁrst, fol-
lowed by the antibodies raised in mouse.
Validated compound target comparison against disease-speciﬁc
proteins
Experimentally validated compounds were initially selected and tested based
on their downstream effect on the primary target via a speciﬁc secondary in-
teractor. However, drugs often interact with several different components,
thereby requiring one to assess how each compound ﬁts into the disease-spe-
ciﬁc interactome. To this end, we compiled a list of all known targets for each
compound that passed the experimental screening and compared them
against those known to be associated with AD. Drug targets were collected
from the ChEMBL database, while genes of SNPs that were found to have a
signiﬁcant link (p < 53 10
/C07) with AD were collected from the GWAS Catalog
dataset stored within our knowledge graph. The resulting overlapping set of
symbols and their found drug interactions were subsequently mapped to the
knowledge graph to be used as new starting points for the workﬂow described
above.

OPEN ACCESSArticle
Patterns 3, 100433, March 11, 202213 ","The article discusses various databases and tools used for drug repurposing and pathway analysis, particularly focusing on Alzheimer's disease. It mentions several resources such as DrugBank, KEGG, Pathway Commons, Reactome, IntAct, BioGRID, STRING, and others. The text also highlights the use of computational methods like PyBEL for biological expression language and ComPath for exploring mappings across pathway databases. Additionally, it references table recognition systems used in biomedical literature related to neurological disorders and discusses updates to ClinicalTrials.gov's results database.","The high number of failed pre-clinical and clinical studies for compounds targeting Alzheimer disease (AD) has demonstrated that there is a need to reassess existing strategies. Here, we pursue a holistic, mechanism-centric drug repurposing approach combining computational analytics and experimental screening data. Based on this integrative workflow, we identified 77 druggable modifiers of tau phosphorylation (pTau). One of the upstream modulators of pTau, HDAC6, was screened with 5,632 drugs in a tau-specific assay, resulting in the identification of 20 repurposing candidates. Four compounds and their known targets were found to have a link to AD-specific genes. Our approach can be applied to a variety of AD-associated pathophysiological mechanisms to identify more repurposing candidates.","Aging societies face a rapidly growing number of people suffering from AD, resulting in an enormous socioeconomic burden.1 Billions of dollars are invested to address this problem, but despite all efforts to find effective therapeutics, treatment options are sparse and have largely failed to achieve satisfying results in the fight against AD. More than 100 candidate compounds were abandoned in development or showed disappointing results in clinical trials (CTs), leaving only a limited number of remedies that are currently approved and used for symptomatic treatment of AD.2 THE BIGGER PICTURE Owing to current setbacks in the discovery and development of novel treatments tackling Alzheimer disease (AD), a re-evaluation of research and development (R&D) strategies is underway. Here, we present a holistic pharmacological approach that combines drug-target information with knowledge graphs that represent essential pathophysiology mechanisms. The resulting Human Brain Pharmacome (HBP) embeds hundreds of relevant drug-target interactions in the context of disease mechanisms governing AD. We demonstrate how such a tool can be used to aid AD research by identifying already-approved drugs that have the potential to treat the disease, thereby bypassing the expensive and time-consuming task of researching and developing a new drug. In our study, we identified new drug-target combinations and provided mechanistic explanations that help to improve our understanding of AD pathology and support future development of effective therapeutic strategies. Development/Pre-production: Data science output has been rolled out/validated across multiple domains/problems Patterns 3, 100433, March 11, 2022a 2022 The Authors. 1 This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). ll OPEN ACCESS Why do CTs in AD treatment continue to fail? An incomplete understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, erroneous selection of target and drug candidates, shortcomings of pre-clinical animal models, wrong drug dosage regimens, and false recruiting of best responders are some of the reasons why these clinical studies have so far failed.3,4 Novel therapeutic avenues must be established, and achieving this requires a re-evaluation of the strategies currently used. Drug repurposing, the process of identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, has grown in popularity in recent years and has been shown to be quite successful.5,6 This strategy, also referred to as drug repositioning, offers an enormous advantage: substances that have already been well examined and approved with a wide spectrum of data, including safety and efficiency profiles, can be critically evaluated in a new disease context. Drug repurposing maximizes the therapeutic application of drugs while minimizing the risk of failure, leading to a reduced period of time by which they are ready for the market with a new indication context.7 Repositioning of drugs can be driven by structuralin silicoanalyses (e.g., molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, or cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) or X-ray structural determination)8 or by the experimental domain (in vitro biochemical and cellular assays, high-throughput screening, in vivo animal tests),9,10 or approached through a combination of both fields.11 Generally, drug repurposing strategies are drug, target, or disease centric depending on the research focus or pharmaceutical interest.12 In a drug-centric approach, a drug is connected to a formerly unknown target (off-target) and its target-associated indications, whereas in a target-centric approach, the drug-target relationship is known (on-target) and linked to a new therapeutic context. New avenues of drug repurposing are being explored, including signature-based approaches that focus on evidence-driven identification of new repurposing compounds,13 which is in line with our mechanism-oriented strategy. In the repurposing approach described here, we are not restricted to a single approach, therefore allowing greater flexibility in terms of repositioning candidate identification. We combined knowledge mined from a variety of sources with focused experimental screening data of selected drug candidates into our drug-target-mechanism-oriented data model, the Human Brain Pharmacome (HBP). Information retrieval and extraction were applied in a reciprocal manner for the enrichment of targets, ligands, chemical similarity, or assays in the HBP. The enrichment of our computational model was complemented by information extracted from the patent literature as well as quantitative information extracted from tables in published articles. Dedicated mining strategies enabled us to use this information for drug/target prospective and retrospective validation as well as for assay refinement. The dynamic nature of literature and the continuous research efforts in AD prompted us to develop and implement processes for progressive updates of the knowledge graph with several internal checks to ensure that novel and even controversial findings were added back to the HBP with full provenance of the information source. Here, we demonstrate our approach in an AD-biomarker-centric search strategy. The HBP model includes a highly granular representation of mechanistic underpinnings of tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of abnormal microtubule-associated tau protein (MAPT) in the brain in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).14,15 Phosphorylation of MAPT (pTau), and thus creation of insoluble aggregates, is considered one of the key regulatory factors that drives AD pathology, and its abundance is used as a predictive biomarker of AD.16 Based on our work in the pTau context, we implemented a generalizable workflow (Figure 1; Video S1) for the identification of new druggable targets in relation to AD-specific pathophysiology processes. In ourin silico-driven knowledge mining approach, we focused on mechanisms related to post-translational modifications. Starting with pTau as the root node (primary target, see methods), we sought to answer the following questions in the context of this AD pathological hallmark: 1) Are there druggable targets (secondary targets, see methods) that modulate pTau? 2) Which of the targets identified in (1) are putative repurposing targets based on qualitative and quantitative data analysis? 3) Which repurposing compounds are highly active in our pTau-focused experimental setting? 4) Can we validate unknown drug-target pairs in the context of AD therapeutics?","The HBP We created a drug- and mechanism-oriented model, the HBP, that covers a broad spectrum of biological processes relevant in the pathophysiological context of AD (Figures 2A and 2B). By augmenting it with metadata, quantitative data, and contextual information, we have created a comprehensive framework forin silico identification of druggable mechanisms and a broad information base for evaluating potential therapeutic targets and agents. Identification of druggable modulators of pTau Using our secondary target selection pipeline (see methods), we identified 77 druggable targets (cited in 155 documents) that also have an upstream causal interaction with pTau (Figures 2A and 2C; Data S1). Our initial list contained proteins from several different gene families: MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, MAPK9, MAPK10, MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13, and MAPK14 (mitogen-activated protein kinases); PPP1CA, PPP2CA, PPP2CB, PPP3CA, and PPP5C (protein phosphatase catalytic subunits); PPP2R1A and PPP2R2A (protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunits); S100A1 and S100B (S100 calcium binding proteins); CDK1, CDK2, CDK5, and CDK5R1 (cyclin dependent kinases); CAMK2A and CAMK2B (calmodulin dependent protein kinases); and ABL1 and ABL2 (Abl family tyrosine kinases). Cross-validation of protein-protein-interaction data from several resources (IntAct, BioGRID, Pathway Commons, STRING, https://bikmi.pharmacome.scaiview.com/) confirmed 54 of these targets as direct interactors of pTau (Data S2). Qualitative and quantitative data analysis reveal putative repurposing targets One of our primary goals was to find new or repurposed compounds for treating pTau in the context of AD. To this end, we performed a statistical analysis of the secondary target metadata to identify the best candidate for additional screening (Data S1). First, we determined the number of BioAssays available for each secondary target to evaluate which of our candidate proteins had the most screening data available. These calculations are indicative of the number of known drug-target interactions as confirmed by several independent studies and serve as better values to evaluate protein/compound associations as opposed to looking purely at drugs that are approved and on the market. Our search resulted in a list of the top five ranked proteins: HDAC6, ABL1, CDK2, MAPK14, and SRC with 1,938, 1,929, 1,518, 1,490, and 1,363 BioAssay mentions, respectively. We then calculated the ratio of these counts to the number of available drugs for each protein, thereby determining which candidates had the greatest opportunity for drug repurposing exploration. Based on the information mined from DrugBank, HDAC6 had the highest BioAssay-to-known-drug ratio of the top five candidates with 1,938 available assays at the time of writing and only six approved drugs on the market, thus making it a prime candidate for testing potential new therapeutic compounds. Additionally, among the top five ranked proteins, HDAC6 had the fewest mentions within the parsed corpus of patents. Furthermore, research into the current clinical trial landscape revealed that there is only one trial in the recruiting phase in context of both AD and an approved HDAC6 selective compound (NCT03056495; Data S1). Therefore, assay availability, the lack of market-available or patented drugs, and the sparse clinical focus strongly argue in favor of HDAC6 as a suitable target candidate to demonstrate our repurposing selection workflow. Secondary-target candidate selection: HDAC6 Research into HDAC6 revealed that it was previously the focus of cancer research 20 owing to its role in chromatin remodeling, cell motility, and gene regulation.21 However, HDAC6 activity has also been shown to influence the structure of microtubules, thus making it an enticing candidate in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.22,23 Interestingly, the HBP revealed a new potential intervention pathway: HDAC6 was shown to have a direct influence on acetylation of pTau.19 According to Carlomagno et al., HDAC6 mediated deacetylation of tau at certain sites (such as K321; Figure 3A), which also allow for phosphorylation of the tau protein (pTau).24 One such study reported that HDAC6 activity at K280 and K281 positively correlated with the pTau protein abundance,25 while another group demonstrated that a direct acetylation of MAPT was shown to favor the generation of pathological pTau aggregates.26 The study mentioned first suggests that the inhibition of HDAC6 and thereby the acetylation of K280 and K281, should lead to a decrease in harmful pTau aggregation by indirectly preventing phosphorylation from taking place at key residues. We have adapted this information in our hypothesis (Figure 2C). Though the dynamics of the post-translational modifications of MAPT, their mutual influence, and the downstream effects on the formation of pathological tau tangles are not fully understood, especially in a human context, HDAC6 does appear to have a central role in which disease-relevant signal cascades in AD are integrated. Experimental validation of HDAC6 and candidate compounds As classical HDAC6 assays often use consensus sequences derived from histone substrates, we sought to use a more specific readout for our experimental validation step. We therefore developed a substrate derived from amino acid (AA) sites 278–281 of the human tau protein, which was shown to be directly linked to pathological tau aggregation.26 This peptide, Ile-Asn-(dimethyl) Lys-(ac)Lys was used for the development of our in-house Figure 1. Generalized workflow for identifying novel therapeutic strategies (1) A knowledge-based ‘‘cause-and-effect’’ disease model (here: Alzheimer disease) is initiated using manually curated information as well as standardized data from reputable repositories (see ‘‘The HBP’’ in results). (2) An entry point (primary target; here: pTau) associated with a pathophysiology mechanism of interest is selected, and upstream regulators (secondary interactors) modulating key elements of this mechanism are identified (see ‘‘Identification of druggable modulators of pTau’’ in results). (3) The secondary interactors are ranked according to chosen criteria, and the top hits are selected for further evaluation (see ‘‘Qualitative and quantitative data analysis reveal putative repurposing targets’’ and ‘‘Secondary-target candidate selection: HDAC6 ’’ in results). (4) Suitable biochemical and cellular assays are chosen for testing the activities of a library of compounds against top secondary interactors (see ‘‘Experimental validation of HDAC6 and candidate compounds’’ in results). (5) Experimental results are quantitatively analyzed to identify new repurposing drugs and compounds for each given secondary interactor (see ‘‘Mapping of identified HDAC6 inhibitors to the HBP’’ in results). (6) Novel target/compound combinations are designed and used to gain new insights for future experiments. (7) Earmarked combinations and screening data are mapped to the knowledge graph to enhance future queries (see ‘‘General applicability of the HBP’’ in results). From here, an entry point of interest can be selected to reinitiate the pipeline. HDAC6 assay (Figures 3A and 3B) and validated against two un-specific standard inhibitors, vorinostat (SAHA) and trichostatin A. These inhibitors had half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of 3.1 nM and 2 nM respectively, concentrations that are similar to those found in a histone-based HDAC6 assay (6.2 nM and 3.8 nM, respectively).28 This result not only reflects the overlapping specificity of the two catalytic HDAC6 domains,29 but also demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and the direct involvement of HDAC6 at K281 deacetylation of human tau. To identify promising HDAC6 inhibitors that can modulate its activity on human tau, we screened a collection of drugs to identify those with the greatest effect on tau peptide deacetylation. A B C Figure 2. Cause-and-effect model generation, enrichment, and identification of druggable modulators of pTau (A) Workflow illustrating the stepwise formation of a data-enriched cause-and-effect model, subsequent knowledge mining, and target analysis. (B) Beginning with the entire Human Brain PHARMACOME, a primary target is selected (pTau) and its cause-and-effect context (tau subgraph, magnified square) is defined. (C) Illustration of a drug-HDAC6-MAPT relational network17,18 in BiKMi, available at https://bikmi.pharmacome.scaiview.com/ left). The graph can be generated by applying the path query: From: ‘‘6675804’’, To: ‘‘MAPT’’, Depth 2-2. The ""Depth"" limits the size of the network by specifying the number of edge steps searched for between the ‘‘From’’ and ‘‘To’’ entities. Each node (box) represents a specific subject/object (according to BEL). Each edge (line) is a unique source of evidence. The graphical representations from BiKMi are simplified representations of BEL subgraphs. Because it was listed as one of the druggable secondary targets, HDAC6 was further investigated using this tool. This network provided evidence (evidence boxes not shown) that HDAC6 is known to deacetylate tau19 (edge highlighted with ‘‘a’’), which correlates with tau phosphorylation17 (edge highlighted with ‘‘b’’). As the network (left) indicates, pharmacological HDAC6 inhibition (edge highlighted with ‘‘c’’) resulted in reduced tau phosphorylation17 (edge highlighted with ‘‘d’’). Based on these known relationships, we hypothesized (right) that inhibition of HDAC6 (indicated by ‘‘c’’) blocks (crossed out edge) the tau deacetylation process (indicated by ‘‘a’’), which leads in turn to a decrease in pTau (effect indicated by ‘‘d,’’ dotted arrow; reduction of pTau is indicated in red) by indirectly preventing phosphorylation at key residues through remaining acetylation (green). The edges (left and right) marked with the same lowercase letter correspond to each other. In total, 5,632 compounds were screened on 16 plates with a z0 exceeding 0.5 on all plates. The average signal intensity of all data points was 1.4% inhibition, indicating no systematic errors were present within the screening, with a standard deviation of 0.35. Interestingly, 65% of the 279 active molecules from the primary screening were confirmed as hits, with a hit being defined as a compound showing at least 75% inhibition. Such a confirmation rate is reasonable for this type of complex and coupled enzymatic assay. To validate the 183 confirmed active compounds, a second HDAC6 screening was conducted in addition to dose response studies (Figure 3D). This assay employing a shorter, less specific peptide derived from histone H3 resulted in 104 compounds inhibiting to at least 75%. From these, 23 molecules were found to be specific for the histone H3 substrate, and 81 inhibited the conversion of both substrates. As a result, 102 compounds from the tau-based screening were specific for this substrate and subjected to dose response studies (Figures 3C and 3D). In the following step, their activities were confirmed, and the 20 molecules that specifically were found to be the most active in inhibiting tau-based substrate conversion and had favorable physicochemical properties (Figure 3; Table S3) were selected. Suitable properties included drug likeliness, taking into account molecular weight (MW), solubility, and rule of five criteria,30 as well as likeliness for central nervous system (CNS) penetration (topological polar surface area [TPSA] below 100) and having fewer than 8 rotatable bonds, although certain molecules were still included even if one of the rules was violated (Table S4). These compounds were further validated using western blots against pTau (Figures 3E and 3F). The reduced phosphorylation of tau further demonstrated the applicability of HDAC6 inhibitors in the context of tau hyperphosphorylation and may represent promising avenues for AD therapy. Mapping identified HDAC6 inhibitors to the HBP The compounds found to inhibit HDAC6 activity were queried against the ChEMBL database to determine any additional drug targets for these molecules (Figure 4A). During data collection, we made sure that two parameters were controlled: pCHEMBL >6 and confidence level >7 were used. A pCHEMBL value of more than 6 signifies that all measurementss of inhibition are less than 1mM (pIC 50 = negative log 6 [IC50 in mM]). The confidence level corresponds to the ChEMBL confidence score (see https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/frequently-asked-questions/chembl-data-questions).With these two parameters, we were able to control the quality of the data sampled as well as the potency of the interactions surveyed. Of the 20 compounds, 17 were found to interact with targets other than HDAC6. Using information collected from the GWAS Catalog,31 a list of known, disease-associated genes was compiled based on identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (p < 10/C07) and compared against the compound targets. Only four of the drugs—quercetin (ChEMBL: CHEMBL50), GW441756X (ChEMBL:CHEMBL1516890), Debio 1347 (ChEMBL:CHEMBL3907479), and indirubin-3 0-monoxime (ChEMBL:CHEMBL216543)—targeted proteins that were found to be associated with AD (Figure 4B; Data S3). It was not surprising that quercetin and GW441756X would have additional targets of interest, as these compounds were found to interact with the greatest number of molecules from those in our list (80 and 62, respectively). Interestingly, of the eight overlapping hits from the AD association analysis, three were found to be targeted by multiple drugs in our list. CDK1 and CSNK2A1 are both targets of quercetin and GW441756X, while GSK3B was also found to be modulated by these compounds as well as indirubin-3 0-monoxime. Based on the information collected from the GWAS Catalog, we were able to calculate what percentage of each compound’s target list was associated with AD (Figure 4C). We found that indirubin-30-monoxime had the highest score, with 33.3% of its targets being associated with AD, while Debio-1347 had the second highest score at 14.7%. This suggests that indirubin-3 0-monoxime would have the greatest chance of repurposing due to its strong focus on AD-related targets. To extract additional information on the candidate compounds in relation to the primary (pTau)/secondary (HDAC6) targets, queries consisting of concepts and keywords were generated and executed using https://pharmacome.scaiview.com/ (Figure 4D; Data S4). Debio-1347 was not found in the context of HDAC6, MAPT, or AD, whereas quercetin has clear connections to these molecules (230 and 1,416 mentions, respectively) and AD (1,679 mentions). Meanwhile, both indirubin-3 0-monoxime and GW441756X were found to be mentioned in publications in association with MAPT (13 and 4 mentions, respectively) and AD (6 and 7 mentions, respectively). Next, we searched both ClinicalTrials.gov and patent literature for recent information on the candidate compounds and any ongoing investigations into their therapeutic uses. Again, among these four compounds, only quercetin has been used in a clinical trial performed in the context of AD (a total of 4 trials were found). A patent search via dedicated concept queries and analysis of disease-related topics (Medical Subject Headings [MeSH]) extended the coverage of the elucidated contextual information. For Debio-1347 and GW441756X compounds, cancer-related terms dominated the results, with a relevance score (Kullback-Leibler divergence) of 6.12 for ‘‘small cell lung carcinoma’’ (Debio-1347) and 5.98 for ‘‘glioblastoma’’ (GW441756X), whereas indirubin-3 0-monoxime appeared in an inflammatory context first (‘‘prostatitis’’ relevance score: 3.67), followed by ‘‘hemangiosarcoma’’ (relevance score: 3.65). For quercetin, a broad range of disease context information could be identified (Figures S4 and S5; Data S4). All four compounds were mentioned together with the MeSH terms ‘‘arthritis,’’ ‘‘asthma,’’ ‘‘colitis,’’ ‘‘fibrosis,’’ ‘‘hemangiosarcoma,’’ ‘‘multiple myeloma,’’ ‘‘psoriasis,’’ ‘‘stomach neoplasm,’’ and ‘‘wounds and injuries.’’ Only patents containing the compounds quercetin and indirubin-3 0-monoxime specifically contained MeSH terms in the context of neurodegenerative disorders (quercetin: ‘‘Alzheimer disease,’’ ‘‘Parkinson disease,’’ ‘‘nervous system diseases’’; both: ‘‘plaque, amyloid’’). Because of their relevance to AD (Figure 4B), these four selected compounds and their identified targets were mapped to the HBP to improve the performance of subsequent iterations of the pipeline. A new node was created for any drug or protein that did not already exist within the network, and generated edges were annotated with the parsed interaction information. In summary, our computational analysis identified repurposing candidate compounds based on their proximity to protein targets and biological pathways relevant to AD pathology. Among those, indirubin-3 0-monoxime had the highest score based on the ratio of AD-relevant genes and pathways it targets, suggesting that it would serve as a suitable, focused therapeutic, while minimizing potential side effects due to off-target interactions. Furthermore, cellular characterization of AD-relevant cell types and evidence collected from literature that include this compound revealed the mechanism by which it can positively regulate AD, thereby strengthening it as a potential repurposing candidate and further validating our pipeline. General applicability of the HBP With the HBP, we have created a computational model that links drugs, their targets, and highly associated mechanisms. This complex framework of interactions spans multiple modalities and consists of biological processes complemented by highly granular representations of biological mechanisms. Though this model focuses primarily on AD, it can also be used to explore other diseases that share pathological aspects with AD. The HBP is enriched with qualitative and quantitative data, thus facilitating the ability to filter data using a variety of metadata, the development of specific assays, and the assessment of experimental data. Though our pipeline was initiated using a modified protein, it is not limited to this type of entity. A primary target can also be a biological process in the form of a single entity or an entire subgraph. A drug could also serve as the starting point forin silico processing and in vitro validation (or vice versa). The flexibility of this workflow enables far-reaching possibilities in terms of potential biological questions and hypothesis generation. For example, assume that a biological process, such as autophagy, is the entry point (primary target) of our workflow. Pathological autophagic processes play an essential role across diseases32 as in AD.33 Therefore, this primary target would allow one to start from thein vitro perspective and answer the following question: Which repurposing compounds have a regulatory effect on autophagy? In a subsequent step, one could determine where the compound-specific targets (secondary targets) are located in the graph. These targets could be in a relationship with autophagy itself or affect a process or another protein target that are elements of the autophagic process. This information can be used to hypothesize potential mechanisms of action in the autophagy context, which in turn could be tested via appropriate in vitro assays. In theory, the HBP could provide possible explanations for how compounds work in the autophagy context. In summary, our network and the associated hybrid workflow offer a wide range of opportunities to answer open questions in the search for appropriate approaches to new therapeutic treatments, extending beyond the context of AD."

Derivatives of benzylidine barbituric acid are the important
class of heterocyclic compound. Though they are originated
from barbituric acid, which is actually pharmaceutically inactive
one but its derivatives were practically verified drug moiety
[1-3]. On the account of this pharmacological potential, they
are widely used in variety of disease treatment. Apart from this
application, they found as intermediates in organic synthesis
[4] and the synthesis of other bioactive molecules like pigment,
vitamin B
12, etc. [5,6]. With all these applications barbituric
acid derivatives attract much attention of researchers. However,
the reported methods of synthesis have encountered some
limitations, such as long time to complete reaction, reduced
yields, extreme reaction conditions, the requirement of high
price catalysts and needs special kind of apparatus. So, to over-
come the stated restrictions, the finding of an altered and profi-
cient process for the production of 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-
barbituric acid derivatives is of foremost concern.
In the past decade, green synthesis of nanoparticles has
evolved as an important branch of nanotechnology because
of its potential application in the biomedical, magnetics, energy
science and aerospace industries [7]. Due to Lewis acid nature
of gold, it has gained tremendous attention in organic synthesis
[8]. The nanosized gold particles shows excellent catalytic

A convenient and efficient synthesis of 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-
barbituric acid derivatives via gold nanoparticles is carried out. The
gold nanoparticles were initiated from novel and low-cost goldsmith
effluent source using green reducing agent D-glucose. By mediating
autoclave at 121 ºC and 15 lb/cm

Numerous studies have reported the synthesis protocols
for AuNPs [16-20], out of those physical method microwave-
based synthesis was one of the recent approaches for green
synthesis [21,22]. In synthesis and assembly strategies of
nanoparticles, precursors from liquids, solids or gas phase are
used applying physical and chemical deposition approach [23].
The green synthesis of gold nanoparticles involves three main
steps viz. selection of solvent medium, selection of environ-
mental benign reducing agent and selection of the non-toxic
substances [24,25].
Alzheimer’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)
and Parkinson’s disease are common form of dementia. These
dementias considered under tauopathy; it is a neurodegenera-
tive diseases class caused by misfolding of the TAU protein. It
is estimated that more than 45 million people worldwide are
living with dementia and this number is expected to increase
to more than 130 million people by 2050 [26]. Consequently,
understanding the physiological and pathological roles of tau
in health and disease is important to identify new therapeutic
targets
In present study, 1,3-dimethyl benzilydene barbituric acid
derivatives were synthesized by using green and cost-effective
gold nanoparticles fabricated from gold smith effluent as a
low-cost and abundant source using autoclave microwave
composite treatment to get uniform distribution of nanoparticles.
D-glucose is used as the reducing reagent and starch as the
capping reagent for gold nanoparticles synthesis. Furthermore,
we checked the molecular docking study of barbituric acid
derivative against TAU protein as an anti-alzheimer drug target.

Gold smith effluent, starch, D-glucose, aromatic aldehyde
and 1,3-dimethyl barbituric acid were procured commerically
and used as such.
General procedure for synthesis of gold nanoparticles
Optimization of autoclave treatment time for gold
nanoparticles synthesis: A 2% starch (Himedia) solution (50
mL) was prepared in double distilled water. D-glucose
(Himedia, 1 mM) and 250 mL goldsmith effluent collected
from local goldsmith shop outlet was added. This solution was
autoclaved at 15 lb/inch
2 pressure for 10, 15 and 20 min and
analyzed by UV spectroscopy. After cooling, solution pH was
made to alkaline by using 1 mM NaOH.
Optimization of microwave treatment cycles for gold
nanoparticles synthesis: Microwave radiation treatment for
autoclaved solution was given at 2450 MHz, frequency in
domestic microwave oven (LG make) in cycles. Each cycle
consists of 15 s exposure to microwave irradiation followed
by cooling time interval of 15 s. Maximum 15 cycles had given.
Resulting solution was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 20 min.
Pellet was washed with distilled water and then by 70% ethanol
three times.
Characterization of gold nanoparticles:  Harvested
particles were dried at room temperature and made into fine
powder. This powder was dissolved in distilled water and anal-
yzed on the UV spectrophotometer (ELICO) from 400 to 750
nm range. Same powder was analyzed by using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM).
General procedure for preparation of 1,3-dimethyl-5-
(benzylidene)barbituric acid:  A mixture of aromatic
aldehyde (1 mmol), 1,3-dimethyl barbituric acid (1 mmol) and
catalyst gold nanoparticle (AuNP) (0.4 mol%) was stirred for
appropriate time. The progress and completion of reaction was
checked and monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction,
the mixture was cooled to room temperature. The mixture was
poured in cold water. The solid separated was filtered by suction
to afford crude product. Pure product was obtained by further
crystallization from ethanol to get the desired compound in
pure form (Scheme-I). The structure of all the products was
confirmed by physical and spectroscopic data.

General procedure for the molecular docking study:
Receptor preparation -TAU as a receptor was prepared using
AUTODOCK 4.2 tools. The Autodock tools package version
1.4.6 was used to generate the docking input files. Co-
crystallized ligand molecule was removed from the enzyme
active site. Binding site was detected from PDB pocket finder.
For the docking, a grid spacing of 0.375 Å and 75 × 69 × 76
number of points was used. Before docking all water molecules

of hydrogen atoms to receptor and merging non-polar
hydrogen. Receptor protein was assigned by Kollman united
atom charges and solvation parameters while ligands were
assigned by Gasteiger charge. Rigid roots were also assigned
to the ligand and five bonds were made rotatable.
Ligand preparation:  All the synthesized compounds
5-arylidine barbiturate were taken for prediction of 3D struc-
tures by using Cambridge software. The energy minimization
was done by using open babel in Pyrx virtual screening tool
with UFF force field and conjugate gradient optimization
algorithm. Receptor grid generation was done by Autodock
4.2. In the receptor grid generation, the receptor structure was
defined by excluding co-crystallized ligand, which confirmed
the position and size of the active site represented by receptor
grids.
Docking simulation: Docking simulation was done using
Autodock-Vina suite as molecular-docking tool. The default
optimization parameters were used with the Lamarckian Genetic
Algorithm with a population size of 150 dockings. A default
protocol were applied with mutation rate of 0.02 and a cross-
over rate of 0.8. The grid box used for specifying the search
space was set at 75 × 60 × 75 centered on of TAU with a default
grid point spacing of 0.375 Å. Auto Grid was used to obtain
pre-calculated grid maps. After completion of docking, most
suitable conformation was chosen based on lowest docked
energy.

Goldsmith effluent as a source of green synthesis of gold
nanoparticles was used. In alkaline condition, glucose oxidizes
itself by reducing gold solution in water. This reaction was
performed in autoclave at 15 lb/inch pressure for 15 min at
121 ºC. Comparative gold nanoparticle synthesis was analyzed
by observing the absorbance at 523 nm. Fig. 1 shows gold nano-
particles synthesis at various time duration. Increase in auto-

After the successful synthesis of gold nanoparticles, we
have proposed its application as a catalyst in Knoevenagel
condensation reaction of 1,3-dimethyl barbituric acid, which
having active methylene group with aromatic aldehyde that
produce 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-barbituric acid. Owing
to improve yield of resulted product of model reaction (Table-
1). We optimized different reaction parameters like tempe-
rature, solvent and amount of catalyst. After evaluating efficiency
of catalyst, we have also monitored the amount of catalyst in
order to get maximum yield. Use of 0.4 mol % of catalyst gave
high yield with less time. Selection of solvent and temperature
is also important parameters of reaction. Where we have been
found methanol was best solvent with respect to yield and
reaction time and 100 ºC offer best results for the model reaction.
With this optimized reaction conditions further, we have synthe-
sized wide range of derivatives of 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-
barbituric acid using structurally diverse aromatic aldehydes
(Table-2).

mations were analyzed using Pymol and Discovery Studio
softwares. All derivatives showed better binding affinity than
existing reference octopamine (Table-3). Compound 3f mole-
cule showed highest binding affinity with lowest energy -8.7
kcal/mol and compound 3b showed lowest binding affinity
with energy -6.9 kcal/mol. ADME analysis was performed
using Swiss ADME tool. ADME study predict that compounds
3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f and 3g molecules will pass through central
nervous system as all are not substrate of P-glycoprotein. It
further predicts 3b, 3c and 3d will pass through blood brain
barrier, but 3d molecule shows highest binding affinity with
lowest energy -8.3 kcal/mol (Fig. 4). All the molecules showed
maximum 55%, oral bioavailability, chemical stability at acidic
pH less than 2, have good passive absorption (> 70%) against
intestinal barrier with 100% passive absorption with trans-
cellular route. Molecular descriptor studies revealed that all
selected ligands were passed and acted as hydrophilic or mode-
rately hydrophobic basic drug molecule by their adherence to
the properties.

The reaction was conducted under mild conditions with a high yield of 92%. AuNPs showed reusability up to three cycles. Docking studies revealed that the synthesized barbiturate derivative (3d) could interact effectively with tau protein, potentially as a drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

Though they are originated from barbituric acid, which is actually pharmaceutically inactive one but its derivatives were practically verified drug moiety [1-3]. On the account of this pharmacological potential, they are widely used in variety of disease treatment. Apart from this application, they found as intermediates in organic synthesis [4] and the synthesis of other bioactive molecules like pigment, vitamin B12, etc. [5,6]. With all these applications barbituric acid derivatives attract much attention of researchers. However, the reported methods of synthesis have encountered some limitations, such as long time to complete reaction, reduced yields, extreme reaction conditions, the requirement of high price catalysts and needs special kind of apparatus. So, to overcome the stated restrictions, the finding of an altered and proficient process for the production of 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-barbituric acid derivatives is of foremost concern. In the past decade, green synthesis of nanoparticles has evolved as an important branch of nanotechnology because of its potential application in the biomedical, magnetics, energy science and aerospace industries [7]. Due to Lewis acid nature of gold, it has gained tremendous attention in organic synthesis [8]. The nanosized gold particles shows excellent catalytic activity than its bulk structure [9,10]. Gold nanoparticles has found significant catalyst in nearly all organic reactions, particularly benzannulation [11], oxidation reaction [12], reduction of aromatic amine [13], C-C Ullman coupling reaction [14], Biginelli reaction [15], etc. Numerous studies have reported the synthesis protocols for AuNPs [16-20], out of those physical method microwave-based synthesis was one of the recent approaches for green synthesis [21,22]. In synthesis and assembly strategies of nanoparticles, precursors from liquids, solids or gas phase are used applying physical and chemical deposition approach [23]. The green synthesis of gold nanoparticles involves three main steps viz. selection of solvent medium, selection of environmental benign reducing agent and selection of the non-toxic substances [24,25]. Alzheimer’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Parkinson’s disease are common form of dementia. These dementias considered under tauopathy; it is a neurodegenerative diseases class caused by misfolding of the TAU protein. It is estimated that more than 45 million people worldwide are living with dementia and this number is expected to increase to more than 130 million people by 2050 [26]. Consequently, understanding the physiological and pathological roles of tau in health and disease is important to identify new therapeutic targets In present study, 1,3-dimethyl benzilydene barbituric acid derivatives were synthesized by using green and cost-effective gold nanoparticles fabricated from gold smith effluent as a low-cost and abundant source using autoclave microwave composite treatment to get uniform distribution of nanoparticles. D-glucose is used as the reducing reagent and starch as the capping reagent for gold nanoparticles synthesis. Furthermore, we checked the molecular docking study of barbituric acid derivative against TAU protein as an anti-alzheimer drug target.","Goldsmith effluent as a source of green synthesis of gold nanoparticles was used. In alkaline condition, glucose oxidizes itself by reducing gold solution in water. This reaction was performed in autoclave at 15 lb/inch pressure for 15 min at 121 ºC. Comparative gold nanoparticle synthesis was analyzed by observing the absorbance at 523 nm. Fig. 1 shows gold nanoparticles synthesis at various time duration. Increase in autoclave treatment time showed increase in absorbance at 523 nm. Maximum absorbance is observed at 15 min autoclave treatment time. Further increase in autoclave treatment time did not show significant increase in absorbance. SEM images confirmed the synthesis of nanoparticles (Fig. 2). After the successful synthesis of gold nanoparticles, we have proposed its application as a catalyst in Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 1,3-dimethyl barbituric acid, which having active methylene group with aromatic aldehyde that produce 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-barbituric acid. Owing to improve yield of resulted product of model reaction (Table-1). We optimized different reaction parameters like temperature, solvent and amount of catalyst. After evaluating efficiency of catalyst, we have also monitored the amount of catalyst in order to get maximum yield. Use of 0.4 mol % of catalyst gave high yield with less time. Selection of solvent and temperature is also important parameters of reaction. Where we have been found methanol was best solvent with respect to yield and reaction time and 100 ºC offer best results for the model reaction. With this optimized reaction conditions further, we have synthesized wide range of derivatives of 1,3-dimethyl-5-benzylidene-barbituric acid using structurally diverse aromatic aldehydes (Table-2). The recovery and reusability are major advantages of gold nanopaticles as heterogeneous catalyst after taking part in reaction. The catalyst was employed in reaction, washed with acetone and kept in the oven at 80 ºC. This regenerated activating catalyst results similar yield up to 4th cycle, which proved there is no further loss in its catalytic activity (Fig. 3). Molecular docking studies: Docking protocol was verified by docking with reference molecule donepezil in the vicinity of the same active site of TAU protein. Selected conformations were analyzed using Pymol and Discovery Studio softwares. All derivatives showed better binding affinity than existing reference octopamine (Table-3). Compound 3f molecule showed highest binding affinity with lowest energy -8.7 kcal/mol and compound 3b showed lowest binding affinity with energy -6.9 kcal/mol. ADME analysis was performed using Swiss ADME tool. ADME study predict that compounds 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f and 3g molecules will pass through central nervous system as all are not substrate of P-glycoprotein. It further predicts 3b, 3c and 3d will pass through blood brain barrier, but 3d molecule shows highest binding affinity with lowest energy -8.3 kcal/mol (Fig. 4). All the molecules showed maximum 55%, oral bioavailability, chemical stability at acidic pH less than 2, have good passive absorption (> 70%) against intestinal barrier with 100% passive absorption with trans-cellular route. Molecular descriptor studies revealed that all selected ligands were passed and acted as hydrophilic or moderately hydrophobic basic drug molecule by their adherence to the properties."

ABSTRACT  
 
Over the past few years research on Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) has been grown experimentally 
which is a neurodegenerative disease and the 
most common form of dementia that cause 
memory loss and affect the ability to think 
which can interfere with daily life. The main 
cause of AD is on the growth of plagues and 
tangles. AD is most commonly found in the age 
of 60s, starts with mild memory loss and other 
disabilities which lead the person t o forget 
things on their daily life. In our research we are 
trying to ide ntify potential natural based 
bioactive drug source compound using advanced 
computational biology to help in exploring clues 
for the treatment of AD patients using molecular 
docking method. BACE1 was screened as a 
potential target receptor in our study for the 
disease research. We also observed chromen -4-
one as potent bioactive compound p resenting 
high docking score of -5.60 K cal/mol against 
BACE1 followed by other compounds. This 
identification will open new scope to future 
researchers to explor e more bioa ctive 
compounds which may aid new treatment 
options against AD followed with wet lab 
experimentation.

INTRODUCTION  
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a most common 
disease, predominately found in elder age 
group, which is a form of dementia caused 
by plaques and tangles. AD is considered as 
neurodegenerative disease that cause 
degeneration or loss of neurons in the brain 
and get sh runk. It is a serious problem 
which affects the ability to  remember, 
imagine or learn. Nowadays every third 
person is facing this AD problems, which 
resulted our research objective to explore  
more on this disease, its type , causes, 
treatment and precau tions. It depends on 
two factors, plaques (abnormal clusters of 
protein fragments) and tangles (made up of 
twisted strands of another p rotein). In a bi - Anupriya et.al. Genomics and drug research approach in identifying potential drug target highlighting

lipid cell membrane APP (Amyloid 
Precursor Protein) is present which helps in 
the growth and repair of neuro n. APP is a 
single-pass transmembrane protein 
expressed at  high levels in the brain and 
metabolized in a rapid and highly complex 
manner by a series of sequential proteases, 
including the intramembranous γ -secretase 
complex, which process other key 
regulatory molecules. 
Half part of APP protein is inside the ce ll 
and half of it is present outside of the cell. 
Alpha secretase is a type of enzyme which 
cuts the APP pro tein at some pa rticular 
points.[1] There is another enzyme known as 
gamma secretase which is also used to 
divide the APP protein into two parts. These 
sections were cut by the alpha and gamma 
secretase enzyme which are soluble in water 
that causes APP protein to be dissolved and 
new APP protein can be developed but 
when stimulation of beta secretase takes 
place it cannot be dissolved in water due to 
side cut which form s plaque. This plaque 
can obstruc t the signals between neurons 
which produce inflammation leads to 
degeneration of neurons.  
Tau protein can be found in neurons and one 
of its key roles is to support the microtubule 
highway system.  In AD, tau proteins 
changes and become abnormally 
hyperphosphorylated which stop supporting 
microtubules. Instead, the tau protein binds 
with other tau proteins, forming long protein 
threads within the neuron. T hese threads 
become protein tangles and interfere with 
the neuron’s ability to function. The 
proteolysis of APP protein b y β - and γ -
secretase activities [2] also incur with past 
research with identification of APP-cleaving 
enzyme 1 (BACE1) which is the major β - 
secretase responsible for plaq ue formation 
in the brain. [3-6] BACE1 is present in most 
of body tissues including bra in highlighted 
it as important enzyme protein used as a 
biomarker for AD.[7-9] 
With current advancement in bioinformatics 
and drug discovery research has opened new 
areas for exploring the treatment of AD with 
the help of system biology. In this research, 
we discovered target receptor BACE1 as 
potential drug target fo r AD , it inhibits Aβ 
production.[10] Bioactive compounds were 
extracted from plants which act as potent 
herbal medicine and helps to form a 
complex which can be used a s drug for the 
treatment of AD. Further, docking studies 
were carried out in which BACE1 is be st 
docked with chromen -4-one followed by 
some other bioactive compounds with 
positive potential result. To cross validate 
our docking research hypothesis we 
conducted computational based molecular 
dynamic (MD) simulation analysis to find 
potential drug compounds for futurist 
research. 
 
MATERIALS & METHOD 
Collection of data 
The protein samples were selected on the 
basis of extensive bibl iographic research 
literature resulting in identification of 
certain proteins that can play a vital role in 
target predic tion which will help in the 
identification of treatment process in 
Alzheimer’s disease. Target protein or 
receptor sequence was  further extracte d 
from universal public domain U niprot 
database. 
 
Homology modeling and physiological 
characteristics 
The target protein sequence was exported to 
Swiss model server  for homology 
modeling,[11] to determine the 3-dimensional 
structure. Further, the analysis of the 
physiochemical properties of target receptor 
were evaluated using Protparam tool for 
finding no. of amino  acid, molecular weight 
and theoretical PI and GRAVY value. [12] 
With the help of SOPMA server secondary 
structure of target receptor was predi cted.[13] 
Transmembrane properties study were  
carried out by SOSUI server [14] and 
Ramachandran plot was created by 
Procheck server.[15]  
 
Receptor preparation 
The pro tein file s extracted from Swiss 
model were forwarded for receptor  Anupriya et.al. Genomics and drug research approach in identifying potential drug target highlighting

preparation using UCSF Chimera .[16] 
Receptor preparation with Chimera was 
preceded further with the removal of 
residues such as ions, liga nds and solvents 
from protein, for the next step SPDBV is 
used to carry the energy minimization of the 
protein. Finally, in receptor preparation 
pipeline chimera is again used to add 
hydrogen and charge to the protein then 
surface binding analysi s is done and save 
the file as final receptor in default .pdb 
format. 
 
Ligand Preparation 
Extensive research literature study 
suggested us to explore various bioactive 
compounds that are present in environment 
as plants and herbs which are useful in the 
treatment of  Alzheimer disease. We 
screened and downloaded  various 
compounds from PUBCHEM [17] which 
leads into the library preparation. With the 
help of OSIRIS and DruLito software, we 
screened ADMET properties of bio active 
compounds. OSIRIS Property Explor er 
helps to design the  chemical structures and 
calculates on -the-fly numerous drug -
relevant characteristics to be reasonable for 
a candidate drug. Prediction results are 
valued and color coded. Properties with 
high prospects of unwanted results like 
mutagenicity or a poor intestinal immersion 
are shown in red whereas green color 
indicates drug - behavior.[18] DruoLito 
(Drug-likeness tools) rules are set of 
guidelines for the structural properties of 
compounds, used for fast calculation of 
drug-like properties of a molecule. These 
guidelines are not absolute, nor are th ey 
intended to form strict cutoff values for 
which property values are drug -like and 
which are not drug -like. Nevertheless, they 
can be quite effective and efficient.  
 
Molecular docking 
Molecular docking is a key tool in structural 
molecular biology and computer -assisted 
drug design. The goal of ligand -protein 
docking is to forecast the foremost binding 
mode(s) of a ligand with a protein of known 
three-dimensional structure. Docking can be 
used to perform virtual screening o n large 
libraries of compounds. [19] The receptor 
BACE1 with target ligands were further 
subjected for docking studies in 
CHIMERA-Auto dock Vina. The docking 
studies states that the docked complex 
convey a high negative binding energy score 
ΔG which specify the concept of minimum 
energy and high security leading to best 
inter connection between  proteins and the 
ligands. The obtained ligand -receptor 
docked complex was  further predicted in 
Biovia Discovery studio to explain docking 
analysis b etween the bonds of ligands and 
receptors. 
 
MD simulations 
We use molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation to computationally validate  our 
analysis using iMOD server [20]. It is a 
computer program that stimulates the 
atomic behaviour of molecules. 
 
RESULTS 
Physiochemical property analysis of 
receptor 
The analysis of the target receptor was 
selected on the bas is of their GRAVY value 
in the P rotParam tool, BACE1 receptor was 
finally selected for target protein receptor 
study having GRAVY -0.064 shown in 
Table 1. With the help of SOSUI online tool 
amino acid sequences of the selected 
receptor BACE1 can help in the prognosis 
of the portion of secondary structure of 
protein shown in Figure 1. SOPMA is a tool 
to predict the secondary structure of protein 
which is b ased on the homologue methods 
for sequencing. The graph shows expected 
score curve and different patterns of coils, 
helix, sheet and turn shown in F igure 2 and 
Table 2 . It also displays parameter like 
window width and the number states. The 
BACE1 sequence was  also prepared for 
homology modeling study resulted in the 
generation of pdb structure for receptor 
design and docking studies as shown in

using AutoDock vina. Further, we evaluate 
the docking of these ligands with the 
selected receptor BACE1 and produced 
different docking scores; among these 
dockings we selected best five bioactive 
compounds or ligands. The ligands were 
selected with the parameters of higher the

DISCUSSION 
AD is a progressive disease that destroys 
memories and other important cognitive 
functions. In our research we collected 
information of different properties of 
several bioactive natural compounds by 
using different web servers like SO PMA, 
SOSUI, DruLito, Prochecker [21], OSIRIS [22] 
and concluded that BACE1 act as a 
potential receptor that plays an important 
role in curing  AD[23]. BACE1 inhibition 
together with other strategies , including 
immunotherapy which is designed  to clear 
brain amyloid plaques or neurofibri llary 
tangles, is likely to be more effective in 
improving cognition in AD.  
BACE1 receptor is essential for the 
generation of all monomeric forms of 
amyloid-β. BACE1 initiates production of 
β-amyloid peptides (Aβ), which is 
connected with reasonable disorder in 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to unusual 
oligomerization and accumulation.[23] In our 
study BACE1 receptor was finally selected 
for target protein receptor study having 
hydrophobic property with GRAVY -0.064 
followed by secondary structure analysis. 
Similarly, various research studies on 
BACE 1 as a prime drug target for the 
remedial inhibition of Aβ production in AD. 
BACE1 inhibitors should offer benefit for 
AD patients and structural analysis of 
BACE1 inhibitor complexes has prov ed 
useful for drug development. [24] 
Various dataset contain various compounds 
with different physical and chemical 
properties covering an extensive ch emical 
space in drug like range. Screening of 
bioactive compounds such as P ubchem 
CID:16830 with ΔG -5.3 kcal/mol, P uchem 
CID:14546 with ΔG -5.3 kcal/mol and 
Pubchem CID: 16848 with ΔG -5.5 
kcal/mol docking scores, P ubchem 
CID:10286 with ΔG -5.6 kcal/m ol docking 
score and P ubchem CID:23879 with ΔG -
5.4 kcal/mol docking score show active 
potential candidate drug compound in AD 
treatment. Similar research studies show 
antioxidant and anti -inflammatory 
properties with natural bi oactive drug 
compound complex , Rasmarinic acid 
against CASP8 with a docking score of -8.0 
kcal/mol and PTPN11 against Carnosol with 
a docking score of -9.1 kcal/mol helps in the 
treatment of AD . [25]  Another, similar 
literatures shows variety of natural bioactive 
compounds having pure pharmacological 
moieties showing multitargeting activities  
and others exhibiting specific beta -site 
amyloid precursor protein -cleaving enzyme 
1 inhibition have superior biosafety . [26] 
Many of these compounds, which are 
isolated from medicinal herbs and marine 
flora, have been long used for the treatment. 
Thus, with the use of this potential bioactive 
compounds like chromen -4-one with 
positive MD simulation provide us new 
research perception to explore more 
bioactive compounds against AD treatment 
followed by wet lab validations. 
 
CONCLUSION 
Several studies proposed that BACE1 
inhibitor highlighted therapeutic potential 
for deceleration of long term progression of 
AD. In our study BACE1 protein was  Anupriya et.al. Genomics and drug research approach in identifying potential drug target highlighting

docking studies against screened potential 
natural bioactive compounds like chromen -

will explore more potential scope in 
exploring bioactive compounds against AD 
treatment and  its cure followed by wet -lab

researchers leading to effective new 
candidate drugs against AD.

******  ","The article discusses a genomics-based approach to identify potential drug targets for Alzheimer's disease, focusing on BACE1 as a key therapeutic target. It outlines the use of computational tools and techniques such as molecular docking, secondary structure prediction, and normal mode analysis to study the protein-protein interactions involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The research employs SWISS-MODEL for homology modeling, SOPMA and SOSUI for secondary structure prediction, and UCSF Chimera for visualization. PubChem is used to analyze bioactivities of small molecules. The study highlights the importance of natural compounds as potential therapeutic agents against BACE1 activity, supporting their role in drug discovery strategies for Alzheimer's disease.","Over the past few years research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been grown experimentally which is a neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of dementia that cause memory loss and affect the ability to think which can interfere with daily life. The main cause of AD is on the growth of plagues and tangles. AD is most commonly found in the age of 60s, starts with mild memory loss and other disabilities which lead the person to forget things on their daily life. In our research we are trying to identify potential natural based bioactive drug source compound using advanced computational biology to help in exploring clues for the treatment of AD patients using molecular docking method. BACE1 was screened as a potential target receptor in our study for the disease research. We also observed chromen-4-one as potent bioactive compound presenting high docking score of -5.60 K cal/mol against BACE1 followed by other compounds. This identification will open new scope to future researchers to explore more bioactive compounds which may aid new treatment options against AD followed with wet lab experimentation.","Alzheimer disease (AD) is a most common disease, predominately found in elder age group, which is a form of dementia caused by plaques and tangles. AD is considered as neurodegenerative disease that cause degeneration or loss of neurons in the brain and get shrunk. It is a serious problem which affects the ability to remember, imagine or learn. Nowadays every third person is facing this AD problems, which resulted our research objective to explore more on this disease, its type, causes, treatment and precautions. It depends on two factors, plaques (abnormal clusters of protein fragments) and tangles (made up of twisted strands of another protein). In a bi-lipid cell membrane APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) is present which helps in the growth and repair of neuron. APP is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the brain and metabolized in a rapid and highly complex manner by a series of sequential proteases, including the intramembranous γ-secretase complex, which process other key regulatory molecules. Half part of APP protein is inside the cell and half of it is present outside of the cell. Alpha secretase is a type of enzyme which cuts the APP protein at some particular points.[1] There is another enzyme known as gamma secretase which is also used to divide the APP protein into two parts. These sections were cut by the alpha and gamma secretase enzyme which are soluble in water that causes APP protein to be dissolved and new APP protein can be developed but when stimulation of beta secretase takes place it cannot be dissolved in water due to side cut which forms plaque. This plaque can obstruct the signals between neurons which produce inflammation leads to degeneration of neurons. Tau protein can be found in neurons and one of its key roles is to support the microtubule highway system. In AD, tau proteins changes and become abnormally hyperphosphorylated which stop supporting microtubules. Instead, the tau protein binds with other tau proteins, forming long protein threads within the neuron. These threads become protein tangles and interfere with the neuron’s ability to function. The proteolysis of APP protein by β- and γ-secretase activities [2] also incur with past research with identification of APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) which is the major β-secretase responsible for plaque formation in the brain. [3-6] BACE1 is present in most of body tissues including brain highlighted it as important enzyme protein used as a biomarker for AD.[7-9] With current advancement in bioinformatics and drug discovery research has opened new areas for exploring the treatment of AD with the help of system biology. In this research, we discovered target receptor BACE1 as potential drug target for AD, it inhibits Aβ production.[10] Bioactive compounds were extracted from plants which act as potent herbal medicine and helps to form a complex which can be used as drug for the treatment of AD. Further, docking studies were carried out in which BACE1 is best docked with chromen-4-one followed by some other bioactive compounds with positive potential result. To cross validate our docking research hypothesis we conducted computational based molecular dynamic (MD) simulation analysis to find potential drug compounds for futurist research.","Physiochemical property analysis of receptor The analysis of the target receptor was selected on the basis of their GRAVY value in the ProtParam tool, BACE1 receptor was finally selected for target protein receptor study having GRAVY -0.064 shown in Table 1. With the help of SOSUI online tool amino acid sequences of the selected receptor BACE1 can help in the prognosis of the portion of secondary structure of protein shown in Figure 1. SOPMA is a tool to predict the secondary structure of protein which is based on the homologue methods for sequencing. The graph shows expected score curve and different patterns of coils, helix, sheet and turn shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. It also displays parameter like window width and the number states. The BACE1 sequence was also prepared for homology modeling study resulted in the generation of pdb structure for receptor design and docking studies as shown in Figure 3. Screening of ligands For our research analysis we extracted total 400 bioactive compounds which are Caffeic, Ferulic acid, Gallotannins, Procyanidins, Rhamentin, Acetylcholine, Bilobetin, Carotenoids, Donepeziel, Hydroxyethul starch, Isorhamnetin, L.Rhamnose, L.Glutamate, Luteolin, Memantine, Rivastigmine, Tacrine, Tamarixetin, Terpenoid etc. through Pubchem database. Moreover, OSIRIS and DruLito resulted in screening of the drug likeness and prepare libraries of these bioactive compounds. Finally, 20 bioactive compounds were extracted as ligands for molecular docking using AutoDock vina. Further, we evaluate the docking of these ligands with the selected receptor BACE1 and produced different docking scores; among these dockings we selected best five bioactive compounds or ligands. The ligands were selected with the parameters of higher the negative score which is directly proportional to high binding efficiency. Moreover, we use Pubchem to cross-check the chemical information of these five selected bioactive compounds such as Pubchem CID:16830 with ΔG -5.3 kcal/mol, Puchem CID:14546 with ΔG -5.3 kcal/mol and Pubchem CID: 16848 with ΔG -5.5 kcal/mol docking scores are the isomers of ferulic acid, Pubchem CID:10286 with ΔG -5.6 kcal/mol docking score is the isomers of rhamentin and Pubchem CID:23879 with ΔG -5.4 kcal/mol docking score is the isomers of caffeic shown in Table3 and Figure 4-8). The best docking score having Pubchem CID 10286 with ΔG -5.6 Kcal/mol docking score was selected for further analysis by using iMOD server. The result obtained were graphs based on deformability, bfactor, atom index etc. The eigenvalue of Pubchem CID 10286 is 5.223176e -04 as shown in Figure 9-10."

Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is a critical enzyme involved in cellula r stress responses and neuroprot ection, making it a significant 
target in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Dysregulati on of Sirt1 contributes to amyloid-beta accumulation, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation—hallmarks of AD pathology. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to 
develop small molecules that enhance Si rt1 activity, offering a novel therapeutic approach. By targeting Sirt1, these 
molecules can potentially mitigate AD progre ssion, providing a promising strategy fo r developing effective treatments. In 
this present work, a pharmacophor e containing six features has been design ed using the Sirt1 m acromolecule crystal 
structure using the Discovery Studio 2.0 software and validated by the Gune ry-Henery (GH) Scoring method. The GH 
scores have been found in the acceptable range. Further, validated pharmacophores have been used for exploring the plant-
derived database to retrieve the novel hits employing various parameters viz fit value, Lipinski rule of five violation, feature 
mapping, in silico pharmacokinetics and toxicological studies. After the virtual screening process, 24-24 molecules from the 
ZINC and FDA-approved database have been retrieved which have been further subjected to molecular docking to 
determine the binding interactio ns with the Sirt1 enzyme's active binding sites using the LibDock module in DS 2.0 
software. Based on binding energy and binding interactions  2-2 molecules from the ZINC database and FDA-approved 
database have been selected for the mo lecular dynamic simulation. The knowledge obtained in this study may help reveal 
commercially available compounds that can become potent activators of Sirt1.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating 
neurodegenerative disorder characterised by 
progressive cognitive decline, memory impairment, 
and behavioural changes
1,2. It is marked by the 
pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta (A β) 
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain
3. Despite 
extensive research, there is  still no cure for AD, and 
current treatments only offer limited symptomatic 
relief. Consequently, there is a pressing need for 
novel therapeutic approaches to address the disease's 
underlying causes and halt its progression
4,5. Sirtuin1 
(SIRT1) is a member of the Sirtuin family of NAD+-
dependent deacetylases and has garnered significant 
attention due to its involvement in regulating various 
cellular processes, including ageing, metabolism, and 
stress responses
6. In the context of neurodegeneration, 
SIRT1 is particularly noteworthy for its potential 
neuroprotective effects
7. SIRT1 exerts its beneficial 
effects by deacetylating and modulating the activity of 
several key proteins and transcription factors involved 
in neuronal survival, inflammation, and metabolic 
regulation. These properties make SIRT1 an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention in AD
8. 
Research has demonstrated that SIRT1 activation 
can positively influence several pathological 
processes associated with AD 9. For instance, SIRT1 
activation has been shown to reduce the production of 
Aβ peptides, one of the primary culprits in AD 
pathology10. This is achieved through the 
deacetylation and activation of retinoic acid receptor 
beta (RAR β), which subsequently increases the 
expression of ADAM10, an enzyme that promotes the 
non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor

protein (APP) 11. Additionally, SIRT1 can modulate 
tau pathology by deacetylating and stabilizing 
microtubules, thus reducing tau hyperphosphorylation 
and aggregation. These findings suggest that SIRT1 
activation could mitigate key pathological features of 
AD and confer neuroprotection
11. 
Structure-based drug design (SBDD) is a powerful 
strategy in modern medicinal chemistry that involves 
designing molecules with specific interactions based 
on the three-dimensional structure of a target 
protein
12. The resolved crystal structure of SIRT1 
provides critical insights into its active site and 
binding pockets, facilitating the design of small 
molecules that can specifically bind to and modulate 
SIRT1 activity
13. This rational approach allows for the 
identification and optimization of compounds that 
enhance SIRT1 activity, offering a promising pathway 
for developing new therapeutic agents for AD. 
In the SBDD process, computational techniques 
such as molecular docking and virtual screening are 
employed to identify potential SIRT1 activators from 
extensive libraries of compounds
13. These initial hits 
are then subject to medicinal chemistry efforts to 
optimize their binding affinity, specificity, and 
pharmacokinetic properties. The goal is to create 
molecules that are not only potent SIRT1 activators 
but also possess favourable characteristics for brain 
delivery and stability. 
We intended to find novel modulators using online 
available databases as prospective therapies targeted 
to SIRT1 in AD based on the views discussed above. 
By using the sirt1 structural protein with 
nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD) interaction 
as a template structure, we conducted in silico 
research that considered the construction of a 
receptor-based pharmacophore model for virtual 
screening. Following using the created 
pharmacophore model to virtually screen from the 
database, the obtained compounds were further 
filtered for their drug-likeness using Lipinski's 
Veber's and ADMET filters. An investigation was 
conducted to determine th e binding relationship 
between the drug-like compounds that were obtained 
and the sirt1 structural protein with NAD domain 
pocket residues. In addition, the compounds that were 
acquired from docking research with the tubulin 
structural protein were put through significant 
molecular dynamics (MD) si mulations to determine 
whether or not they remained stable for a period of 
fifty nanoseconds. In addition, the compounds that 
exhibited binding interactions with critical residues of 
the tubulin structural protein, which were comparable 
to those shown in the crystallographic structure of the 
sirt1 structural protein –NAD, were docked with the 
mutant structure that was produced. 
 
Material and methodology 
 
Development of structure-based pharmacophore 
Finding the precise location of the catalytic 
interaction between the protein and its bound  
co-crystallized ligand is accomplished using the 
structure-based pharmacophore model. The essential 
pharmacophoric properties that hinder protein activity 
may be identified by analysing this model's data.  
A structure-based pharmacophore was created  
using the 3D structure of sirt1 (4i4i) and its  
co-crystallized modulator NAD. Discovery Studio  
2.0 was used to build six structure-based 
pharmacophore characteristics. HBA, HY, HBD, and 
aromatic rings were these properties
14. 
 
Validation of Receptor-Ligand Pharmacophore 
Model 
The Guner-Henry (GH) technique, also known as 
the decoy set validation method, is used in 
computational chemistry and cheminformatics to 
evaluate the developed pharmacophore model 
robustness
15. This technique involves the following 
steps:

Virtual Screening 
There are 1,64,919 compounds in the Zinc and 
1,168 in FDA FDA-approved database were 
downloaded. The verified pharmacophore was used as 
a 3D query using the ligand Pharmacophore Mapping 
module in Discovery Studio 2.0 to identify chemicals 
that potentially affect Sirt1. Additionally, the possible 
compounds were sorted by feature mapping, fit value, 
and the Lipinski rule of five. Using the pkCSM web 
tool, the discovered chemicals underwent a further

further refine the mixture. Following the filtering 
procedure, the drug-like compounds were extracted 
and subjected to molecular docking with the sirt1 
macromolecule
16. 
 
Molecular Docking of Drug-Like Compounds with 
Sirt1 
Molecular docking was used to build bioactive 
binding poses within the Sirt1 protein enzyme's 
catalytic site from the drug-like chemicals obtained 
via filtering. The protein structure (4i5i) was retrieved 
from PDB. The protein structure was built using 
SWISPDB viewer and used to determine binding 
score and chemical binding interactions using the 
Pyrx virtual screening tool and Autodock Vina 
module. Pymol and Discovery Studio Visualizer 
analysed protein-ligand binding
17. 
 
Molecular dynamic simulation 
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a 
computational technique used to study the physical 
movements of atoms and molecules over time, 
providing insights into molecular structure and 
behaviour (The Desmond 2020.1 from Schrödinger, 
LLC). This process begins with the selection and 
preparation of the molecular system, including the 
choice of an appropriate force field to define the 
potential energy. The system is then solvated, 
typically in a water box, and ionized to mimic 
physiological conditions. Energy minimization is 
performed to remove any steric clashes, followed by 
equilibration under controlled temperature and 
pressure conditions. During the production run (100 
ns), Newton’s equations of motion are integrated over 
time to simulate atom movements, with trajectories 
recorded for subsequent analysis. Post-simulation, the 
trajectory data is analysed to assess molecular 
properties such as stability, conformational changes, 
and interactions, often visualized using specialized 
software. Advanced analyses may further refine the 
insights gained from the simulation
18. 
 
Result and Discussion 
 
Generation and validation of receptor-ligand pharmacophore 
model 
Using Discovery Studio 2.0 software, six feature 
pharmacophore were devel oped which included two 
hydrogen bond acceptors, two hydrophobic and two 
hydrogen donors as shown in Fig. 1. 
This six-feature-based pharmacophore was 
validated using the Gunery Henery scoring method. 
The database included 90 decoy compounds and 13 
inhibitors that were known to have sirt1. To assess the 
model's capability to differentiate between active and 
decoy compounds, the pharmacophore model was 
used as a 3D query to explore the internal decoy 
database. The following metrics were computed: total 
hits (Ht), active hits (Ha), percentage yield of actives, 
percentage ratio of actives, and GH score. A GH score 
between 0.7 - 0.8 implies a very commendable model. 
The observed value for the pharmacophore model was 
0.752, as seen in Table 1. The verified findings 
demonstrate that the model was very effective for 
database screening. 
 
Drug-like compounds retrieved from virtual 
screening 
A highly reliable pharmacophore was employed to 
explore the test compounds database and 1,64,919 
compounds from the Zinc database and 1,168 in the 
FDA-approved database were retrieved. Afterwards, 
using various filtration parameters including fit 
values, and feature mapping 167 and 1128 
compounds were separated respectively. In addition,

Ro5, veber's filters, and in silico pharmacokinetic and 
toxicological parameters also sorted the compounds 
(Table S1 and S2) and found 24-24 compounds from 
the ZINC and FDA-approved databases as shown in 
Table 2 and Table 3. 
 
Molecular docking 
Following the retrieval of compounds from the 
ZINC and FDA-approved databases, the molecular 
docking technique was used to investigate the binding 
interactions of the compounds that were recovered 
with the active binding sites of the Sirt1 enzyme 
domain. The efficiency of the AutoDock Vina 
technique was assessed before docking these 
compounds. This was accomplished by re-docking the 
co-crystallized ligand, NAD, into the Sirt1-binding 
pocket. Pyrx software was used for this evaluation. 
The purpose of this re-docking procedure is to act as a 
validation phase, which ensures that the docking 
algorithm properly repro duces the known binding 
mode of the co-crystallized ligand. This, in turn, 
confirms the dependability of the docking 
methodology for the following study of the flavonoid 
compounds. For this reason, we carried out docking 
of 24-24 compounds derived from ZINC  and  FDA-

approved databases to evaluate the manner in which 
these compounds interact with the particular residues 
that are located in the catalytic site of the Sirt1 
enzyme. All of the compounds that were retrieved 
were able to bind themselves to the Sirt1 enzyme with 
a high docking score, which was higher than the score 
for the reference compound. It was shown that these 
chemicals interact with the essential amino acid 
residues that are found in the Sirt1 protein. The amino 
acid residues Gln294, Phe297, Tyr280, His363, 
Gln345, Glu467, Asn465, Asp272, and Asp471 are 
shown in the Sirt1 crystal structure. For effective 
binding interactions, it is essential to have Phe273, 
Ala262, Ser441, Ser442, Arg466, Cys482, Phe414, 
Val266, and Arg274. The compounds that were 
recovered showed evidence of binding to the required 
amino acids, which indicates that they have the 
qualities needed to interact with the Sirt1 enzyme
19,20. 
This is supported by Table 4, Table 5, Fig. 2 and 
Fig. 3. 
 
Molecular dynamic simulation 
MD simulation is used to explore the binding 
stability of protein-ligand docking complexes. The 
MD simulation also provid es information regarding 
intermolecular interaction within a reference time. 
Herein, the complexes docking file of selected two 
NCI and two plant-based compounds with Sirt1 
protein were analysed by utilising MD simulation 
approaches to confirm the stability and intermolecular 
interactions between protein and molecules against 
100 ns time intervals
21. In MD modelling, RMSD was 
evaluated between the initial and final simulated 
trajectories, and crucial features including binding 
interactions and conforma tion characteristics of the 
complex were also evaluated. For the enzyme-ligand 
complex (4i5i) involving ZINC000000864920, 
ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide, the 
average RMSD values were found as 2.87, 3.08, 3.03 
and 3.10 Å respectively as shown in Fig. 4. These 
values suggest efficient binding of the ligands with 
the sirt1 enzyme
22,23. The lower RMSD values 
indicate a relatively stable and consistent binding of 
these ligands within the enzyme’s active site across 
the simulation time frame. 
Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), is an 
important feature that has to be considered when 
evaluating the structural flexibility of proteins during

MD. In addition to assisting in the evaluation of the 
influence that ligand binding has on the stability of 
proteins, it offers knowledge on the fluctuations of 
certain amino acid residues. For this investigation, we 
compute RMSF values to investigate the fluctuations 
that occur within the prot ein residues when they are 
attached to ligands. The protein's structural stability 
might be disrupted if the RMSF value is more  
than three angstroms, which indicates that there  
is a possibility   of   higher  amino  acid  fluctuations

following ligand binding. On the other hand, a value 
of RMSF that is less than three angstroms indicates 
that there are fewer variations in amino acids, which 
indicates that the protein is more stable and resistant 
to structural alterations. The values of the RMSF for 
the complexes that were chosen for this investigation 
varied from 0.4 to 3 Å, which indicates that there 
were moderate variations in the amino acid residues. 
In terms of the ligands that the protein bound, the 
average RMSF values were as follows: 1.78, 1.49, 
1.70, and 1.60 Å for ZINC000000864920, 
ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide 
correspondingly as shown in Fig. 5. Collectively, 
these RMSF values provide an indication of the 
complexes' stability as well as their flexibility while 
the MD simulations were being performed. 
Compound ZINC000000864920 showed hydrogen 
bonding interactions with Tyr280, Arg282, Asp286, 
Gln294, Glu315, Gln345 and Asp348, hydrophobic 
interactions with Asp286, Glu315, Gln320, Asn346 
and Asp348 amino acid residues with active binding 
active sites of sirt1 enzyme. Similarly, 
ZINC000096361333 showed hydrogen bonding 
interactions with Gly261, Ala262, Gly263, Ser266, 
Phe273, Tyr280, Gln294, Gln345, Asn346, His363, 
Phe414, Ser442 and Glu467; hydrophobic interactions 
with Arg274 and Lys444 amino acid residues of sirt1 
macromolecules as shown in Fig. 6. 
Interestingly, Folic acid compound showed 
hydrogen bond interactions with Ala262, Gly263, 
Val266, Ser267, Arg274, Asp292, Gln294, Gln345, 
Gly440, Ser441, Ser442, Leu443, Lys444, Asn465, 
Arg466, Asp481 and Cyt482 and Bicalutamide 
showed hydrogen bond inte ractions with Ala262, 
Gly263, Val266, Asp272, Phe273, Arg274, Tyr280, 
His363, Val412, Gly440 and Asn465 amino acid 
residues of sirt1 active binding sites. Folic acid and 
Bicalutamide compounds also formed hydrophobic 
interactions with Ala262, Phe273, Phe297 and 
Phe414 amino acid residues of sir1 enzyme active 
binding cavities as shown in Fig. 6. 
Moreover, to evaluate the protein complexes to 
solvent molecules and their structural stability, several 
surface area measurements, such as SASA and rGyr, 
were analysed. The results revealed that the SASA 
values for ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, 
Folic acid and Bicalutamide were 13282-14624 Å, 
13575-15578 Å, 13523-14792 Å, and 13271-14791 
Å, respectively. Additionally, the rGyr values 
for ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic 
acid and Bicalutamide were 20.09, 19.81, 19.9, and 
22.85 Å, respectively.

In the field of drug disco very research, the use of 
Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) techniques 
has resulted in the establishment of new standards for 
the identification of promising chemical compounds 
that target particular receptors. There is no denying 
the fact that CADD techniques make a major 
contribution to the improvement of the drug 
development pipeline. Through molecular docking, 
MM-GBSA calculations, and MD simu
lation
investigations, it has been shown that the four
co
mpounds that have been offered have a promising
affinity for Sirt1  20. At the same time, to  evaluate the
potential of these co
mpounds against sirt1, mu ltiple
experim
ental verifications must be ca rried out. An
efficient way to deter
mine whether or not th e
m
olecules have a strong affinity for one another is th e
Surface Plas
mon Resonance (SPR) test. A kinetic
study is an appropriate method to i nvestigate the
processes that are r esponsible for the binding and
unbinding of 
these molecules. Based on  the results of
the experim
ents, more optimization of the mo lecules
may
 be required to enhance their therap eutic potential
and m
aximize their effectiveness.
Conclusion 
This study
 targeted sirt1, which elevates the 
metabolism of amyloid-beta (A β) peptides, which are 
central to the pathology of AD. The research screened 
NCI and plant-based databases using an in silico 
structure-based pharmacophore model. LOR5, 
Weber’s filter, and fit value enhanced the screening 
procedure, giving 24 (ZINC database) and 24 (FDA-
approved database) lead compounds with better 
binding affinity than the co-crystalized modulator. 
A further refinement utilizing Prime/MM-GBSA 
simulations led to the discovery of seven molecules 
that had binding energies that were higher than those 
of the reference ligand. The sirt1 modulator potential 
and stability of the lead compounds were validated 
by the use of MD simulations, which demonstrated 
that the lead compounds showed stable binding 
interactions with the sirt1protein. There was a 
significant sirt1 protein affinity shown by four 
different compounds: ZINC000000864920, 
ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide.

In silico screening of NCI and plant-based databases using pharmacophore models, LOR5, Weber’s filter, and fit value led to identification of lead compounds with better binding affinity than the co-crystalized modulator. Prime/MM-GBSA simulations further refined these compounds to seven with higher binding energies. MD simulations validated Sirt1 protein stability and strong affinity by four compounds: ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic acid, and Bicalutamide. Experimental verification through SPR tests and kinetic studies is recommended to optimize therapeutic potential.","Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is a critical enzyme involved in cellular stress responses and neuroprotection, making it a significant target in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Dysregulation of Sirt1 contributes to amyloid-beta accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation—hallmarks of AD pathology. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to develop small molecules that enhance Sirt1 activity, offering a novel therapeutic approach. By targeting Sirt1, these molecules can potentially mitigate AD progression, providing a promising strategy for developing effective treatments. In this present work, a pharmacophore containing six features has been designed using the Sirt1 macromolecule crystal structure using the Discovery Studio 2.0 software and validated by the Gunery-Henery (GH) Scoring method. The GH scores have been found in the acceptable range. Further, validated pharmacophores have been used for exploring the plant-derived database to retrieve the novel hits employing various parameters viz fit value, Lipinski rule of five violation, feature mapping, in silico pharmacokinetics and toxicological studies. After the virtual screening process, 24-24 molecules from the ZINC and FDA-approved database have been retrieved which have been further subjected to molecular docking to determine the binding interactions with the Sirt1 enzyme's active binding sites using the LibDock module in DS 2.0 software. Based on binding energy and binding interactions 2-2 molecules from the ZINC database and FDA-approved database have been selected for the molecular dynamic simulation. The knowledge obtained in this study may help reveal commercially available compounds that can become potent activators of Sirt1.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive cognitive decline, memory impairment, and behavioural changes1,2. It is marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain3. Despite extensive research, there is still no cure for AD, and current treatments only offer limited symptomatic relief. Consequently, there is a pressing need for novel therapeutic approaches to address the disease's underlying causes and halt its progression4,5. Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) is a member of the Sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases and has garnered significant attention due to its involvement in regulating various cellular processes, including ageing, metabolism, and stress responses6. In the context of neurodegeneration, SIRT1 is particularly noteworthy for its potential neuroprotective effects7. SIRT1 exerts its beneficial effects by deacetylating and modulating the activity of several key proteins and transcription factors involved in neuronal survival, inflammation, and metabolic regulation. These properties make SIRT1 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in AD8. Research has demonstrated that SIRT1 activation can positively influence several pathological processes associated with AD 9. For instance, SIRT1 activation has been shown to reduce the production of Aβ peptides, one of the primary culprits in AD pathology10. This is achieved through the deacetylation and activation of retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ), which subsequently increases the expression of ADAM10, an enzyme that promotes the non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) 11. Additionally, SIRT1 can modulate tau pathology by deacetylating and stabilizing microtubules, thus reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. These findings suggest that SIRT1 activation could mitigate key pathological features of AD and confer neuroprotection11. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in modern medicinal chemistry that involves designing molecules with specific interactions based on the three-dimensional structure of a target protein12. The resolved crystal structure of SIRT1 provides critical insights into its active site and binding pockets, facilitating the design of small molecules that can specifically bind to and modulate SIRT1 activity13. This rational approach allows for the identification and optimization of compounds that enhance SIRT1 activity, offering a promising pathway for developing new therapeutic agents for AD. In the SBDD process, computational techniques such as molecular docking and virtual screening are employed to identify potential SIRT1 activators from extensive libraries of compounds13. These initial hits are then subject to medicinal chemistry efforts to optimize their binding affinity, specificity, and pharmacokinetic properties. The goal is to create molecules that are not only potent SIRT1 activators but also possess favourable characteristics for brain delivery and stability. We intended to find novel modulators using online available databases as prospective therapies targeted to SIRT1 in AD based on the views discussed above. By using the sirt1 structural protein with nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD) interaction as a template structure, we conducted in silico research that considered the construction of a receptor-based pharmacophore model for virtual screening. Following using the created pharmacophore model to virtually screen from the database, the obtained compounds were further filtered for their drug-likeness using Lipinski's Veber's and ADMET filters. An investigation was conducted to determine the binding relationship between the drug-like compounds that were obtained and the sirt1 structural protein with NAD domain pocket residues. In addition, the compounds that were acquired from docking research with the tubulin structural protein were put through significant molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine whether or not they remained stable for a period of fifty nanoseconds. In addition, the compounds that exhibited binding interactions with critical residues of the tubulin structural protein, which were comparable to those shown in the crystallographic structure of the sirt1 structural protein –NAD, were docked with the mutant structure that was produced.","Result and Discussion Generation and validation of receptor-ligand pharmacophore model Using Discovery Studio 2.0 software, six feature pharmacophore were developed which included two hydrogen bond acceptors, two hydrophobic and two hydrogen donors as shown in Fig. 1. This six-feature-based pharmacophore was validated using the Gunery Henery scoring method. The database included 90 decoy compounds and 13 inhibitors that were known to have sirt1. To assess the model's capability to differentiate between active and decoy compounds, the pharmacophore model was used as a 3D query to explore the internal decoy database. The following metrics were computed: total hits (Ht), active hits (Ha), percentage yield of actives, percentage ratio of actives, and GH score. A GH score between 0.7 - 0.8 implies a very commendable model. The observed value for the pharmacophore model was 0.752, as seen in Table 1. The verified findings demonstrate that the model was very effective for database screening. Drug-like compounds retrieved from virtual screening A highly reliable pharmacophore was employed to explore the test compounds database and 1,64,919 compounds from the Zinc database and 1,168 in the FDA-approved database were retrieved. Afterwards, using various filtration parameters including fit values, and feature mapping 167 and 1128 compounds were separated respectively. In addition, Ro5, veber's filters, and in silico pharmacokinetic and toxicological parameters also sorted the compounds (Table S1 and S2) and found 24-24 compounds from the ZINC and FDA-approved databases as shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Molecular docking Following the retrieval of compounds from the ZINC and FDA-approved databases, the molecular docking technique was used to investigate the binding interactions of the compounds that were recovered with the active binding sites of the Sirt1 enzyme domain. The efficiency of the AutoDock Vina technique was assessed before docking these compounds. This was accomplished by re-docking the co-crystallized ligand, NAD, into the Sirt1-binding pocket. Pyrx software was used for this evaluation. The purpose of this re-docking procedure is to act as a validation phase, which ensures that the docking algorithm properly reproduces the known binding mode of the co-crystallized ligand. This, in turn, confirms the dependability of the docking methodology for the following study of the flavonoid compounds. For this reason, we carried out docking of 24-24 compounds derived from ZINC and FDA-approved databases to evaluate the manner in which these compounds interact with the particular residues that are located in the catalytic site of the Sirt1 enzyme. All of the compounds that were retrieved were able to bind themselves to the Sirt1 enzyme with a high docking score, which was higher than the score for the reference compound. It was shown that these chemicals interact with the essential amino acid residues that are found in the Sirt1 protein. The amino acid residues Gln294, Phe297, Tyr280, His363, Gln345, Glu467, Asn465, Asp272, and Asp471 are shown in the Sirt1 crystal structure. For effective binding interactions, it is essential to have Phe273, Ala262, Ser441, Ser442, Arg466, Cys482, Phe414, Val266, and Arg274. The compounds that were recovered showed evidence of binding to the required amino acids, which indicates that they have the qualities needed to interact with the Sirt1 enzyme19,20. This is supported by Table 4, Table 5, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Molecular dynamic simulation MD simulation is used to explore the binding stability of protein-ligand docking complexes. The MD simulation also provides information regarding intermolecular interaction within a reference time. Herein, the complexes docking file of selected two NCI and two plant-based compounds with Sirt1 protein were analysed by utilising MD simulation approaches to confirm the stability and intermolecular interactions between protein and molecules against 100 ns time intervals21. In MD modelling, RMSD was evaluated between the initial and final simulated trajectories, and crucial features including binding interactions and conformation characteristics of the complex were also evaluated. For the enzyme-ligand complex (4i5i) involving ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide, the average RMSD values were found as 2.87, 3.08, 3.03 and 3.10 Å respectively as shown in Fig. 4. These values suggest efficient binding of the ligands with the sirt1 enzyme22,23. The lower RMSD values indicate a relatively stable and consistent binding of these ligands within the enzyme’s active site across the simulation time frame. Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), is an important feature that has to be considered when evaluating the structural flexibility of proteins during MD. In addition to assisting in the evaluation of the influence that ligand binding has on the stability of proteins, it offers knowledge on the fluctuations of certain amino acid residues. For this investigation, we compute RMSF values to investigate the fluctuations that occur within the protein residues when they are attached to ligands. The protein's structural stability might be disrupted if the RMSF value is more than three angstroms, which indicates that there is a possibility of higher amino acid fluctuations following ligand binding. On the other hand, a value of RMSF that is less than three angstroms indicates that there are fewer variations in amino acids, which indicates that the protein is more stable and resistant to structural alterations. The values of the RMSF for the complexes that were chosen for this investigation varied from 0.4 to 3 Å, which indicates that there were moderate variations in the amino acid residues. In terms of the ligands that the protein bound, the average RMSF values were as follows: 1.78, 1.49, 1.70, and 1.60 Å for ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide correspondingly as shown in Fig. 5. Collectively, these RMSF values provide an indication of the complexes' stability as well as their flexibility while the MD simulations were being performed. Compound ZINC000000864920 showed hydrogen bonding interactions with Tyr280, Arg282, Asp286, Gln294, Glu315, Gln345 and Asp348, hydrophobic interactions with Asp286, Glu315, Gln320, Asn346 and Asp348 amino acid residues with active binding active sites of sirt1 enzyme. Similarly, ZINC000096361333 showed hydrogen bonding interactions with Gly261, Ala262, Gly263, Ser266, Phe273, Tyr280, Gln294, Gln345, Asn346, His363, Phe414, Ser442 and Glu467; hydrophobic interactions with Arg274 and Lys444 amino acid residues of sirt1 macromolecules as shown in Fig. 6. Interestingly, Folic acid compound showed hydrogen bond interactions with Ala262, Gly263, Val266, Ser267, Arg274, Asp292, Gln294, Gln345, Gly440, Ser441, Ser442, Leu443, Lys444, Asn465, Arg466, Asp481 and Cyt482 and Bicalutamide showed hydrogen bond interactions with Ala262, Gly263, Val266, Asp272, Phe273, Arg274, Tyr280, His363, Val412, Gly440 and Asn465 amino acid residues of sirt1 active binding sites. Folic acid and Bicalutamide compounds also formed hydrophobic interactions with Ala262, Phe273, Phe297 and Phe414 amino acid residues of sir1 enzyme active binding cavities as shown in Fig. 6. Moreover, to evaluate the protein complexes to solvent molecules and their structural stability, several surface area measurements, such as SASA and rGyr, were analysed. The results revealed that the SASA values for ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide were 13282-14624 Å, 13575-15578 Å, 13523-14792 Å, and 13271-14791 Å, respectively. Additionally, the rGyr values for ZINC000000864920, ZINC000096361333, Folic acid and Bicalutamide were 20.09, 19.81, 19.9, and 22.85 Å, respectively. In the field of drug discovery research, the use of Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) techniques has resulted in the establishment of new standards for the identification of promising chemical compounds that target particular receptors. There is no denying the fact that CADD techniques make a major contribution to the improvement of the drug development pipeline. Through molecular docking, MM-GBSA calculations, and MD simulation investigations, it has been shown that the four compounds that have been offered have a promising affinity for Sirt1 20. At the same time, to evaluate the potential of these compounds against sirt1, multiple experimental verifications must be carried out. An efficient way to determine whether or not the molecules have a strong affinity for one another is the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) test. A kinetic study is an appropriate method to investigate the processes that are responsible for the binding and unbinding of these molecules. Based on the results of the experiments, more optimization of the molecules may be required to enhance their therapeutic potential and maximize their effectiveness."

Abstract
Background: TREM2 signaling has been implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).
TREM2 regulates microglial states and functions such as phagocytosis. The most
prominent TREM signaling adapter is DAP12, encoded by TYROBP. Understanding
functional changes of this complex, and downstream effectors such as SHIP1, PLCG2
and the Scr family kinases Lyn and Hck, is required to evaluate a broad range of
therapeutic hypotheses and drug targets for prioritization and enablement. The lack
of available, well validated, and openly distributed experimental tools can limit early
drug discovery efforts. Therefore, the IUSM Purdue TREAT-AD Center has generated
and validated TREM2 activating antibodies to enable the advancement of drug targets
in the TREM2/DAP12 signaling pathway.
Method: To establish and validate anti-TREM2 agonist antibodies, heavy and light
chain variable sequences were identified from multiple publications including patent
applications. Antibodies were formatted as either human IgG1, Fc null mutant IgG1
or antibody transport vehicle (ATV) Fc null mutant IgG1. They were expressed
in mammalian ExpiCHO cells and tested ex vivo for agonism based on their
ability to activate AKT and Syk phosphorylation in THP1 cells and TREM2/DAP12
overexpressing cells respectively. The strongest agonistic candidate was scaled,
purified, and further characterized biophysically and functionally.
Result: Several agonistic antibodies were identified. AL2p31 antibody showed binding
specificity to human versus murine TREM2. Biophysical characterization using biolayer
interferometry showed that binding kinetic parameters (KD, Kon, and Koff) were
not significantly affected in LALAPG null mutant Fc background. AL2p31 specifically
induced Syk phosphorylation in comparison to an isotype control. Analysis of
